                     Annually funded by student Green Fees, the TIGUrS Urban Garden strives to share with
                     students, volunteers, campus staff, and the community the benefits and techniques
                     that make for a healthy and beautiful green space experience. Since the summer of
                     2009, the award winning* TIGUrS Urban Garden, located on the University of Memphis
                     Main Campus east of the Elma Roane Field House, has served as an evolving model for
                     organic, sustainably-focused gardening within the confines of restrictive urban conditions.
                     TIGUrS has proven that environmentally responsible food production, urban beautification,
                     and stress-reducing green spaces are well within the reach of the urban communities.
                     We avidly encourage your participation as a green volunteer to help further sustainable
                     practices on our campus while accruing values and skills that follow you forth into
                     whatever community you call home. Come Discover More in YOUR Garden. *Winner of the 2012 Tennessee Governor's Environmental Stewardship Award
