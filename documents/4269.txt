                        This research is designed to produce reliable information on children’s policy, identify
                        best practices for advocacy and policy change, and share that research with groups
                        interested in improving the condition of children in Memphis and the Mid-South. Our
                        intention is to build and sustain a political culture that supports optimal childhood
                        development, leading to school success, and improved adult outcomes.

                     Project Description:  My work investigates the psychological processes underlying
                        political behavior.  This particular study focuses on party identification and social
                        interaction.  Research shows that partisan bias can lead citizens to disregard valuable
                        information in an effort to avoid disagreement with their party.  However, relatively
                        little is known about how these processes operate within a social setting.  More specifically,
                        I am interested in determining the conditions under which partisan biases are socially
                        reinforced versus the conditions under which social interaction helps to mitigate
                        these biases and even fosters deliberation.  Given the interdisciplinary nature of
                        my research, I would welcome involvement from students across the social sciences. 
                        Research assistants will primarily be involved in experimental data collection.  This
                        means working in the lab, helping to get the study setup, data management, and possibly
                        coding data once the collection stage is complete.

                     Project Description : I research the political implications of natural disasters for
                        different types of societies. Societies can be any combination of willing and/or able
                        to address the social, humanitarian, political, and economic consequences of natural
                        disasters like floods, droughts, earthquakes, and epidemics. My research asks questions
                        about what makes societies well-prepared for natural disasters, and what the political
                        implications are for the aftermath of these events. One current project focuses on
                        state-by-state responses to natural disasters in the United States. A second project
                        focuses on whether societies are likely to experience conflict or cooperation after
                        natural disasters. I am also working on a project with the Institute for Intelligent
                        Systems on political linguistics. I have more detailed information about my projects
                        on my website as well: http://blogs.memphis.edu/lcwells/research/ . I would welcome students from many disciplines, including political science, GIS,
                        statistics, or other social sciences to help collect and analyze data, and research
                        and review case studies.

                     Project Description : I am currently engaged in research toward a book provisionally
                        entitled “One Money/Many Nations: The Euro, Collective Identity and Political Authority
                        in Europe .” The book addresses the intriguing analytical questions that result from
                        the supra-national nature of Europe's single currency - the Euro: How can the supra-national
                        governance of money function within a framework that still incorporates separate nation-states,
                        diverse societies and integrating markets? Would the European Union have to develop
                        into a full-blown state to achieve successful monetary governance in Europe ? Do previous
                        lessons from the national governance of money apply to the euro, or do we need to
                        reconceptualize completely the governance of money in Europe ? The book reaches beyond
                        the conventional emphasis on institutional structures and markets to emphasize the
                        underlying social foundations for the governance of euro. The book project is located
                        at the intersection of conceptual debates on shifting relationships between markets,
                        politics and societies and its themes evolve around questions of identity, trust and
                        legitimacy. Research assistance involves data collection, web searches for articles,
                        bibliography, research materials selection and review, as well as some editing.
