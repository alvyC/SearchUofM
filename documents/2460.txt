                     The School of Health Studies (SHS) has partnered with Sanda University in Shanghai, China to assist Sanda University professors with the development of
                        a health promotion/health education program which will soon be offered to their undergraduate
                        students. The partnership will allow for both academic and research collaborations,
                        as well as opportunities for students and faculty from both institutions to travel
                        and study within the partnership program. Dr. Bloomer and faculty from the SHS recently
                        met with Sanda University administrators and faculty to discuss and confirm this collaborative

                     Through collaboration with the Church Health Center, a new graduate certificate in
                        Faith and Health is being offered starting fall 2016. The coursework focuses on the
                        intersection of faith and health—providing students with knowledge and understanding
                        of how these two key areas influence one another in providing patient care. Consisting
                        of 12 credit hours, students will take part in two hybrid (in-class/on-line) courses
                        and two practicum courses (utilizing the Experiential Learning Credit). For more information,

                     Grant to Study the Dietary Supplement MSM
                     
                     Dr. Bloomer received a grant from Bergstrom Nutrition to study the dietary supplement
                        MSM, a popular ingredient used to prevent and treat inflammation. Recent work from
                        his lab has noted that a daily dosage of 3 grams of MSM results in a significant increase
                        in blood MSM after just two weeks of treatment, with a continued rise in blood MSM
                        after four weeks of treatment. The present study seeks to investigate the impact of
                        escalating dosages of MSM over a four month period in relation to blood MSM concentrations
                        in men.

                     SHS Faculty Member Honored
                     
                     The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at The University of Memphis recently
                        honored a School of Health Studies faculty member, Dr. Carol Irwin, Associate Professor,
                        Physical Education Teacher Education, as one of three UofM faculty members for her
                        scholarly contributions toward their mission of social justice at the Institute's
                        Annual Gala on April 21st, 2016. Dr. Irwin's research focuses on the public health
                        issue of minority children's "no or low" swimming ability, and their subsequent elevated
                        fatal and non-fatal drowning rates. Since 2009 along with dedicated community partners,
                        Dr. Irwin has supported and evaluated a free/low cost "learn to swim" program called
                        Splash Mid-South as a viable solution to enhance swimming ability and decrease drowning
                        rates for Memphis area children.

                     Stop Hunger Now Event a Success
                     
                     Students, faculty and staff from the School of Health Studies and The University of
                        Memphis came together on April 6, 2016 to pack meals for overseas disaster areas and
                        parts of the world where children do not get enough to eat. Clinical Nutrition Graduate
                        Intern, Christina Ralston, worked on setting up this event. She successfully raised
                        over $3,900, which allowed for the packaging of approximately 13,000 meals for the
                        Stop Hunger Now organization—meals that were then provided to feed those in need.

                     Undergraduate Student Publishes Two First-Author Articles
                     
                     Former Exercise and Sport Science undergraduate student Daniel Kuhman has published
                        two scientific articles from research he conducted in the Musculoskeletal Analysis
                        Laboratory under the guidance of Dr. Max Paquette.
                     
                     
                     The first article titled "Ankle and knee kinetics between strike patterns at common
                        training speeds in competitive male runners" was published in the European Journal
                        of Sport Science in late 2015. This work was completed as part of the Helen Hardin
                        Summer Research Fellowship program. The second article titled "Comparison of ankle
                        kinematics and ground reaction forces between prospectively injured and uninjured
                        collegiate cross country runners" was published in Human Movement Science earlier
                        this year. This work was completed as part of Daniel's senior project.
                     
                     
                     Daniel's work sheds light onto the mechanisms associated with the development of running-related
                        injuries. The findings from his work will help scientists and clinicians prevent injury
                        development by identifying at-risk runners using biomechanical variables. Daniel graduated
                        from the Exercise and Sport Science program in May 2015 and is now pursuing a Master's
                        degree in the field of biomechanics at East Carolina University.

                     Graduate Students Publish Peer-Reviewed Manuscript
                     
                     Graduate students working in the Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Lab under the direction
                        of Dr. Bloomer published a manuscript entitled, "The influence of a passion flower
                        extract on free testosterone in healthy men" in the journal Integrative Molecular
                        Medicine. The research highlights the potential benefit of a plant-based dietary agent
                        to increase testosterone in older men, while favorably impacting subjective feelings
                        such as libido and energy level. To view the full text paper, click here .

                     SPAHCC Staff Member Achieves World Indoor Track & Field Championships Standard
                     
                     On Saturday February 13th, one of the SPAHCC staff members, Lauren Paquette, competed
                        at the Vanderbilt Music City Challenge indoor track and field meet in the 3000m. Lauren
                        ran away from the field in the last 1000m to win in a facility record time of 8:57.78.
                        This was an 11 second personal record for Lauren and also the fastest 3000m ever run
                        on Tennessee soil by a woman. Her time also bested the World Indoor Championship standard
                        (9:00.00) and ranks her 6th in the U.S. and 18th in the World for the 3000m. For perspective,
                        a time of 8:57 in the 3000m is achieved by running two back-to-back miles in 4:48. Lauren is now preparing for the U.S. Indoor Track Championships to be held in Portland,
                        Oregon March 11th-12th where she will need a top 3 finish to earn a spot on the U.S.
                        team for the World Championships which will also be held in Portland one week later.

                     Concerned About Diet Sodas?
                     
                     Investigators within the School of Health Studies recently published a paper entitled,
                        "Blood glucose and insulin response to artificially- and sugar-sweetened sodas in
                        healthy men" which was designed to determine whether or not diet sodas induce an increase
                        in blood insulin—a concern that has been raised in the lay press recently. High levels
                        of insulin are associated with the metabolic syndrome and the accumulation of excess
                        body fat. The authors concluded that "Artificially sweetened sodas containing sucralose
                        or aspartame do not result in any acute elevation in blood sugar or insulin following
                        a 20 ounce load. There is no reason to suspect that a higher consumption would result
                        in an elevation in these measures. Any noted insulin resistance linked to high intake
                        of artificial sweeteners is likely a function of the excess calories and processed
                        ingredients often included within artificially-sweetened food and beverage products."

                     Strong Turnout for the Running Science Symposium
                     
                     After an overwhelmingly positive response leading up to the Running Science Symposium,
                        over 120 runners of all skill level showed up last night, despite wet conditions,
                        to get tips and insights. Although we were unable to answer all 80 questions submitted
                        to the Symposium in the 90 minute time slot, our panel was able to address the common
                        themes amongst a majority of the questions. In the coming months, we plan to organize
                        a seminar series focused on specific running-related topics such as training, injuries,
                        running form, nutrition and more. We would like to thank our partners OrthoMemphis , Breakaway Running , and Schilling Nutrition Therapy for their help and expertise as well as everyone who was able to attend.

                     Dr. Bloomer has received research funding to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile
                        of theacrine, a novel and emerging plant-based ingredient that is now being used within
                        dietary supplements. Theacrine is a purine alkaloid found primarily in the leaves
                        of the Camellia Kucha plant and has been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory/
                        analgesic, anti-depressive, locomotor, and sedative/hypnotic properties. The study
                        will be performed in conjunction with the College of Pharmacy at the University of
                        Tennessee Health Science Center.

                     New Award: MSM as a sulfur donor
                     
                     Dr. Randy Buddington was recently awarded funding to investigate the incorporation
                        of sulfur donated from methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) into rodent tissue. Sulfur is third
                        most abundant mineral element in the body and is associated almost exclusively with
                        amino acids. There is concern of the adequacy of the Western diet to provide adequate
                        levels of sulfur to meet the need for synthesis of sulfur containing amino acids.
                        Supplementing the diet with sulfur amino acids poses risks. Hence, alternative sources
                        of sulfur are needed. This study will validate MSM as a sulfur donor based on incorporation
                        of labeled sulfur into proteins.

                     OOFOS Footwear Company Grant - Dr. Max Paquette
                     
                     Dr. Max Paquette recently received a grant from the OOFOS Footwear Company to study
                        the effects of footwear on recovery parameters following a marathon.
                     
                     
                     The purposes of this funded study are to: 1) compare self-reported fatigue, muscle
                        soreness and inflammation when wearing one of three different types of footwear in
                        the days following a marathon and, 2) compare ankle and knee motion among the three
                        footwear types during level-walking.
                     
                     
                     Investigators will randomly assign runners participating in the St-Jude Memphis Marathon
                        (December 5th) to one of three footwear groups including a control group. In the weeks
                        before the marathon, the movement of their ankles and knees will be measured during
                        a laboratory session among the three footwear types. Then, immediately following the
                        marathon, runners will be asked to wear the footwear type assigned to them for three
                        days following the race. Before, immediately after, and in the days following the
                        marathon, self-reported fatigue and muscle soreness will be measured in addition to
                        muscle inflammation.
                     
                     
                     These findings may help runners and coaches decide which footwear type may be more
                        effective in speeding up recovery following a marathon.

                     New Neonatal Research Facility in Roane Fieldhouse
                     
                     The first day of life is the most dangerous day of life and because of the immaturity
                        of critical organ systems, this is really true for preterm infants. Unfortunately,
                        preterm birth remains the most common cause of neonatal death and especially here
                        in Memphis and Shelby Country. Investigators in the School of Health Studies, in collaboration
                        with neonatologists, healthcare personnel, and industry partners are leading the world
                        in advancing the care of preterm infants.
                     
                     
                     UM research is not only helping more preterm infants survive those first hours and
                        days after birth, it is helping preterm infants grow and develop normally and become
                        healthy children. Notably, lung immaturity and inability to breathe (asphyxia) is
                        the leading cause of preterm death. Research at UM is improving methods for providing
                        ventilation support for preterm infants. Additional UM research is improving nutrition
                        support for preterm infants improving growth and development of the brain.
                     
                     
                     The Fieldhouse is not only the site of intense athletic competition, it is now supporting
                        research that is saving the lives of infants and providing them with the chance to
                        one day become Tigers.

                     Grocery Store Tours with Clinical Nutrition Interns
                     
                     The Clinical Nutrition Interns, members of the Student Dietetics Association and the
                        Veteran's Administration Medical Center Interns provided grocery store tours at various
                        Kroger stores in Memphis. Participants in the tours reported that they learned a great
                        deal about which foods are more healthy and 83% said they would change their intake
                        of fruits and vegetables after taking the tour. Funding for the tours was provided
                        by the Better Produce for Health Foundation and Kroger. Below is the YouTube video
                        of a tour.

                     Sport Commerce Students Work with Jackson Generals
                     
                     Sport Commerce Master's students enrolled in Sport Marketing and Sport Promotions
                        and Information Services classes worked in a consultant role with the Jackson Generals
                        of Minor League Baseball's Southern League. As part of a grant funded by the Sport
                        Marketing Association, the students in the classes completed projects to help the
                        Generals better market and promote their product to existing and potential fans.
                     
                     
                     Students shared their work with the Jackson Generals in December 2014, and made presentations
                        to the organization in April 2015 focused on increasing attendance at games. The Generals
                        are currently working to implement an idea presented by Andrea Wensits to enhance
                        educational days held by the organization for school-aged children in the Jackson
                        area.
