                     Scholarship Support
                     
                     Scholarships may be need-based, merit-based or a combination of both, and they may
                        be designated to any academic area. They may be established as an award with a minimum
                        annual investment of $2000 or endowed at any level above $30,000. We will work with
                        you on naming the fund and designing the award criteria. Through scholarship support
                        you can make an impact on a student that could change their life forever!
