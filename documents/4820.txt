                     For many students, college is a whole new world when it comes to studying and rigor.
                        But that doesn't mean you have to struggle. The Educational Support Program (ESP)
                        offers a variety of services to get you on track. At our Learning Centers and through
                        Supplemental Instruction (SI), we can talk about the difficulties you are facing and
                        ways to improve—like tutoring in a specific course, writing skills for any assignments,
                        study habit strategies, time management allocation, and conquering test anxieties.
                        Free services are available to all current UofM graduate and undergraduate students.
