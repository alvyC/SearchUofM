                     The Department of Communication at The University of Memphis offers both a Bachelor
                        of Arts and a Master of Arts Degree in Communication with a concentration in Film
                        and Video Production. These concentrations combine technical instruction with courses
                        in motion picture studies to provide students with the skills necessary to function
                        in the multifaceted world of audiovisual production. Our approach to media practice
                        is broad enough to address the needs of the independent artist as well as those who
                        wish to enter the industry, and the film program is small enough to ensure that each
                        student receives personal attention from the faculty.
