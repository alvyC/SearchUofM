                     Dynamic Forms Entry Instructions
                     
                     The Graduate School is pleased to release a paperless process for graduate faculty
                        status applications. Please carefully follow the directions below to create an application
                        or approve an application submitted to you. For those who approve applications, please
                        read the instruction sets for both applicants and approvers to be familiarized with
                        the electronic review process. If you have questions regarding the instructions below,
                        please contact Rodrigo Silva-Lugo ( Rodrigo.Silva@memphis.edu ) or Dr. James Kierulff ( jkerulff@memphis.edu ). Thank you.
                     
                     
                     Applicants (Faculty):
                     
                     
                        
                        Academic department faculty status application review procedures may require the involvement
                           of your chair, academic department committee, college counsel and college dean. For
                           some departments, not all of these entities are needed. Your first step is to determine,
                           before starting your application, who will be reviewing your application. For this
                           electronic application you will only need to know who will approve your application
                           at the chair and dean level. You will be entering their names and email addresses
                           into the application. (Note separately committee and counsel representatives if needed.
                           You will need to forward your application and supporting documentation by email to
                           the respective chairs or their assigned.) If you do not have either a chair or college
                           dean (as is the case for some departments), please use an equivalent. Two unique signatures
                           of authority are needed to process a faculty status form.

                        To approve the form:
                           
                           
                              
                              Click on the respective checkbox at the bottom, to confirm that the application has
                                 gone through the appropriate Department Committee/College Council. This is an optional step, since there may not be a Committee/Council. (Note: The Chair
                                    is designated to account for the Departmental Committee review of the applicant, the
                                    College Dean is designated to account for the College Council review. If the Chair
                                    or Dean is not in agreement with the respective committee/council decision, the chair
                                    or dean cannot move forward with a decision on the application until an agreement
                                    has been reached.) If there is no Department Committee/College Council do not click
                                    the respective checkbox.
                              
                              Enter the name of the Committee Chair or Council Chair as appropriate.
                              
                              Click on the Next button.
                              
                              
                              On the next screen, enter your signature, and click on the Sign Electronically button.
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        To reject the form:
                           
                           
                              
                              Click on the Reject button. Similar to the approval process above, the Chair or Dean must be in agreement
                                 with their respective Committee or Council decision (if a Committee or Council is
                                 applicable) before taking action on the application.
                              
                              
                              On the next screen, you will be able to send an email message to the previous form
                                 signer, and let them know the reason why the form has been rejected. They will be
                                 able to review, and/or re-submit the form.
                              
                              
                              Once you have written the message, click on the Reject this form button.
