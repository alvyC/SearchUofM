                     Tiger Success Institute: Introduction
                     
                     The Suder Foundation, in collaboration with Northern Arizona University and The University
                        of Memphis invites first-generation students to participate in the Tiger Success Institute and become a First-Generation Ambassador. Undergraduate students at all class levels
                        are encouraged to apply.   Please note that the application for fall 2016 is now closed.
                     
                     Why First-Gen?
                     
                     First-generation college students are students whose parents have not earned a 4-year
                        college degree.
                     
                     
                     First-generation college students frequently lack the cultural capital necessary for
                        a smooth transition to college. They often do not have knowledge, skills, educational
                        preparation and other advantages needed to make the higher education system a comfortable,
                        familiar environment. Additionally, first-gen students often feel isolated at college:
                        they report limited support from parents, university faculty, staff and peers.
                     
                     
                     We find that many first-gen college students overcome significant life challenges
                        to achieve college enrollment as the first in their family. We believe that these
                        life experiences hold a depth of character, courage and determination that demonstrate
                        unique potential. First Scholars is designed to empower this potential. By channeling
                        Scholars’ personal strengths to develop skills and opportunities, our program helps
                        them build a solid foundation for graduation-and a fulfilled life of self-awareness,
                        personal success and significance.
                     
                     
                     Benefits

                     By completing the Institute and earning your certification as a First-Generation Ambassador,
                        you will improve your college portfolio and resume, becoming more competitive for
                        leadership roles on campus and employment after college.
                     
                     
                     How the Institute Works
                     
                     The Institute kicks off with an orientation session, followed by a series of 10 workshops,
                        concluded with a capstone event. Each workshop session is 90 minutes long, and includes
                        time to connect with fellow attendees, learn something new about college success strategies,
                        and develop and action plan for your own success in college and beyond. To complete
                        your certification, students need just complete 5 workshops of your choice of the
                        10 available and participate in both orientation and capstone programs. You can become
                        a First-Generation Ambassador in just 12.5 hours.
