                     ITS releases new Duo Account Security service
                     
                     Information Technology Services (ITS), in conjunction with National Cyber Security
                        Awareness Month, has released the new Duo Account Security service. As cyber criminals
                        increasingly turn to phishing and other social engineering attacks, securing your
                        account and the information you access has never been more important. Duo Account
                        Security offers a method to protect your account by requiring a secondary means of
                        authentication in addition to your password. Instructions for enabling and using the
                        Duo Account Security service are available here.
