                     Love and war are surely a powerful narrative in this new romance based on the real
                        life letters sent across the world during World War II 65 years ago. Ordinary men
                        and women meet extraordinary challenges during the World War II era. The men are facing
                        the draft or are in uniform. Some see action. The women are lonely and dealing with
                        shortages. Their letters are candid, sad and funny. The common theme is a longing
                        for the loved one. The letters were saved by Eva Lee Brown of Easley, SC and discovered
                        more than 50 years later by her daughter Catherine Ladnier.
