                     The University of Memphis serves as a national test center for all DSST exams; because
                        policies regarding DSST credits differ at various institutions, candidates should
                        verify with their respective school on which exams are accepted.Â  All DSST exams offer
                        immediate scoring with the exception of: Principles of Public Speaking.
