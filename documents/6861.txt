                     A panel on workforce trends in the information technology industry was held at the
                     AMCIS meeting in Toronto, Canada, in August 2008. Panelists discussed a continuing
                     research project about the current state of the IT workforce and future trends, sponsored
                     by the Society for Information Management (SIM). The initial phase was a study of
                     workforce trends in IT client companies, completed in 2006. Results from phase one
                     revealed a shift in the mission of the information system function from delivering
                     technology-based solutions to managing the process of delivering solutions. Client-facing
                     capabilities were found to be critical to this mission as well as business and project-management
                     capabilities.
                     
                     Phase two examined workforce trends in IT provider companies. Results indicate that
                        provider firms are also seeking client-facing capabilities, project management and
                        business domain knowledge over technical capabilities. Panelists compared the results
                        of the two phases and the implications for curriculum design, hiring, and training
                        practices.
                     
                     
                     The results of this research underline a looming crisis in several areas: 1) graduates
                        who are not trained in areas that the marketplace is seeking; 2) thin pipeline for
                        specific technical skills; 3) increasing pressure to source IT capability; and 4)
                        lag in university responsiveness to the needs of the marketplace.
