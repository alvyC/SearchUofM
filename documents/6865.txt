                     Computer-based communication technologies are increasingly important to personal and
                     organizational communication. One important factor related to the adoption and diffusion
                     of communication innovations is critical mass. Critical mass influences the adoption
                     and diffusion of interactive communication innovations, both through network externalities
                     and through sustainability of the innovation. Unfortunately, critical mass is difficult
                     to measure and is typically only demonstrable after the critical mass point has been
                     reached. Potential adopters' perceptions of critical mass also may be important to
                     adoption decisions. In this paper, we extend this thinking using a synthesis of the
                     Theory of Reasoned Action and Diffusion of Innovation theory by developing a research
                     model. The model is empirically tested using survey data that are analyzed using partial
                     least squares. The focal innovation is instant messaging. Results indicate that perceived
                     critical mass influences use intentions directly and through perceptions of the characteristics
                     of the innovation. The perceived innovation characteristics impact attitude toward
                     use, which in turn impacts use intentions. The model predicts a sizable and significant
                     portion of both attitudes and use intentions. Further, perceived critical mass is
                     able to explain a significant portion of the variance in each perceived innovation
                     characteristic. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
