                     What is Civil Engineering
                     
                     Civil Engineering is the oldest branch of engineering. The Roman aqueducts and the
                        pyramids of Egypt are early examples of civil engineering works. Originally, the name
                        "civil" was used to distinguish this type of "civilian" project from those done for
                        the military.
                     
                     
                     Today, civil engineering encompasses a wide range of projects and activities for the
                        welfare and safety of the general public. Civil Engineers are responsible for the
                        planning, design, and construction of such projects as bridges, buildings, highways,
                        traffic control systems, and facilities for the treatment of water supplies and waste
                        water. Civil Engineers are also involved in solving the problems of hazardous waste
