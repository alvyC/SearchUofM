The Memphis Enquirer was founded in March 1836 as a weekly Whig Party newspaper.  Its chief rivals in the 1830s were the Memphis Gazette and the Memphis Western World , both Democratic-leaning newspapers.  In the 1840s its chief rival was the Democratic-leaning Memphis Appeal .  In 1851 the Enquirer merged with the Memphis Eagle to become the Memphis Eagle-Enquirer .
