                        Audible, the spoken audio entertainment company and division of Amazon, bought and
                           produced several new stories by Cary Holladay, professor of English. The titles are
                           "Operator," "Forty Seconds," "You Are Free, Go and Fight," "The Best Party Ever" and
                           "The Army Disease." Professional actors perform the readings. The stories are available
                           here . Congrats, Professor Holladay.
                        
                        
                        Congratulations to Dale Williams for winning Third Place for her carnival-themed display
                           at Discover Your Major Day! Thanks to all the volunteers who helped out! We had so
                           much fun!
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           The English Department is announcing that the MFA program has temporarily stopped
                                 accepting applications for students who want to specialize in Creative Nonfiction.
                                 Because of a reduction in the number of tenured and tenure-track Creative Writing
                                 faculty members, the CW faculty felt it would be most beneficial to students going
                                 forward to focus our resources on Fiction and Poetry. We will continue to offer high
                                 quality Creative Nonfiction classes at both the graduate and undergraduate levels
                                 and all currently enrolled students will be able to finish their degree in Creative
                                 Nonfiction. We will simply not be recruiting MFA students who want to write a Creative
                                 Nonfiction thesis, until we can provide them with an adequate number of qualified
                                 faculty. For the Creative Writing Coordinator's letter to students on this matter,
