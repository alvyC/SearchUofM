                     UofM Receives Grant From Urban Childhood Institute to Serve Vulnerable Children
                     
                     May 25, 2016 - The Urban Child Institute has awarded the University of Memphis a $2
                        million grant to support the ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) Prevention Project.
                     
                     
                     Through the project, the UofM will build on relationships with the University of Tennessee
                        Health Science Center and Le Bonheur Children's Hospital to create a culture of health
                        for vulnerable children in Memphis. The University and its partners will tackle such
                        issues as child neglect and abuse, housing, asthma and breastfeeding.
                     
                     
                     ACE awareness training will be integrated into nursing, public health, law, social
                        work, child development, nonprofit administration and public administration curricula.
                        Resources will be developed for training parents, teachers and others to foster a
                        culture of health for at-risk children, with a particular focus on those from birth
                        to 3 years old.
                     
                     
                     The interdisciplinary initiative will involve four major program areas: The Medical/Legal ACE Initiatives , which includes the Memphis CHiLD Clinic (Children's Health Law Directive), a collaboration
                        between the UofM School of Law, Memphis Legal Services and Le Bonheur providing legal
                        services and advocacy for families in need, and iHeLP ACE Policy Lab, a year-long
                        practicum where law students investigate how existing laws can be used to advance
                        health and reveal gaps where new laws may be needed; the Strengthening Families/Serving Children Initiative , which will provide services to families impacted by violence in targeted areas;
                        Early Childhood ACE Awareness , which will promote comprehensive training to certify teachers and child care providers
                        in ACE awareness; and the Nursing ACE Initiative , which includes the Nursing ACE Awareness Program, an effort to improve health for
                        at-risk children, and the Nursing Asthma Awareness Management Program, which will
                        focus on identifying asthma cases, recognizing high-risk cases, supervising asthma
                        drug administration, and care management and coordination.
                     
                     
                     "Receiving this grant from the Urban Child Institute is a testament to the high quality
                        of researchers and practitioners at the University of Memphis who are engaged in scholarly
                        activities that impact the lives of children and the families within the urban community,"
                        said Provost Karen Weddle-West. "The University's contributions to the Adverse Childhood
                        Experiences Prevention Project will help to ensure the implementation of holistic,
                        integrated approaches to enhancing the health and educational environments of the
                        most needy infants and toddlers in the area."
