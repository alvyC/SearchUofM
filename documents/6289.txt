                     About the Robert Marchini Scholarship
                     
                     About Dr. Marchini
                     
                     Dr. Robert Marchini received the Distinguished Teaching Award in 2008. Professor Robert
                        "Bob" Marchini has been teaching at the U of M since 1967. He also served as the undergraduate
                        advisor and laboratory coordinator in his department and advisor for both Sigma Pi
                        Sigma and the Society of Physics Students. He is well known for his "Magic of Physics"
                        demonstrations, in which he uses an assortment of magician-like tricks to illustrate
                        principles of physics.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Marchini won the University's Distinguished Teaching Award in 1980 and the Thomas
                        W. Briggs Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2001. He has been recognized
                        by the Tennessee Science Teachers Association and the Tennessee Academy of Science
                        for his service to the science teaching community.
                     
                     
                     One of Dr. Marchini's greatest contributions to the department, according to Department
                        Chair Shah Jahan, is in the number of students he brings into physics. "Fully half
                        of all of our physics students are ones who changed their majors after being taught
                        by Dr. Marchini." Noting that "one can always find students in his office from early
                        to late", Dr. Jahan states that "the passion he brings to the teaching of physics
                        is contagious, and students just want to be part of this great intellectual exercise.
                        He is the "Pied Piper of Physics."
                     
                     
                     If you are a former student who has been touched by Dr. Marchini, and would like to
                        give in his honor, please follow the instructions below.
