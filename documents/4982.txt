                     This project explores interactions between cognition and emotion during the learning
                        of scientific methods in the context of a computer tutoring environment. The primary
                        focus is on the relations between impasses, cognitive disequilibrium, and confusion.
                        Confusion is an emotion that correlates with learning gains because it is diagnostic
                        of cognitive disequilibrium, a state that occurs when learners face obstacles to goals,
                        contradictions, incongruities, anomalies, conflicts, and system breakdowns. Cognitive
                        equilibrium is normally restored after thought, reflection, problem solving and other
                        effortful cognitive activities. Therefore, pedagogical tactics that challenge, perplex,
                        and productively confuse learners are stimulating alternatives to the typical information
                        delivery systems that promote shallow knowledge in the comfort zone of the learner,
                        but rarely deep comprehension. However, the cognitive-affective amalgamation of cognitive
                        disequilibrium and confusion does not directly guarantee deep learning, but rather
                        is a promising opportunity for promoting deep learning. This 3-year project develops
                        tutorial interventions that induce, track, and regulate confusion and cognitive disequilibrium
                        in the minds of learners. There are three specific objectives: (1) To promote deep
                        learning by developing tutorial interventions that experimentally induce impasses,
                        cognitive disequilibrium, and the resulting confusion; (2) to integrate sensing devices
                        and signal processing algorithms that detect and track the associated confusion; and
                        (3) to develop affect-sensitive pedagogical strategies that are designed to help learners
                        regulate their confusion. The three objectives will be realized by augmenting an existing
                        Intelligent Tutoring System, called Operation ARIES! (Acquiring Research Investigative
                        and Evaluative Skills) with technologies that are designed to provide automated affective
                        and cognitive assessment and an intelligent handling of emotions. The tutorial trialogues
                        of ARIES will be enhanced by integrating state-of-the-art sensing devices that identify
                        affective states during learning (confusion, frustration, boredom, flow/engagement,
                        etc) on the basis of the dialogue history, conversational cues, facial expressions,
                        and body posture.
