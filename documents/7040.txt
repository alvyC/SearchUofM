                     The University of Memphis Design Collaborative (UMDC) is a university based design
                        center focused on civic engagement and community service through urban design and
                        development.
                     
                     
                     Developing from a relationship between the Memphis Regional Design Center and the
                        University of Memphis, the UMDC has become an outreach branch of the University. The
                        UMDC is a joint venture between the Department of Architecture and Department of City
                        and Regional Planning, harnessing the skills of both departments to benefit the city
                        of Memphis. 
                     
                     
                     The UMDC functions through an advanced studio course for graduate and undergraduate
                        students in Architecture and students in City and Regional Planning. It is through
                        the studio will work on the initiatives to combat critical community challenges within
                        the Memphis and surrounding region. The initiatives and critical challenges stem from
