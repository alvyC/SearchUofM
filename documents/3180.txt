                        Follow up with the student
                        
                        Based on the studentâ€™s response, referral to the BIT may be appropriate.Â  Contact

                     Responses to Disruptive Behavior:
                     
                     
                        
                        Verbally ask that the disruptive behavior stop
                        
                        If behavior does not stop, ask the person to leave the area
                        
                        If the student refuses to comply with your directive, consider contacting the Police
                           Services (901.678.4357)
                        
                        
                        Inform the student of the expected behavior changes, timeline for changes, and the
                           consequences should behavior not change
                        
                        
                        Document all interactions with the student
                        
                        Failure on the studentâ€™s part to respond accordingly to your directives may indicate
                           the need for referral of the matter to the BITÂ 
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Responses to Threatening Behavior:
                     
                     
                        
                        If physical violence has transpired or is imminent, immediately contact Police Services
                           at 901.678.4357
                        
                        
                        Forward information to the BIT as soon as possible
                        
                        Do not attempt to initiate contact with a student if you feel it would endanger your
                           safety
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Responding to Threats of Self-Harm/Suicide:
                     
                     When a student makes any reference to suicide, threat of suicide, or attempt at suicide,
                        a judgment should be made by a mental health professional about the seriousness of
                        a possible suicidal thought or behavior.
                     
                     
                     References to or threats of self-harm should be treated seriously. Mental health evaluations
                        and treatment are available at the Counseling Center at 901.678.2068.
                     
                     
                     Suicide attempts are first and foremost a medical emergency. If dangerous or suicidal
                        behavior appears imminent or has already occurred, contact Police Services at 901.678.4357
                        or dial 911.
                     
                     
                     *Please remember that instances that involve an immediate risk/threat to the University
                           community should be referred to University of Memphis Police Services at 901.678.4357.
