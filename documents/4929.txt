                     About the GenCyber Boot Camp
                     
                     The University of Memphis is excited to host the 2016 GenCyber Boot Camp for middle
                        and high school students. The camp will cover various aspects of Cyber Hygiene and
                        students will learn about privacy, security and safe browsing on the Internet. They
                        will also be introduced to cyber ethics and participate in hands-on sessions that
                        are educational, fun and challenging. There will be opportunities to meet cyber experts
                        and industry professionals.
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     The week will culminate in a competition where students will demonstrate online activities
                        following best practices. This day camp is funded in part by the National Security
                        Agency through their GenCyber program and there is no cost for attending the camp.
