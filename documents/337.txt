                     A research team made up of two UofM professors and students in the Departments of
                           Mechanical Engineering and Physics are paving the way for space exploration to Mars
                           and beyond.
                     
                     By Greg Russell
                     
                     The next generation of manned space missions — such as a journey to Mars — will require
                        new technologies to manage fluids in low gravity. Three University of Memphis mechanical
                        engineering students, along with Drs. Jeffrey Marchetta and Firouzeh Sabri, are conducting
                        research that will pave the way for space exploration to faraway places. The three students, William Parker, David Pumroy and Douglas Williams, recently won
                        first place in the Team Division of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
                        (AIAA) Region II Student Conference for a paper they wrote on the research: "A Feasibility
                        Experiment of a Small Scale RTV-655 Cryogenic Liquid Container for Space Applications." "Most people would not associate the University of Memphis with space-related research,
                        so this type of recognition is important because it emphasizes that the University
                        is actively involved in research aimed at advancing space exploration and has high-quality
                        students contributing to this effort," says Marchetta, associate professor of mechanical
                        engineering and undergraduate adviser. The students working on the project are having the opportunity to visit the NASA test
                        centers and work with NASA personnel.
                     
                     
                     Marchetta and Sabri, associate professor of physics and materials science, say that
                        in space, fluids "behave in strange and unfamiliar ways."
                     
                     
                     
                        
                                   Dr. Jeffrey Marchetta
                        
                     
                     
                     Marchetta says, for instance, "When a person fills up a cup with water on Earth, the
                        water settles to the bottom of the cup because of gravity. If that same cup of water
                        is placed in low gravity, then the water might end up anywhere in the cup.
                     
                     
                     "Fluids are important for life support, plumbing, rockets and many other systems,
                        which are vital for humans who will live and work in space for long periods of time.
                        Engineers and scientists continue to try to understand this behavior and think of
                        new ways to manage fluids in space."
                     
                     
                     With support from NASA and the Tennessee Space Grant Consortium, current research
                        activities in the UofM's Department of Mechanical Engineering are focusing on handling
                        very low temperature (cryogenic) liquids such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen,
                        in low gravity. Liquid hydrogen is an essential fuel, called a propellant, for rockets.
                        The rockets that will transport humans from the Earth to Mars will require enormous
                        fuel tanks. This liquid fuel must be contained at low temperatures for long periods
                        of time in the harsh environments found in space and on other planets.
                     
                     
                     "The temperatures of objects in space and on planets can be as cold as -250 Fahrenheit
                        or as hot as +250 Fahrenheit," says Marchetta. "In the Department of Mechanical Engineering,
                        we are developing and testing new technologies to manage and store these low-temperature
                        fuels in low gravity so that humans will one day be able to travel to and establish
                        colonies on the moon, Mars and beyond."
                     
                     
                     
                        
                                  Dr. Firouzeh Sabri
                        
                     
                     
                     The researchers are investigating the potential of polymer-based liquid cryogenic
                        containers that could be used for long-term space missions to distant destinations.
                     
                     
                     The UofM team is collaborating with other scientists and engineers from the Marshall
                        Space Flight Center, the Kennedy Space Center and NASA Glenn Space Center to test
                        prototypes of models developed on the University's campus.
                     
                     
                     For Parker, a UofM Honors student, he has been able to immerse himself in two areas
                        of the research. "I have been doing work on the experimental and the computational
                        parts of the project," he says. "Last summer and fall, I was focused on the experimental
                        part of the work where we constructed and tested a prototype tank to prove the feasibility
                        of the concept.
                     
                     
                     "Currently, I am focused on developing a computational model of the prototype tank
                        that we have already constructed to better our understanding of its mechanical behavior.
                     
                     
                     "I think that I have been enjoying the computational work a little bit more because
                        of how challenging it has been. Definitely the most enjoyable part of the project
                        was when our whole research group got to present our research at the American Institute
                        of Aeronautics and Astronautics Region II Student Conference in April. It was a lot
                        of fun to see what other engineering students were working on and to be able to tell
                        others about the work we have been doing. Also, we took home first place in our category,
                        which was very satisfying to say the least."
                     
                     
                     The research paper that Parker, Pumroy and Williams won the award for beat teams from
                        14 campuses throughout the Southeast, including the University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt
                        University, Georgia Tech, University of Florida and University of Alabama. The UofM
                        team was awarded cash prizes and advance to the AIAA Foundation International Student
                        Conference, which will be held in San Diego next January.
                     
                     
                     Physics graduate student Andrew Brock has also been a member of the UofM's research
