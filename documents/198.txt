                        performers with big ambitions find a rich, diverse experience through our Helen Hardin Honors Program . We   combine the best of a small liberal arts school with the wide-ranging opportunities
                        of a large, nationally recognized research university. While all of the 1,300 honors
                        students excel academically, they also are part of a dynamic and diverse student body
                        of more than 20,000 students. The program has produced Goldwater Scholars, Truman
                        Scholars and Fulbright Scholars. Many departments within specific academic programs
                        offer their own honors programs, so there are many ways for students to graduate with
                        honors. The UofM also has a well thought of Emerging Leaders Program where students get real world experience to become tomorrow's leaders.
