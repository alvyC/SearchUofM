                     The online Master of Science degree in Educational Psychology at the University of
                        Memphis prepares educational leaders for teaching, basic and applied research or other
                        career/professional roles that require an in-depth understanding of human development,
                        learning and cognition, and research and statistics. Designed to meet the needs of
                        professionals and individuals who want/need a graduate degree but cannot attend traditional
                        classes at the university, our online courses will allow you to complete your courses
                        and ultimately earn your Masters degree while accommodating your busy schedules.
                     
                     
                     Our graduate students come from a variety of backgrounds, with a variety of interests
                        and career goals. While many of our students are teachers or prospective teachers,
                        others are school psychologists, school administrators, military personnel, health
                        professionals, ministers, law enforcement officers, social workers, consultants, and
                        people from the business community. Their undergraduate degrees are as varied as their
                        backgrounds. What is common is that our students all share a commitment to research
                        and apply current educational and psychological research to understand and solve contemporary
                        social and educational problems.
