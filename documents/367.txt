                           in the Workplace All organizations – from large and small businesses to healthcare providers, academic
                        institutions, government agencies and civil society – can experience data breaches
                        or be targets of cybercrime, which can result in stolen intellectual property, theft
                        of personal information or – if our critical infrastructure is attacked – a disruption
                        to our way of life.

                        do we create a culture of cybersecurity in the workplace throughout the organization?
                        What roles does leadership play in ensuring that cybersecurity is a priority and the
                        organization is taking a strong cybersecurity posture? What is being done to generate
                        awareness, educate and train employees? What is the individual employee's responsibility
                        regarding cybersecurity? How do we ensure that employees view cybersecurity from a
                        risk-based perspective? • Moderator: Michael Kaiser, Executive Director, National Cyber Security Alliance • Denise Wood, FedEx VP of Information Security and Corporate Systems • Chris Inglis, FedEx Board Member • Klint Walker, DHS Cyber Security Advisor • Senior Special Agent Matthew Stephenson, United States Secret Service
