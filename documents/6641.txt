                        Research Interests:
                        
                        My research spans organismal biology and physiology, with an emphasis on biological
                           rhythms, reproductive neuroendocrinology and seasonality. I currently investigate
                           the neural mechanisms that regulate seasonal cycles of reproduction in mammals, with
                           concentration on the pineal hormone melatonin. Synchronization of reproductive effort
                           with the external environment is crucial for successful reproduction in temperate
                           zone mammals; many species track changes in day length to time reproduction.
                        
                        
                        Exposure to long day lengths stimulate the reproductive system whereas short day lengths
                           in autumn causes involution of the reproductive system within 6 weeks; this inhibition
                           wanes after 20 weeks and the gonads spontaneously revert to the spring reproductive
                           phenotype in mid-winter, well in advance of the long day lengths of spring. The waning
                           of short-day inhibition of reproduction is thought to reflect development of refractoriness
                           of the neuroendocrine axis to short days and the pineal melatonin signals that transduce
                           effects of day length on the reproductive system.
                        
                        
                        The refractory state is reversed by exposure to many weeks of long, summer-like, day
                           lengths. With the exception of inhibition by short day lengths, little is known regarding
                           the neural melatonin target tissues that subserve the various phases of the seasonal
                           reproductive cycle. Melatonin acts at several neural sites to inhibit gonadotropin
                           secretion. Little is known about the relationships among the various structures in
                           the melatonin "pathway".
                        
                        
                        My research established that refractoriness to melatonin occurs independently at multiple
                           brain sites in Siberian hamsters. This suggests that melatonin-sensitive neural circuits
                           may permit independent control of the several individual photoperiod traits such as
                           mating behavior, food intake, body weight regulation, immune function and prolactin
                           secretion. I plan to investigate this question using various neuroendocrine, behavioral
                           and physiological approaches.
                        
                        
                        A hamsters' response to a particular day length depends on whether the current day
                           length is longer or shorter than those that preceded it; this has been termed the
                           "photoperiod history effect". For example, an intermediate day length of 13 hours
                           of light per day elicits either gonadal growth or regression depending on whether
                           the animal was previously exposed to shorter or longer day lengths, respectively.
                           The sites and mechanisms by which melatonin forms photoperiod "memories" or where
                           these memories are stored remain largely uncharacterized. Recent results from my laboratory
                           identify the specific neural tissues that are involved in the formation of a photoperiod
                           history.
