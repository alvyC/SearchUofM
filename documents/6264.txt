                        Dr. Sanjay Mishra joined the Department of Physics at the University of Memphis in 1999. He has been consistently productive in research, instruction, and service
                           to the University of Memphis (UoM) since 1999. Dr. Mishra initiated an active multidisciplinary
                           research program in materials science at the UoM.
                        
                        
                        Before receiving postdoctoral experience from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,
                           the University of California-Berkeley at the Advanced Light Source Synchrotron Facility,
                           he received his Ph.D in Physics from the University of Missouri-Rolla, MO, MS from
                           Pittsburg State University, Pittsburg, KS, MSc. from the South Gujarat University,
                           Surat, India and Post Graduate Diploma in Space Sciences from Gujarat University,
                           Ahmedabad, India.
                        
                        
                        Dr. Mishra's research work focuses on magnetic nanomaterials and nanocomposites (exchange
                           biased and exchange spring-nanocomposites), magnetic nanocomposites for drug delivery,
                           carbon nanospheres as template for the growth of nanostructures, nanorods for microwave
                           devices, hard coating materials, bioimplantable polymers, and solar energy related
                           materials.
