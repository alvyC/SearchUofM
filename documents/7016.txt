                        Tardiness and unexcused absence from class are unprofessional behaviors which should
                           be avoided, but attendance will not be graded.
                        
                        
                        Electronic devices such as cell phones and pagers should be turned off in the classroom.
                        
                        Reasonable and appropriate accommodations will be made for students who present a
