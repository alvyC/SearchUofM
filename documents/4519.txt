                     Dear Campus Community:
                     
                     The 109th Tennessee General Assembly is considering legislation that will permit full-time
                        employees of the University of Memphis and other public colleges and universities
                        to carry handguns on our campuses if the employee has a valid Tennessee handgun carry
                        permit. We oppose this legislation and do not believe the presence of more weapons
                        will make our campuses safer.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis has consistently been one of the safest places in the state.
                        We believe our exemplary safety record is due in part to guns being prohibited on
                        our campuses. Additionally,
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        More weapons on campus may result in more frequent emergency alerts and possible lockdowns,
                           which will disrupt our academic mission and will adversely impact student success.
                        
                        
                        Unlike police officers, handgun carry permit holders are not trained to respond to
                           stressful events or to mitigate violent situations, which could lead to catastrophic
                           consequences.
                        
                        
                        In an incident of possible mass violence, every second is critical. Encountering armed
                           people will delay police officers from responding to threats. Each armed person and
                           weapon will have to be secured before officers can move forward. The current national
                           law enforcement model directs officers to respond and engage any threats as quickly
                           as possible.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     While acts of mass violence are rare on college campuses, we recognize our responsibility
                        to prepare for a number of crises. In addition to having our own well-trained and
                        adequately equipped police department that can respond quickly, the UofM has a multi-hazard
                        emergency response plan, conducts regular training exercises for emergency events,
                        and has an overlapping emergency notification system. This semester, we conducted
                        seminars to inform our community on how to remain safe during crisis events, which
                        included Be TigerREADY resources.
                     
                     
                     In closing, we oppose additional weapons on campus except those carried by highly-trained
                        police officers. To help us keep our campuses safe, we urge the legislature to retain
                        the existing laws that prohibit weapons on our campuses.
