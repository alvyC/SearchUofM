                     General Chemistry I--CHEM 1110
                     
                     This course is required for Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, and Dietetics majors,
                        and will also be taken by students preparing for medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and
                        related health professions. These students will also take the associated laboratory,
                        CHEM 1111. CHEM 1110 and 1111 together (4 credit hours) satisfy a General Education
                        Natural Science requirement.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: Students with an AP score of 4 or 5 may obtain credit for CHEM 1110 and 1111.
                     
                     Prerequisites: high school chemistry or CHEM 1010, and MATH 1710 or MATH 1730 (or equivalent) with
                        at least C-, or score on math placement exam (ALEKS) earning placement into MATH 1830
                        or higher. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll concurrently in the associated laboratory,
                        CHEM 1111.  The course builds very quickly upon high school chemistry, so students
                        whose high school background is weak are advised to take CHEM 1010 first.
                     
                     
                     Recommended Corequisite: CHEM 1111 Note: Separate grades are assigned for lecture (1110) and laboratory (1111).
                     
                     
                     Course Description: Laws of chemistry; periodic table and chemical periodicity; stoichiometry, nomenclature.
