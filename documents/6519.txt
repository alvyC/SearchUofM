                        the next. The amulet featured is in the collection of the Institute of Egyptian Art

                     The Institute of Egyptian Art & Archaeology at the University of Memphis will host
                        the thirteenth annual Legacy of Egypt Lecture on Tuesday, March 15th, at the Michael
                        D. Rose Theater, room 115. Dr. Steve Vinson of Indiana University, Bloomington, will
                        present at 7:00 p.m. A reception will precede the lecture, at 6:15 p.m. Both events
                        are free and open to the public. Pay parking is available in the Zach Curlin garage
                        adjacent to the University Center. Dr. Vinson is an associate professor of Egyptology at Indiana University, Bloomington.
                        Originally trained in anthropology and nautical archaeology, Dr. Vinson has often
                        written about Egyptian boats, ships, nautical transportation and trade. More recently,
                        he has turned his attention to Egyptian literature, particularly the literature of
                        the Greek and Roman periods. He is currently completing a book on historical and narrative
                        approaches to the 'First Tale of Setne Khaemwas.' Dr. Vinson will be speaking on the reception, by African-American authors in the Twentieth
                        Century, of an ancient Egyptian "ghost story," known as the 'First Tale of Setne Khaemwas'.
                        The sensational, and even lurid, subject matter of the ancient Setne story became
                        enmeshed with modern popular culture through its influence on the Victorian-era fiction
                        of H. Rider Haggard and the 1932 Universal film "The Mummy." Less well known, however,
                        is the influence of the Setne legend on African-American literature, including works
                        by Harlem Renaissance author Zora Neale Hurston and MacArthur Foundation fellow, Ishmael
                        Reed. Through these authors' works, the tale of Setne became intertwined with the
                        legend of Moses. This new and evolving narrative was informed by a broad understanding
                        of ancient Egypt's past that was current in the early and mid-Twentieth Century. At
                        the same time, it addressed concerns that were of special relevance to the African-American
                        community, including the long-standing image of Moses as a liberator; pan-Africanism;
                        a more specific "Egyptocentrism"; and, particularly in the case of Ishmael Reed, writing
                        in the 1970s, of black liberation.

                     Lawrence Matthews III: The Marketing of Perception
                     
                     February 15 â€“ March 4, 2016
                     
                     Opening Reception: Friday, February 19, 2016 Â 5-8 PM
                     
                     The exhibition Lawrence Matthews III: The Marketing of Perception features Matthews' recent work exploring issues of race, image, and appropriation.
                        Derived from cigarette and alcohol advertisements in issues of Ebony magazine from
                        the 1960s and '70s, the artist's vibrant photographs of African-American men and women,
                        featured out of their original context, provoke questions of image making on both
                        literal and figurative levels. Stemming from Matthews' recent foray into photography,
                        the exhibition also includes the artist's trademark video installations comprised
                        of analog televisions playing commercials from the period.
                     
                     
                     On his subject matter, Matthews recalls, "In college, I began to collect copies of
                        Ebony from the 1960s and 70s. I was amazed by the progressiveness of the articles,
                        as well as the beautiful photography in the ads. They portrayed Black people as intelligent
                        and successful members of society. However, I began to notice nearly all of these
                        ads where for liquor and cigarettes. Brands I'd known as stereotypically "Black" such
                        as Newport, Seagrams, Hennessy, and Salem were repeated throughout the pages. I started
                        to wonder why products known to be harmful were featured so prominently in a magazine
                        existing to uplift Black Americans."
                     
                     
                     Matthews' close zoom brings to the forefront products once subtly placed in everyday
                        scenes while his deliberate cropping removes the ad copy that once surrounded these
                        images. His photographs take on new meaning as standalone images of cool, sexy, powerful,
                        and respectable individuals, yet under their veneer, also allude to a contentious,
                        racialized history of corporate power and blighted communities.
                     
                     
                     Lawrence Matthews III was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1991. His work ranges from
                        painting, collage, photography, and ready-made sculpture, to music and film. In 2014,
                        Matthews received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Memphis.
                        His work has been included in multiple solo and group exhibitions around the mid-south
                        including Caritas Village, Circuitous Succession Gallery, David Lusk Gallery, and
                        Crosstown Arts, among others. He has received numerous grants and awards including
                        Best of Show at The University of Memphis' 31st Annual Juried Student Exhibition in 2014, the Dean's Creative Achievement Award and Department of Art Creative Achievement
                        Award in 2015.
