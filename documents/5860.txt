                     About ArtLab: The Experimental Art Space
                     
                     Artists may now submit for the Spring 2016 ArtLab award appointment.   The submission
                        deadline is 5pm, December 5th, 2014. The winning proposal receives an honorarium of
                        $250, museum sponsored online publicity on AMUM's .edu website and our social media
                        presences (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Vimeo). Your ArtLab opening reception will
                        share the larger reception of AMUM's new exhibition opening, which will add to the
                        abundance of viewers who will see your work in addition to the viewers you bring in
                        through your own publicity and the aforementioned publicity offered by AMUM's Media
                        Specialist. However, the highest incentive is the opportunity, for emerging and established
                        artists alike, to showcase your most experimental artwork installation within a dedicated
                        museum space. ArtLab offers all the benefits of exhibiting within a museum environment,
                        which includes track lighting options, multiple electrical outlets, and a protected
                        camera surveilled setting. Your work will be secure within the safe climate controlled
                        museum as priceless artifacts and contemporary exhibitions.   ArtLab Space Dimensions:
                        485 square ft, 87 running ft, and 10 ft ceiling.
                     
                     
                     ArtLab is intended to be a space for new, experimental, unreviewed, non-mainstream,
                        and otherwise under-represented work that demonstrates the potential to broaden boundaries
                        for the understanding of expression and ideas. Download the prospectus below, and
                        please note that artists who exceed the minimal requirements of the prospectus will
                        fair better than artists with proposals that are too vague.) Please note that travel
                        and shipping expenses are not covered by the museum and are the responsibility of
                        the exhibiting ArtLab artist. Therefore, while this call is open to all artists, nevertheless,
                        it is necessary for the artist to deliver and install his/ her own work or have an
                        appointed installer or representative who can install your work to your specifications.
                        The Museum Media Specialist will assist in the installation, but the artist should
                        be involved physically as well as through blueprint. In short, it is advantageous
                        to local artists to apply, and yet any artists with the energy and ambition to make
                        it happen is eligible. HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR WORK  (By mail or in person by dropping off to the front desk at
                        AMUM with the following labeling.)
