                     These events will consider the meaning and impact of Hurricane Katrina. They are organized
                        in conjunction with Memphis Reads, whose 2016 book selection,  Salvage the Bones by Jesmyn Ward, focuses on the days before the storm hit in a poor, rural African
                        American community on the Mississippi gulf coast.
