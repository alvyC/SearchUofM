                        About Dr. Nelson 
                        
                        Dr. Steven L. Nelson is a first-year professor in the Leadership Department at the
                           University of Memphis. He joins the faculty after serving one year at the University
                           of New Orleans. Dr. Nelson holds a Ph.D. in Educational Leadership from the Pennsylvania
                           State University. He also holds a J.D. from the University Of Iowa College of Law
                           as well as a M.A.T. from Xavier University of Louisiana. His undergraduate background
                           is in Political Science from the Louisiana State University. Dr. Nelson joins the
                           faculty in the Leadership Department with a wide range of experiences. He taught in
                           the private and public (both traditional and charter) schools in the New Orleans area.
                           During his time as a high school teacher, Dr. Nelson rose to the level of teacher-leader
                           where he dispatched administrative duties that included curriculum design and alignment,
                           behavior intervention and classroom management support and instructional coaching.
                           Dr. Nelson joined the staff at the Southern Poverty Law Center's School-to-Prison
                           Pipeline Project in New Orleans after exiting the traditional role of an educator
                           in the school building. At SPLC, Dr. Nelson worked on charter school law and policy,
                           special education and juvenile justice advocacy and supported students, parents and
                           communities in accessing equitable educational opportunities.

                        Research Interests
                        
                        Dr. Nelson's research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of law, policy
                           and politics. He is particularly interested in how law, policy and politics advance
                           or retard efforts at achieving equity in educational systems. The focus of Dr. Nelson's
                           research is typically on school choice models. He has written and published numerous
                           pieces on school choice and educational equity. Dr. Nelson's work has been published
                           in various media including law reviews, education journals and books. Dr. Nelson is
                           an active member of the Education Law Association and frequently presents at national
                           conferences and symposia. Though research and teaching are large parts of his duties
                           at the University of Memphis, Dr. Nelson most enjoys the opportunity to mentor students
                           through the research and writing process. He often coauthors pieces with students.
                           Dr. Nelson also enjoys being mentored and actively seeks new professional and personal
                           mentors.

                        When not in his professional role, Dr. Nelson is active in the community. He is a
                           member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. He has held various appointed positions
                           in his chapter and seizes every opportunity to participate in the organization's Guide
                           Right activities. Dr. Nelson is a member of numerous book clubs, and is seeking to
                           start a critical race theory-based club in the Memphis area.
