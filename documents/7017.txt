                     Course Outline: This course focuses on medicinal chemistry and the underlying principles from organic
                        chemistry. Topics to be covered include drug discovery, lead modification, drug-receptor
                        interactions, enzymes, DNA structure and drug interactions, and drug metabolism.

                        time. At least one test will be administered in class and graded before the last day
                        to drop. Other tests, quizzes, and graded assignments, weighting, and grade ranges
                        are at the discretion of the instructor and will be detailed on a syllabus distributed

                        Tardiness and unexcused absence from class are unprofessional behaviors which should
                           be avoided, but attendance will not be graded.
                        
                        
                        Electronic devices such as cell phones and pagers should be turned off in the classroom.
