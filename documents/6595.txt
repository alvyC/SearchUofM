                           <h3>About Dr. Mandel</h3><p>Dr. Mandel joined the department in 2014. She received
                           a B.A. from Carson Newman University with a focus in organismal biology, ecology,
                           and natural history. Her Ph.D work involved plant conservation and evolutionary genetics
                           both in rare, endangered species as well as weedy, invasives. Following this, her
                           post-doctoral research at The University of Georgia was aimed at identifying the genetic
                           basis of evolutionary and agronomically important traits in cultivated sunflower.
                           Her research at the UofM includes plant population and quantitative genetics, evolutionary
                           genetics, and phylogenetics. She employs field, laboratory, and greenhouse approaches
                           to gain an understanding of the processes and mechanisms that lead to the genetic,
                           phenotypic, and ecological diversity we see in the world. Courses taught include Ecological
                           Genetics 7795/8705 and Plant Ecology 4053/6053.</p><h3>Research Interests</h3><ul><li>Plant
