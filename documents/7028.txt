                     What kind of work do Planners do?
                     
                     The kind of work a planner does depends on his/her workplace setting and whether he/she
                        has a particular specialization.
                     
                     
                     Land Use planning is the most traditional venue for planning practice. Some land use
                        planners work on long-range comprehensive plans, developing policies to help communities
                        achieve a future vision. Others develop and implement land use controls, such as zoning
                        regulations, to guide development in the short-term.
                     
                     
                     Environmental planners work to manage and protect natural resources. They measure
                        the impacts of development on the community's physical environment, and develop policies
                        to mitigate negative impacts.
                     
                     
                     Transportation planners develop infrastructure to efficiently move people and goods
                        within and between communities. Because of the link between transportation networks
                        and development patterns, there is a great deal of overlap between transportation
                        planning and land use planning.
                     
                     
                     Neighborhood planners work to preserve or revitalize neighborhoods and provide a foundation
                        for positive social change. Neighborhood planners commonly work with citizen groups
                        and community development corporations – non-profit agencies that coordinate neighborhood-based
                        housing and community development programs.
                     
                     
                     Economic development planners analyze the strengths and weaknesses of local economies.
                        They develop policies and programs to improve the economic well-being of community
                        residents. Others planning specializations include, growth management, capital facilities
                        planning, housing, and historic preservation.
                     
                     
                     Many planners are generalists, with a broad range of knowledge about the impacts of
                        physical development. Good planning involves a great deal of coordination among experts
                        from various fields and agencies. Generalist planners help to facilitate this coordination.
