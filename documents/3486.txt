                     Admission to Non-Degree Status
                     
                     Graduate Non-Degree: This classification is for domestic students who wish to enroll in graduate courses
                        but who do not wish to pursue a graduate degree at the University or whose applications
                        are incomplete. Graduate non-degree applicants must show proof of having earned a
                        baccalaureate degree at the time of application. At the end of the first semester
                        of course work, the Graduate Non-Degree student may be required to furnish an official
                        transcript showing at minimum a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university.
                     
                     
                     Academic units may restrict non-degree students to designated courses. Graduate Non-Degree
                        students who decide to matriculate for a degree must make application to the Graduate
                        School and must meet all admissions requirements. Master's students in programs requiring
                        36 credit hours or fewer are limited to 12 credit hours while in non-degree status.
                        Students in degree programs requiring more than 36 hours must take at least 2/3 of
                        the credit hours after acceptance into the program. Students should note that some
                        academic units count coursework toward a degree only after admission or have more
                        restrictive policies regarding the number of non-degree hours that count toward the
                        degree.
                     
                     
                     Before registering for a second semester of graduate level coursework, the non-degree
                        student is required to sign a release agreeing that additional coursework will not
                        apply to degree programs.
                     
                     
                     Non-degree students must maintain a 3.00 GPA in graduate courses in order to re-enroll
                        and are not eligible for graduate assistantships.
