                     WHAT is SI? SI is a series of weekly review sessions for students who are taking a difficult course.
                        Students benefit greatly from the time spent with Supplemental Instruction. Research
                        shows that students who take advantage of services like Supplemental Instruction,
                        six or more times, experience a significantly higher positive impact on their grades
                        than students who utilized the services fewer than six times or did not use the services
                        at all.
                     
                     
                     WHO should attend? Students who want to improve their understanding of the course material, and/or want
                        to develop strategies for learning the course concepts and self-test their understanding
                        of the concepts.
                     
                     
                     WHO leads the sessions? SI Leaders have completed the course successfully. SI Leaders know the course content.
                        SI Leaders read all the material, prepare to lead the study session, and provide study
                        strategies appropriate for the course material. Your SI Leader will help you to learn
                        how to think about the content of the lectures.
                     
                     
                     WHEN will the SI sessions be offered? Surveys will be given during the first week. SI surveys, distributed during the first
                        week of class, will list a variety of times when SI sessions can be available. SI
                        study session schedules will then be provided in class. SI study sessions will start
                        the second week of classes.
                     
                     
                     WHERE will the SI sessions meet? SI study sessions will meet in the building where your class meets.
