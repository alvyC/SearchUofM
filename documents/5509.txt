                     Reading Education is concerned with the promotion of literacy, with specific emphasis
                        on reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Urban literacy issues and research pertaining
                        to children living at the poverty level are of particular interest to many of our
                        reading education faculty. The program of study is designed around the International Reading Association (IRA)/ National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) standards that deal with what reading professionals need to know and what
                        they are able to do. These standards emphasize reflective professionals who have proficiency
                        in three broad categories: (1) knowledge and beliefs about reading, (2) instruction
                        and assessment, and (3) organizing and enhancing a reading program.

                        professional needs.  Our reading graduates are teaching in major school districts,
                        comprehensive universities or college-level remedial/developmental reading programs,
                        serving as clinical supervisors, literacy coaches and/or as reading/language arts
                        supervisors.
                     
                     
                     Our faculty has been influential in setting the national agenda of improving the success
                        of children living in poverty through research, school and district-wide interventions,
                        consulting, and authoring textbooks for pre-service and in-service teachers. Currently,
                        the faculty has been improving instruction in urban schools through projects like
                        the award-winning Memphis Literacy Academy and the federally-funded Memphis Striving Readers Project , as well as working with other school districts across the nation. Books authored
                        by our faculty, such as Technology to Teach Literacy:  A Resource for K-8 Teachers , Teaching Children to Read: The Teacher Makes the Difference , and the Cooter/Flynt/Cooter Comprehensive Reading Inventory:  Measuring Reading Development
                           in Regular and Special Education Classrooms are helping teachers succeed.  The Reading faculty is widely published in a variety
                        of scholarly journals such as: Curriculum Inquiry, Journal of Adolescent and Adult
                        Literacy, Journal of Latinos in Education, and The Reading Teacher.
