                     With the diffusion of cloud services, they are becoming an alternative to traditional
                        information technology (IT). Despite the importance of cloud services, relatively
                        few studies have been devoted to an empirical examination of the switching behavior
                        from traditional IT to cloud services at the individual level. Therefore, this study
                        attempts to explore the switching factors (i.e. switching enablers and switching inhibitors)
                        and to empirically examine the relationships between those and users' intention to
                        switch to cloud services, based on the two-factor theoretic perspective. This study
                        uses a longitudinal design to get survey data from undergraduate students at two universities
                        in Korea in the context of IT switching to Google Apps settings. According to our
                        findings, this study found that users' switching intention to cloud services was not
                        only positively influenced by expected switching benefits whose antecedents are omnipresence
                        of cloud services and collaboration support, but also negatively influenced by expected
                        switching costs whose antecedents are satisfaction with incumbent IT and breath use
                        of inclement IT. The impacts of switching benefits and costs on switching intention
                        were also positively moderated by end users' personal innovativeness.
