                        one that will have significant impact on the future of the University of Memphis.
                        As you know, Governor Haslam has filed legislation that would provide for an autonomous
                        governing board for the U of M. I am forwarding a copy of the proposed legislation
                        to all chairs, deans and the Faculty Senate. Provost Weddle-West will coordinate with

                        taskforce targeting a range of issues related to the eventual transition. The hope
                        is to have our own governing board in place for April 2017. In addition to the autonomous
                        governing board legislation, we also have requested $31M for the Memphis Research
                        Consortium, $2M for our Lambuth Campus, renewal of funding for our Center for Earthquake
                        Research and Information (CERI), along with line item funding for Chucalissa.
                     
                     
                     Let me express my gratitude for the exceptional work of our enrollment management
                        group. For the first time in many years, our spring enrollment has grown. We ordinarily
                        experience a 2-3% contraction secondary to graduation. Given our increase in graduation
                        numbers, coupled with several years of smaller freshmen enrollment, these numbers
                        are encouraging. Here's a quick summary of spring enrollment numbers compared to last
                        year (on the same date, not all categories included):

                        the significant level of activity this semester, I'll continue to forward updates
