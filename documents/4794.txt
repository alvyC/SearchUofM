		Wrong Number on the Internet

		ITS has received several misdirected calls from students and others who are trying to reach the Bursar’s Office .  There appears to be an incorrect listing somewhere on the Web (not on www.memphis.edu ), as most callers say that they Googled UoM bursar, and got the ITS number.
For your convenience the Bursar’s Office number is 678-5579.
