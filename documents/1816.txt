                     FedEx Institute of Technology Collaborates With Community Partners To Advance Technology
                        Skills and Competencies
                     
                     
                     April 20, 2016 - The University of Memphis, through the FedEx Institute of Technology,
                        shares a goal with several community organizations in seeking to advance technological
                        skills and competencies. This common goal will encourage technology businesses to
                        locate in the region. The FedEx Institute of Technology is partnering with two regional
                        non-profit professional organizations also dedicated to this goal.
                     
                     
                     Tech901 is a non-profit organization with a charter to train current or potential
                        Memphians for a variety of information technology jobs, and to work with employers
                        to increase the technology job base in Memphis. The Memphis Technology Foundation
                        is a group of professionals in Memphis with a strong interest in staying at the cutting
                        edge of emerging technology. They are user group leaders and participants interested
                        in learning and growing the community from a technology perspective. A celebration
                        of these partnerships is planned for Monday, April 25, at 4 p.m. at the FedEx Institute
                        of Technology Fishbowl.
                     
                     
                     Some key elements of these partnerships include:
                     
                     The FedEx Institute of Technology will partner with Tech901 to offer A++ and Comp
                        TIA industry certifications both to UofM undergraduates and local high school students
                        in efforts to increase the regional pool of technology talent. These industry certifications
                        will also help increase the pool of students who can move on to further their education
                        in the technology academic programs at the University of Memphis.
                     
                     
                     The FedEx Institute of Technology will partner with the Memphis Technology Foundation
                        to offer monthly user group meetings of technology professionals focusing on the latest
                        concepts and developments in cutting-edge areas such as machine learning, Python programming,
                        R programming, computer game development and other emerging technologies.
                     
                     
                     The FedEx Institute of Technology also looks to partner with other local technology
                        organizations invested in the growth of technology talent, workforce and innovation
                        for Memphis and the Mid-South.
                     
                     
                     UofM President M. David Rudd said, "We need to signal to the world that innovative
                        technology ideas are constantly being pioneered in Memphis in order for us to attract
                        advanced technology businesses to the region. Such efforts also help our local employers
                        such as FedEx, International Paper, AutoZone, Medtronic and others attract and keep
                        the best technology talent in Memphis."
                     
                     
                     Community partnerships are a critical element in positioning the FedEx Institute of
                        Technology as a hub for technology research and development. The Institute is an advanced
                        technology and research organization that serves as the front door to the research
                        infrastructure and innovation capabilities of the University of Memphis. It functions
                        as a catalyst for interdisciplinary research and innovation in emerging technologies
                        by supporting cross-campus research innovation clusters. The Institute is also home
                        to the University's intellectual property and patent repository that is the focal
                        point of technology transfer and licensing operations. The Institute enjoys a unique
                        innovation partnership with FedEx, which sponsors the Institute for advanced research
                        purposes. The Institute is the central hub for efforts to maintain a cutting-edge
                        innovative environment in the Mid-South.
