                     Anthropology: studying people and culture; applying knowledge to real world issues
                     
                     Anthropology is the study of humankind. Anthropologists employ prehistoric, historic,
                        and contemporary perspectives to explore the culture, evolution, behavior, beliefs
                        and social organization of peoples around the world. The discipline offers a comparative
                        understanding of lifeways around the planet and seeks strategies for improving humans'
                        quality of life in a global context.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in Anthropology.
                        Students with diverse interests will find anthropology to be a stimulating major or
                        minor. Anthropology courses also provide the perfect elective for students in other
                        fields, such as international business, economics, sociology, communication, history,
