                        About Michael O'Nele
                        
                        Michael joined the design faculty of the Department of Theatre & Dance at University
                           of Memphis in the Fall of 1998. Michael believes that the art of technical direction
                           is to transform imagination into reality. Technology is pushing its way into the world
                           of art, and we can either choose to embrace it or hope that it is a trend and will
                           go away. Michael chooses to embrace technology because it provides theatre with new
                           means of expression. At the simplest level, computers allow for the efficient and
                           easy manipulation and presentation of images, text, and ideas. The impact that technology
                           may have in the future is something that students must be prepared for; as an artistic
                           tool theatre artists are only now scratching the surface of what will come. In order
                           for students to compete in a future workforce, Michael's goal for each class and project
                           is to lay the ground work for technological skill development that will make them
                           competitive.
