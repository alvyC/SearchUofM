                        we will exceed that for the 2016-2017 academic year. This year's freshman class will
                        likely set a record. Last Friday we had over 2,700 new freshman enrolled, an increase
                        of 30% over last year's class. As students settle in during the first week, we expect
                        the final number to be somewhere between 25% -30% year over year growth, a record
                        for the University of Memphis. Similarly, growth in total new students (i.e. transfers
                        + freshman) will approach 4000, the largest we have seen in quite a while. As of today,
                        the growth in total new students is 24% over last year. Overall growth of 2-3% is
                        particularly impressive given our significant improvement in graduation numbers over
                        the past three years. As shared previously, we graduated over 800 students more in
                        the past three years relative to the previous three year average, with marked improvement
                        in our overall graduation rate. Of particular importance, our new incoming students
                        are the most academically qualified to date, both with respect to mean ACT scores
                        and high school GPA.
                     
                     
                     I wish you the best for the new academic year and want to say thank you for your hard
                        work and dedication to our students, our campus community and the City of Memphis.
                        Go Tigers!
