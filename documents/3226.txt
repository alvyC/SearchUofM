                                 Sexual assault and rape is on the rise on college campuses. Studies show that at least
                                    1 in 4 college women will be the victim of a sexual assault during her academic career.
                                    At least 80% of all sexual assaults are committed by an acquaintance of the victim.
                                    The Counseling Center provides support to students who experience this type of violence.
