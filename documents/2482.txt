                     Focus Area on Modern European History
                     
                     Europe has played a central role in shaping the world in which we live, and European
                        historiography continues to influence how professional historians approach the study
                        of the past. Our European program emphasizes the social and cultural history of the
                        modern era and considers Europe in a global context. We also offer a wide variety
                        of courses on the medieval and early modern periods. The diverse research and teaching
                        interests of the faculty range across ever-changing political boundaries and include
                        the following: state and society; religion; art and politics; enlightenment and revolution;
                        industrialization; nations and nationalism; imperialism; racism and antisemitism;
                        gender and family; leisure and consumption; war and genocide.
                     
                     
                     Our three modern European historians focus on questions of state and society, nations
                        and nationalism, and race and empire. Trained as a cultural historian of France, Andrew
                        Daily’s research and teaching focus on the colonial and post-colonial history of modern
                        Europe. His current research explores the cultural and intellectual history of French
                        citizens from the Caribbean, arguing that their experiences provide a privileged lens
                        for viewing France’s transformation from a colonial to a postcolonial state. Daniel
                        Unowsky’s research and teaching grapple with the tension between national and dynastic
                        loyalties in Habsburg central Europe. His current work considers local incidents of
                        antisemitic violence in the context of the arrival of mass politics in rural regions
                        in what is now southern Poland. Andrei Znamenski’s research has focused on Russian
                        and Soviet history, and more broadly, on state, society, and religion in northern
                        Eurasia. Among particular topics he explores are indigenous populations and religions
                        of Inner Asia, Siberia and Alaska, history of modern esotericism, and the rise of
                        modern state.
                     
                     
                     Our European program offers a strong background in medieval, renaissance, and early
                        modern history. James Blythe has written several books on medieval and renaissance
                        intellectual history. His work has explored European political thought, millennial
                        movements, religion, and gender. Courtney Luckhardt writes and teaches on medieval
                        cultural and religious history. Her work offers new insights into life in the early
                        Middle Ages and Late Antiquity through the study of travel and communication across
                        the continent. She uses hagiographical sources, material culture, and GIS technology
                        to understand the role that religious travel played in the diffusion of ideas, objects,
                        and people. Walter R. Brown is a scholar of early modern Europe, with special emphasis
                        on French and English cultural, social, and political history. His research focuses
                        on material life as seen through the fine and decorative arts.
