                     Lots of online degree programs mean lots of online courses. Degrees and transcripts
                        for online programs are identical in substance and appearance to those earned by on-ground
                        students, and online degrees course content is equivalent to on-campus courses. You
                        can complete a degree program completely online or you can combine online classes
                        with on-campus classes to complete your academic requirements.
