		Techqual+ Survey – We Need Your Input

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
Information Technology Services (ITS) is participating in the annual Techqual+ survey to assess the quality of technology services on campus,  and we need your help.  Your input is critical in helping us to gather information so that we can identify and plan appropriately to provide the best technology services possible.
Participants may enter a drawing for a $50 gift card.  Four winners will be selected!
Your participation in this survey is completely optional and your responses are anonymous. No personally identifiable information about you will be collected during the survey.  You will be given an opportunity to participate in this year’s gift card drawing at the end of the survey and, if you choose to participate, you will be redirected to a separate website to provide your email address.  The email address you provide for the gift card drawing will not be associated with your survey responses.  Gift card winners employed by the University of Memphis are subject to appropriate IRS tax withholding and reporting.
To participate in the survey, click the following link:
https://survey.techqual.org/dl.aspx?g=e9ea1b17-217e-4511-b0bf-12c0f42957e2
Your feedback is important because it helps us develop action plans that assist in continual improvement. The survey closes May 9, 2014 at 4:30 p.m.  I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to participate in this process. If you have any questions about the survey please feel free to contact me.
Regards,
Ellen

		The Heartbleed Bug

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		Dear Colleagues,
The Heartbleed Bug is a vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. This weakness allows stealing of the information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS encryption used to secure the Internet which can include the names, passwords, and actual content of secure information.
​As of April 10, 2014, all ITS managed services have been patched to mitigate this threat.  Additionally, our campus intrusion prevention and detection system has been updated to block external attempts from malicious actors.  After review, we do not believe there is any need to change your UofM campus UUID password at this time.
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Help Desk 24/7 at 678-8888.
Thank you,
Ellen
