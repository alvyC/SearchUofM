                    The National African American Photographic Archive (NAAPA) project is a collaborative effort between the University Libraries, University of Memphis and Ampro Industries, Inc. of Memphis.  The aim of the project is to collect, scan, and make available to the public photographs and informative metadata illustrating the daily and work lives and social activities of African Americans.  Seeded with materials already owned by the Special Collections Department of the UM Libraries, the NAAPA project solicits the donation or loan of   significant materials, accompanied by background information (metadata) that will help us to index, describe, and arrange, and the searcher to find, photographic documentation of people, places, and events of importance to African American and American history and culture.  The National African American Photographic Archive is meant to grow and   evolve.  To make inquiries to the project administrator, click here .
