                     A native of Memphis, TN, Joy R. Stout began her post-secondary career at LeMoyne-Owen
                        College where she earned a BS Ed. Degree in Elementary Education. It was after working
                        in a summer jobs program for teens that she realized her passion for helping others.
                        After completing a summer job at Girls Incorporate, the Girls Club of Memphis hired
                        her as a full-time counselor in the Educational Talent Search Program. She continued
                        working with students at Shelby State Community College (now Southwest Tennessee Community
                        College). She went on to earn a MS Ed. degree in Counseling with an emphasis in Higher
                        Education from The University of Memphis.
                     
                     
                     In 1985, Stout joined the University of Memphis Academic Counseling Unit where she
                        advised college students before they entered a degree-granting college. In 2003 she
                        was named Director of Adult and Commuter Student Services. In this leadership capacity,
                        she oversees programs and services designed to enhance the educational experience
                        of commuter and adult students while attending the UofM. In January 2014, Stout and
                        other administrators opened the Veterans Resource Center after a student-conducted
                        survey revealed many veteran students were looking for a place where they could connect
                        with other veteran students and have a place to relax. Mrs. Joy R. Stout currently
                        serves as the Director of Adult and Commuter Student Services and the Veterans Resource
                        Center.
