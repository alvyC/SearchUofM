                        six full-time International MBA students per cohort! In addition to this generous
                        assistantship provided by Peer Power, you will also receive a full tuition-waiver
                        from the Fogelman College of Business and Economics.
                     
                     
                     If selected, you will serve as a mentor to other students. As a Peer Power Scholar,

                        management. Ultimately, you will act as a success coach and your primary goal will
