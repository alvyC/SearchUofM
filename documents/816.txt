                     Auditing a Class
                     
                     To audit a class that has a Standard grading mode (A+, A, A-, B+...F), follow these
                        steps:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Refer to the Undergraduate Catalog or Graduate Catalog for the appropriate audit policy.
                        
                        Register for the class. You will be registered in the class for Standard grading mode;
                           however, you will apply to have the grading mode changed to Audit. Note: If no seats are available in the course, you will first have to request that the
                           instructor or department issue you a permit to register for the class.
                        
                        Read the instructions for processing the Request Permission to Audit Class form and complete the "Student" portion (Part 1) of the form. Take the form to the
                           course instructor for approval.
                        
                        If the instructor agrees to allow you to audit the class, he or she will complete
                           and sign Part 2 of the form. Then take the form to the Department Chair for final
                           approval. Note: If the instructor declines to allow you to audit the course, you must decide whether
                           to drop it or keep it on your schedule with Standard grading mode. If you do not want
                           to take the class with Standard grading mode, then you should drop it.
                        
                        If the Department Chair approves the audit, he or she will sign and complete Part
                           3 of the form and either forward the completed form to the Registrar's Office, or
                           instruct you to deliver the form there.
                        
                        The Registrar then changes the grade mode to Audit for the approved course.
