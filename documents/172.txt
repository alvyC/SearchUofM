                     BCS Superintendent, Dr. Stephens, named TN Superintendent of the Year
                     
                     Dr. Stephens was chosen out of a group of eight Regional Superintendents of the Year;
                        he has been the superintendent of Bartlett City Schools since its creation in 2014.
                     
                     
                     "We are very proud of David for winning the State Superintendent of the Year Award,"
                        Tennessee Organization of School Superintendents Executive Director Wayne Miller said.
                        "The work that he has done has been exemplary, especially given the fact that he created
                        the district from scratch just a short time ago.  David and his school and district
                        leaders are always very active in professional development.  Being recognized for
                        his good work comes as no surprise."
