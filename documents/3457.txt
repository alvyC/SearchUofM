                     Winterville Mounds
                     
                     Winterville, located on Highway 1 just north of Greenville Mississippi, is the location
                        of a prehistoric ceremonial center occupied from about A.D. 1000 to 1450. During the
                        height of the prehistoric occupation, Winterville contained at least 23 mounds that
                        served as a center for public activities of the surrounding community. The mounds
                        currently preserved at Winterville are some of the largest in the Southeast United
                        States. A museum at the site exhibits the material culture of the prehistoric Native
                        Americans who built the mounds and lived at the site.

                     Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians
                     
                     The Choctaw Indian Reservation comprising 35,000 acres of trust land scattered over
                        10 counties in east central Mississippi is home to nearly 10,000 members of Mississippi
                        Band of Choctaw Indians, descendants of the Choctaw who refused to be removed to Oklahoma
                        in the 1830s. The tribal headquarters, industrial park, Pearl River Resort, the Choctaw
                        Health Department/Center, and other main tribal services, are located in the Pearl
                        River Community in Neshoba County, Mississippi. The website of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma also contains important historical and cultural information about the
                        Choctaw people.
                     
                     
                     Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma
                     
                     The Chickasaw Nation's jurisdictional territory includes 7,648 square miles of south-central
                        Oklahoma and encompasses all or parts of 13 Oklahoma counties. Today there are nearly
                        50,000 members of the Chickasaw Nation. In the 1830s the United States Government
                        forced the Chickasaw people to leave their traditional homelands in what is now Mississippi,
                        Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee to their new homeland in south-central Oklahoma. With
                        the spirits of their ancestors the Chickasaw Nation today is "Unconquered and Unconquerable."
                        The Chickasaw Nation has five museums and historic buildings open to the public including a recently dedicated Chickasaw Culture Center in Sulphur, Oklahoma.

                        lived in four villages in an area where the Arkansas River met the Mississippi River.
                        In the 1800s the Quapaw were forced to relocate further west because of the expansion
                        of European-Americans.
