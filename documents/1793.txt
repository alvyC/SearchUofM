                     Top minds in mHealth offer research agenda to address privacy, security issues
                     
                     July 6, 2016 - The adoption of mobile health technology has the potential to provide
                        great benefits in terms of improved quality of healthcare, but is not without significant
                        privacy and security challenges, according to a paper by four thought leaders in the
                        field.
                     
                     
                     "Privacy and Security in Mobile Health: A Research Agenda," featured in the June edition
                        of Computer magazine, published by the IEEE Computer Society, examines the privacy
                        and security challenges inherent in mobile health (mHealth) technology.
                     
                     
                     The paper was co-authored by David Kotz of Dartmouth College, Carl A. Gunter of the
                        University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Santosh Kumar of the University of Memphis
                        and Jonathan P. Weiner of the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public
                        Health and School of Medicine. The IEEE Computer Society, with more than 60,000 members,
                        is the world's leading membership organization dedicated to computer science and technology.
                     
                     
                     The paper notes that mobile health (mHealth) technology can contribute to reduced
                        costs, better quality of health care, greater access to services, improved personal
                        wellness and public health.
                     
                     
                     "These benefits will be only achieved, however, if individuals are confident in the
                        privacy of their health-related information and if providers are confident in the
                        security and integrity of the data collected," the paper said.
                     
                     
                     Countries are increasingly looking to information technology and mobile technology
                        to address the challenges of managing chronic disease, which in the U.S. affects 45
                        percent of the population and accounts for 75 percent of the $2.6 trillion in U.S.
                        healthcare costs.
                     
                     
                     The paper identifies six recent trends that increase the challenges facing healthcare
                        IT systems:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        A shift in locus of care in the healthcare system.
                        
                        Strong economic incentives to keep patient populations healthy.
                        
                        Increasing adoption of mobile consumer devices such as smartphones and tablets.
                        
                        Significant emerging threats for healthcare IT systems along with new regulations
                           to protect medical integrity and patient privacy.
                        
                        
                        Rapid technological developments – the use of wearable sensors and the ability to
                           convert sensor data into measures of health and behavior.
                        
                        
                        A lack of expertise within healthcare organizations to secure patient data.
                        
                     
                     
                     The paper discusses each trend and identifies research challenges that should be undertaken
                        in order to address these challenges, an effort they hope fellow researchers will
                        join.
                     
                     
                     "We encourage colleagues with research expertise in mobile health, medical devices,
                        and secure computing to engage with these issues and help bring pervasive mobile-health
                        technology to the world," said Kotz.
                     
                     
                     Kumar noted the impact of such research will be broad. "Addressing safety and privacy
                        issues in mobile Health not only offers exciting research opportunities to make scientific
                        advances, but it also directly impacts human life by improving health and wellness,"
                        he said.
                     
                     
                     The authors note that traditional approaches to securing healthcare systems have relied
                        on isolating institutional systems with tools like firewalls and network access control,
                        but it has become difficult to "lock down" medical devices or records because patients
                        and staff now use the systems outside the traditional clinical environment. In addition,
                        many wellness applications now employed are completely mobile.
