                        UofM Research Foundation Receives Japanese Patent for Wound Care Dressing
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     
                     		
                     
                     
                     UofM Research Foundation Receives Japanese Patent for Wound Care Dressing
                     
                     June 8, 2016 - The University of Memphis Research Foundation (UMRF) has received a
                        Japanese patent for "Compositions and Methods for Delivering an Agent to a Wound."
                        The United States patent for the same invention was granted in 2015.
                     
                     
                     The patent issued last year was the 20th patent granted to UMRF. The biomedical technology
                        covered by the patent was invented in the University of Memphis Herff College Of Engineering's
                        Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME). The inventors are Dr. Warren Haggard and
                        Dr. Joel Bumgardner, both professors of BME, and Dr. Scott Noel of Bionova Medical,
                        who earned his PhD under Haggard's supervision.
                     
                     
                     The patent is exclusively licensed to Bionova Medical, a privately held medical device
                        company in Germantown, Tenn. The company's flagship product, Sentrex BioSponge MPD,
                        covered by this new patent, has received two clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug
                        Administration for use as a local wound management device that is also compatible
                        with Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT).
                     
                     
                     With funding support from the Military Infectious Diseases Research Program, Haggard
                        and Bumgardner are developing a next-generation wound dressing to prevent infection
                        and aid in wound healing for trauma patients. The current wound dressing is a naturally
                        sourced bio-compatible sponge material and is a commercially available product from
                        Bionova Medical. Haggard's team is investigating improved versions of the technology
                        with the added functionality to deliver both antibiotic and anti-fungal agents directly
                        to the wound. 
                     
                     
                     The commercialized sponge, Sentrex BioSponge™, was launched as a wound-dressing product
                        in August 2014. Its first use occurred at the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook
                        County (formerly Cook County Hospital) in Chicago. Since then it has been used in
                        more than 1,100 clinical trauma cases at facilities across the country, including
                        military treatment facilities. Used in combination with surgical debridement, irrigation
                        and systemic antibiotic regimens, the low-cost device is already improving treatment
                        outcomes for extremity fractures in civilian patients. With the improvements currently
                        in development, the next-generation sponge is expected to continue to reduce recovery
                        time and lower healthcare costs of these traumatic injuries. 
                     
                     
                     The Sentrex BioSponge MPD has been used in medical centers around the country to aid
                        in local management of a variety of wound types. Brian Austin, CEO of Bionova Medical,
                        said, "We appreciate the opportunity to provide physicians with a device utilizing
                        this novel technology from the University of Memphis that helps them manage complex
                        wounds."
                     
                     
                     Bionova, founded in 2011, is committed to providing advanced treatment options to
                        practicing physicians. Utilized across a spectrum of specialties, including trauma,
                        general and plastic surgery, and advanced wound care, Bionova Medical's versatile
                        device offers a simple solution for complex wounds.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis Research Foundation is a 501(c) corporation that supports
                        the research and technology transfer objectives of the UofM and its faculty and students.
