                        About Dr. Estrano
                        
                        Dr. Estrano joined the Department in 2003. During my postdocs I worked on gene expression
                           regulation and protein trafficking in two major parasites: Trypanosoma brucei causative
                           agent of Sleeping Sickness in the African and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
                           After joining the University of Memphis I continue my research in promoter regulation
                           in P. falciparum. My current focus is studying the molecular mechanisms underlying
                           the intestinal disturbances in Giardia lamblia infections. The intestinal disease
                           giardiasis is one of the most common parasitic infections worldwide affecting approximately
                           2.5 million humans every year, and has been included in the list of WHO Neglected
                           diseases since 2004. Giardiasis in humans is caused by Giardia lamblia belonging to
                           the Genus Giardia a group of binucleate, flagellated protozoan parasites which lack
                           common eukaryotic structures such as peroxisomes, a traditional Golgi apparatus and
                           typical mitochondria. In addition, I am also studying the bases for symptoms variability
                           and severity associated with this infection. Moreover, using an overexpression system
                           my laboratory is cloning and expressing human mitochondria and parasite genes in the
                           Giardia to understand the mechanism of mitosomal, a mitochondrial remnant, protein
                           import system. I am currently an Associate professor teaching Molecular Biology of
                           Parasites and Vectors in the spring semester with a lecture and Lab component. This
                           course familiarizes students with the diversity of tropical parasites that affect
                           humans and animals of human interest. This is a 4000/6000 level course. In the fall
                           semester I teach a graduate course, Molecular mechanisms of protein sorting and targeting.
                           This course focus on current theories of protein trafficking. I review the different
                           signal and machinery for correct targeting of proteins. Virology, a 4000/6000 course,
                           is also offer in the fall semester. In this course I focus primarily in the diversity
                           of human viruses, differences between DNA and RNA viruses, structure, mechanism of
                           infection and pathogenesis.
