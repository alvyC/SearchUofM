                     THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
                     
                     By William Shakespeare November 11-13 and 18-20, 2010 at 8 p.m.
                     
                     
                     PHOTOS When two sets of identical twins with identical names are shipwrecked as infants,
                        their father can save only one of each set. Years later, one Antipholus and one Dromio
                        arrive in Ephesus in search of their long-lost brothers only to find that everyone
                        there seems a little odd. Shakespeare's early farce is about the power of family,
                        love, mistaken identities and finding the way home in a world that seems both cruel
                        and mad.
