                     Students in the Communication Studies concentration receive advanced scholarly training
                        in preparation for positions in industry, government, healthcare, or non-profit sectors,

                     Film & Video Production Concentration
                     
                     The concentration in Film and Video production combines technical instruction with
                        courses in both motion picture and traditional communication studies to provide students
                        with the knowledge and tools necessary to function in the multifaceted world of audiovisual
                        production. The approach to media practice is broad enough to address the needs of
                        the independent artist, as well as those who seek to enter the industry.

                     PROGRAM BASICS
                     
                     Upon admission to the Master's program, students are advised by the Graduate Studies
                        Coordinator until they choose a major advisor, convene a committee, and submit a Plan
                        of Study for approval. Students work closely with their advisory committee to form
                        a plan appropriate to the student's scholarly goals. The plan spells out the student's
                        area of research and creative emphasis, lists the courses that s/he will take, and
                        offers a timetable for completing the MA. Students in the general Communication concentration
                        must complete at least 30 hours of coursework (10 classes) for the MA.
                     
                     
                     If in lieu of a thesis the student elects to complete the degree by taking comprehensive
                        exams, the degree requires at least 33 hours (11 classes) of coursework. The Film
                        and Video production concentration requires all students to complete a culminating
                        project.
                     
                     
                     Full-time students typically spend about two years to earn the MA. Obviously, this
                        varies depending on the student's success in moving through each stage of the program.
