                     Why Study Applied Anthropology at the University of Memphis?
                     
                     Anthropology is a fascinating field of study which promotes cross-cultural understanding
                        and appreciation for diversity, and helps us understand and address social inequality.
                        Most importantly, studying anthropology can help you find rewarding employment. Our
                        2014 MA Alumni Survey demonstrates the value of a degree in anthropology from the
                        University of Memphis:
                     
                     
                     Of the 52 respondents, 96% found employment in related fields and/or were admitted
                        to post-MA studies.
