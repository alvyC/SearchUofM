                     Memphis Law is proud to offer a Certificate in Tax for our students. Tax law affects
                        and influences nearly every aspect of our lives, from sales tax, income tax, property
                        tax, charitable deductions, tax credits and inheritance tax just to name a few areas.
                        Students studying tax law will be able to apply their knowledge not only to their
                        work but also to their daily decisions.
                     
                     
                     In studying the Internal Revenue Service Code, students in the Certificate in Tax
                        program develop and strengthen their critical thinking skills. Knowledge of the code
                        is essential not only for tax practitioners, but also for attorneys practicing in
                        various fields such as labor and employment, family law, insurance, social security,
                        workers compensation, and corporate litigation.

                     How to Enroll
                     
                     Students in good academic standing may enroll in the Certificate for Tax program after
                        completing one year of full-time law study (or 30 hours for part-time students).
                     
                     
                     A student enrolls by submitting a completed enrollment form to the Tax Certificate Director. In completing the form, the student must certify
                        that he/she can satisfy the requirements of the certificate program and is committed
                        to fulfilling its requirements. A student will be dropped from the program if he/she
                        fails to meet the requirements.
