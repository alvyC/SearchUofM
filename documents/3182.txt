                        if a student is registered with Disability Resources for Students, someone from that
                        office may be invited to attend the meeting.
                     
                     
                     The BIT is comprised of the following members:

                        The BIT meets regularly; however, the chair may call additional meetings as needed
                           to discuss pending issues. Communication of incidents of concern shall be reported
                           to the chair (via the BIT e-mail at bit@memphis.edu or by calling 901.678.2187), who will notify members and call a special meeting if
                           necessary. The chair may designate another BIT member to serve in his/her absence.
