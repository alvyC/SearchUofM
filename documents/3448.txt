                        mph. Tornadoes normally travel 30-40 mph. If you and your passengers are caught in
                        a tornado warning, the supervisor on duty will issue specific instructions via two-way
                        radio. Alerts are issued by the National Weather Service and are classified in two major
                        areas:
                     
                     
                     TORNADO WATCH This means conditions are such that storms capable of producing a tornado may develop.
                     
                     
                     TORNADO WARNING This means that either a tornado has been sighted or that it is highly probable that
                        one will develop.
                     
                     
                     A warning will be signaled by the outdoor warning sirens. TigerText, social media
                        and email alerts will be activated. Alert employees and students in your immediate
                        area.
                     
                     
                     Keep tuned to local radio if it is available.

                        Remember your priorities:
                        
                        Protect life
                        
                        Preserve property
                        
                        Maintain service
                        
                        Remain calm, be prepared to make decisions quickly
                        
                        Monitor local radio as the weather system develops and keep the two-way radio traffic
                           to a minimum to receive instructions
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     In the event that the National Weather Service issues a Tornado Warning and the outdoor
                        sirens are activated all buses must be evacuated in a safe and timely manner. Per
                        severe weather protocol outlined in the University of Memphis Crisis Management Plan,
                        please adhere to the following procedures:
                     
                     
                     All routes:
                     
                     
                        
                        Never try to outrun a tornado.
                        
                        Passengers must be informed of the situation and advised to exit the shuttle immediately
                           upon stopping.
                        
                        
                        Park the bus in any area and ensure the bus is not obstructing emergency vehicle traffic.
                        
                        Take shelter in the basement of the closest building, if a basement is not available,
                           find shelter in an interior room or hallway. Stay away from windows! If there is no time to get indoors, get out of the vehicle immediately and take shelter
                           in a ditch or low-lying area between the vehicle and the tornado. Do not take shelter
                           in a ditch that is downwind of the vehicle. Use arms to protect your head and neck.
                        
                        
                        Once the bus is evacuated the driver must:
                           
                              
                              Verify all passengers are evacuated
                              
                              Obtain a numerical count of passengers
                              
                              Notify your supervisor of your location
                              
                              Activate the 4-way hazard signals
                              
                              Turn off the bus and secure the door
                              
                              Seek shelter
                              
                           
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     All Clear Procedure:
                     
                     Once the supervisor on duty has verified an all clear has been issued by the National
                        Weather Service:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        All bus drivers will wait on instructions from the supervisor on duty
                        
                        Once advised, drivers will be instructed to board passengers and resume service
                        
                        Verify number of passengers and notify supervisor of discrepancies
                        
                        Report any passenger injuries
                        
                        Be alert for any road debris or downed power lines
                        
                        If bus is damaged and deemed unsafe for passengers, notify supervisor and remain at
                           location for additional instructions
