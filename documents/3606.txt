                     The Career Services Office provides support and guidance to current students and alumni

                     What is a Judicial Clerkship?
                     
                     A judicial clerk is a law school graduate who assists a judge in carrying out the
                        responsibilities of the judicial office. Most judicial clerks are appointed for one
                        or two years, although sometimes judges hire permanent or career clerks. Judicial
                        clerkships are different from judicial internships, which are performed by law students
                        during the summer or school year.
                     
                     
                     Why should you be interested in a Judicial Clerkship?
                     
                     A judicial clerkship is one of the most prestigious, interesting, and professionally
                        rewarding jobs in the legal profession. Judicial clerkships provide skills and connections
                        that will benefit you for your entire career. A judicial clerk obtains a behind-the-scenes
                        experience with the workings of the judicial system. Because judicial clerkships are
                        prestigious, obtaining a judicial clerkship can further career opportunities by providing
                        you a competitive edge in seeking both private and public sector legal employment.
