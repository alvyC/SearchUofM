                     The goal of the Hooks African American Male Initiative (HAAMI) is to increase academic,
                           personal, and career success among African American males attending the University
                           of Memphis (UofM), by positively impacting their retention and graduation rates. In
                           monthly group sessions,HAAMI participants learn from university faculty and staff
                           as well as business leaders. Session presentations include topics such as university
                           support resources, mental health, student loan debt, internship, professional etiquette,
                           and job readiness. Mentoring and individual coaching are additional components of
                           HAAMI. Enrollment in HAAMI takes place at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters.
