                        contract. The Memphis Plan will provide graduate assistants access to health care
                        at a reasonable cost. The Church Health Center is able to offer the Memphis Plan because
                        they have partnered with local doctors and hospitals that donate their services. Plan
                        members will not have to pay a deductible or copayment when seeking medical care and
                        GAs who take advantage of this plan will have access to the least expensive and highest
                        quality healthcare that the city of Memphis can offer. Dr. Morris noted that this,
                        "amazing gift is thanks to the generosity of the medical community of Memphis." It
                        is his hope that this new collaboration will encourage graduate students to learn
                        more about the work of the Church Health Center and get engaged with the organization
                        and the opportunities that it offers to the city. President Rudd thanked Dr. Morris
                        and the Memphis medical community for their wonderful work and acknowledged the hard
                        work of the Provost and the Graduate Student Association. Dr. Weddle-West added that,
                        "it is wonderful to see this come to fruition," and thanked all involved for their
                        commitment to bettering the health and welfare of graduate students at the U of M.
                        Graduate assistants will be contacted with Memphis Plan application directions later
                        this summer.
