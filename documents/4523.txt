                     The University of Memphis is dedicated to helping students, faculty and staff create
                        a vibrant, welcoming and inclusive environment. Currently, we are exploring options
                        for an Office of Inclusion and Sexual Diversity at the UofM. The Student Government

                     As shared previously, I am committed to containing administrative growth at our university,
                        particularly given the broad range of needs on campus. However, we are actively exploring
                        the current organizational structure and related resource allocation for an Office
                        of Inclusion and Sexual Diversity due to the importance of this issue.
                     
                     
                     Plans call for a graduate assistant to be appointed by July 1. The GA will research
                        services and trends provided through offices of inclusion on other college campuses.
                        Other details regarding the exact structure and staffing of the Office of Inclusion
                        and Sexual Diversity are still being finalized, with a keen eye on administrative
                        concerns raised above. The promotion of diversity on campus is critical to the University's
                        success, and we are committed to expanding knowledge, understanding and the well-being
                        of all.
                     
                     
                     Thank you,
