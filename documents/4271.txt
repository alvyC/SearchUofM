                        also do work in analyzing text. Much of my funded research involves building educational
                        software that uses artificial intelligence to teach students.

                        and 3-4 hours a week of work outside of meetings.

                     Project Description: I design, develop, and test computer systems that hold conversations
                        with people in natural language. One notable example is AutoTutor, an animated agent
                        (talking head) on the internet that helps students learn through conversations and
                        interactive simulations of virtual worlds. AutoTutor responds adaptively to the cognitive
                        states and emotions of the learner by tracking dialog content, facial expressions,
                        posture, speech, and interactions with the keyboard. My work is interdisciplinary,
                        with contributions from psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, education,
                        multimedia, and art. Another system is Coh-Metrix, a web facility that analyzes texts
                        on hundreds of measures of language, discourse, and cohesion. Students, staff, and
                        faculty work in research teams.
                     
                     
                     Requirements for Student Applicants: Hard work and willingness to work in research
                        teams.

                     Method of Compensation ( Volunteer, Academic Credit, or Stipend): Show promise by
                        volunteering and/or academic credit. Serious students get funding on grants (National
                        Science Foundation, Institute for Education Sciences).

                        of human learning and how to apply them in educational contexts.  More specifically,
                        our current research projects include: elaborative study methods (concept mapping),
                        text comprehension strategies, and spaced practice.  Requirements for Student Applicants: The student should have a 3.0 or above GPA,
                        successfully completed PSYC 3010 (Research and Statistics I), and have an interest

                        also be willing to commit a minimum of 4 hours per week to lab projects. (Note: Some
                        projects may require more or less time; thus, a flexible schedule is an added benefit)  Start date: Immediately  Method of Compensation: volunteer or academic credit.
