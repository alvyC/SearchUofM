                        also do work in analyzing text. Much of my funded research involves building educational
                        software that uses artificial intelligence to teach students.

                        and 3-4 hours a week of work outside of meetings.

                     Project Description: I design, develop, and test computer systems that hold conversations
                        with people in natural language. One notable example is AutoTutor, an animated agent
                        (talking head) on the internet that helps students learn through conversations and
                        interactive simulations of virtual worlds. AutoTutor responds adaptively to the cognitive
                        states and emotions of the learner by tracking dialog content, facial expressions,
                        posture, speech, and interactions with the keyboard. My work is interdisciplinary,
                        with contributions from psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, education,
                        multimedia, and art. Another system is Coh-Metrix, a web facility that analyzes texts
                        on hundreds of measures of language, discourse, and cohesion. Students, staff, and
                        faculty work in research teams.

                        Science Foundation, Institute for Education Sciences).
