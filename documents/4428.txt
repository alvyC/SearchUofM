                        The University offers a deferred (installment) payment plan to assist students with
                        the payment of enrollment fees for the Fall and Spring semesters (not available for
                        Summer terms). Please refer to the website above for complete information.
                     
                     
                     Returned Checks/Charge Card Drafts: It is expected that any check or credit card draft given to the University for any
                        reason will be honored by the bank on which it is drawn. Any check or draft dishonored
                        by the bank on which it is drawn may be presented a second time at the discretion
                        of the University. A $20.00 returned item fee will be assessed for any check/draft
                        returned.
                     
                     
                     The privilege of making payments to the University by personal check and check cashing
                        privileges will be revoked for any student who has had more than one returned check/draft
                        within a twelve-month period. The suspension of this privilege will be for a period
                        of one year from the date the last item is redeemed.
                     
                     
                     A student will not be permitted to satisfy registration fees by check if ANY previous
                        check in payment of registration (enrollment) fees has been returned unpaid. Any check
                        or credit card draft presented to the University in payment of enrollment fees that
                        is subsequently dishonored by the bank on which it is drawn will be assessed the Late
                        Payment Fee of $100.00. Students on a "NO CHECKS" status must be prepared to satisfy
                        registration fees with cash, cashier's check, or by authorized credit card draft.
                     
                     
                     Indebtedness to the University: Policy of the Tennessee Board of Regents prohibits the enrollment of any person who
                        owes the University any amount of money. All outstanding financial obligations to
                        the University must be satisfied before a student will be allowed to register for
                        courses. Tennessee law also prohibits the release of grades, transcripts, or diplomas
                        of any person who has outstanding financial obligations to the University.
                     
                     
                     Academic Common Market: Participation in the Academic Common Market provides qualified students from various
                        southern states with the opportunity to pay in-state enrollment fees while pursuing
                        certain degree programs at the University of Memphis. See Section 1 for a full description
                        of this program.

                        incapacitates them from the potential to work at an occupation that brings them an

                        an individual classroom basis.
                     
                     
                     Persons who are totally disabled and those who will become 65 years of age or older
