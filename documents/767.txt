                     Degree Program and Planning
                     
                     Each student is responsible for fulfilling all of the requirements for the degree
                        program being pursued and for following the procedures and regulations as stated in
                        the Catalog in effect when entering college. The Catalog is valid for seven years.
                        Students should keep a copy of the Catalog they enter under until they graduate. Assistance
                        from an advisor is helpful in planning the program of studies and in selecting the
                        specific courses to be taken for each semester.
                     
                     
                     The Graduation from the University section of the Catalog outlines the minimum university
                        level degree requirements. Some colleges specify the exact manner in which the university
                        level requirements must be met. In addition to these, the student must fulfill the
                        college level requirements for the degree and the major requirements. If the admission
                        or retention standards for a particular college or department differ from the University
                        requirements, they will be listed in the college degree program description. If they
                        do not, the University requirements apply. The guidelines below will be helpful in
                        planning which program to follow.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Read the Catalog to investigate what options are available.

                        If you are undecided about a major area, begin your program of studies with those
                           courses required for all degrees.

                        consult with your advisor to determine what procedures are necessary to declare a
                           major;
                        
                        
                        read the entire section of the Catalog that relates to the degree and major selected;
                           note all degree requirements listed for the college such as the number of hours required
                           within the college and outside the college and the number of upper division hours
                           required; list all the University General Education Program Requirements required

                        plan your coursework semester by semester; try to complete all of your lower division
                           courses (1000-2000) during your first two years; be sure to check for prerequisites
                           before enrolling in any courses, especially upper division courses; take the courses
                           in the proper sequence.
