                     Students enrolled in our Master of City and Regional Planning program can simultaneously
                        pursue a second master's degree in a complementary field. To facilitate dual degree
                        paths, up to 20 percent of the total combined credits required for the two degree
                        programs can be shared. (Regulations can be found in the Graduate Catalog .)
                     
                     
                     Pairing a second degree with a Master's in City and Regional Planning allows students
                        to develop a particular specialization or to simply broaden their perspective on public
                        policy. And the ability to apply certain credits to both degrees makes it easy. Students
                        may pursue a second degree in any program that meets their education needs, and we
                        can help you craft an appropriate path.
                     
                     
                     Here's an example:
                     
                     Master of City and Regional Planning and Master of Arts in Anthropology
                     
                     Training in Anthropology gives planners additional skills in qualitative research
                        methods and a broader understanding of social organization, socio-economic inequalities,
                        power and social justice, and cultural heritage. This dual degree path can be completed
                        in 6 semesters.

                        Certificate. In many cases a student can earn the Master's degree in and the Graduate
                        Certificate in just 4 semesters.
