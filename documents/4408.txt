                     My academic career began with a B.A. in psychology from Rhodes College. I then accepted
                        a Fulbright-Hays Full Grant to study the development of psychology as a scientific
                        paradigm at Georg August Universitaet in Germany. I completed my M.S. in clinical
                        psychology at Florida State University (1981) and my Ph.D. in clinical psychology
                        at The University of Memphis (1990). During my graduate training, I sub-specialized
                        in clinical health psychology and statistics and research methods.
                     
                     
                     After my internship, I accepted a position at Baptist Hospital as a clinical psychologist
                        serving medical/surgical patients, such as those with head trauma, spinal cord injuries,
                        pulmonary illnesses, and various other disorders. Following several years of clinical
                        work, I spent a decade as a researcher in a grant center at the University of Memphis.
                        Overall, I've garnered about $9 million as Principal Investigator or Co-PI in research
                        grants, primarily from NIH and private foundations.
                     
                     
                     In 2002 I accepted a tenured position in the Psychology Department, where I served
                        as Director of Clinical Training from 2009 – 2012. I am currently Director of the
                        Clinical Health area. Nationally, I am a board member of the Council of Clinical Health
                        Psychology Training Programs, the organization setting standards for training in clinical
                        health psychology. I am also a frequent reviewer for NIH and TRDRP study sections,
                        and I serve as a board member for the Tennessee Psychological Association.
