                     This is a three-week school conducted at Fort Benning, GA.
                     
                     At Jump School, you'll be introduced to your best friend - your parachute. You'll
                        get to know everything about it. How to wear it, adjust it, use it, the works. You'll
                        also learn all the techniques needed to accomplish your mission with absolute confidence;
                        how to stay loose, get ready for impact, let your legs absorb the shock, roll and
                        collapse your chute quickly, release your harness, unsling your weapon, and deploy
                        into position. Airborne officers are considered to be among the Army's most valuable
                        combat officers (Every member of the Rangers and Special Forces - two of the Army's
                        most elite corps - is airborne-qualified), and all officers can benefit from "going
                        Airborne." Being airborne-qualified will enhance an officer's value to the Army and
                        enhance his or her own chances for a valuable career.
                     
                     
                     Cadets in good physical condition may compete for a school allocation. A minimum Physical
                        Fitness score of 250 is required. At Airborne school, cadets will train alongside
                        Regular Army officers and enlisted men and women, as well as members of other armed
                        services, to jump from an Air Force aircraft (C130 or C17). Upon completion of the
                        course, cadets will earn the coveted Airborne Jump Wings and be parachutist qualified.
                        This course is extremely safe and boosts the confidence of all who have the opportunity
                        to attend.
