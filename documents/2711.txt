                     What Can I Do With A Degree in Religious Studies?
                     
                     In today's global economy and multicultural world, experience with differing cultures
                        and religions can prove to be a great boon. In careers requiring meeting and communicating
                        with people, having a good knowledge of incorporating multiple worldviews is key.
                        A minor in Religious Studies is an excellent way to stand out in a highly competitive
                        workforce, and the skills gained allow one to succeed in a wide range of careers,
                        from business to education, law to medicine.
