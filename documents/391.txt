                     Mission
                     
                     The Department of Social Work seeks to be a leader in social work education by: preparing
                        students with cutting-edge social work skills necessary to practice in complex settings;
                        creating knowledge through research and engaged scholarship; reducing poverty, inequality,
                        and social and economic injustice through evidence based practices; and addressing
                        the needs of the Mid-South within a global perspective.
                     
                     
                     Diversity Statement
                     
                     The Department of Social Work is committed to embracing diversity in every aspect
                        of our functioning and programming. We understand diversity as the intersection of
                        multiple factors including age, class, color, culture, disability, ethnicity, gender,
                        gender identity and expression, immigration status, national origin, political ideology,
                        race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We make a concerted and
                        deliberate effort to include a diverse student body and faculty across all axes of
                        difference. We endeavor to create a welcoming environment of inclusiveness and respect
                        for difference not only in background and demographics, but in point of view and opinion.
