                     the pinch journal
                     
                     The Pinch was founded in 1980 as the Memphis State Review by William Page. In its first few years, the journal published such well-known writers
                        as Robert Bly, Phillip Levine, Mary Oliver, Robert Penn Warren, and Margaret Atwood.
                     
                     
                     In 1988, the Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing Program was formed at The University
                        of Memphis, and Page handed his Editor in Chief position to Sharon Bryan. Under Bryan's
                        leadership, the Memphis State Review became River City and published notable issues such as "Where We Stand: Women Poets on Literary Tradition,"
                        which was later published as a book by W. W. Norton & Contemporary Culture.
                     
                     
                     From 1998 to 2001, Editor in Chief Thomas Russell returned River City to its focus on creative and literary works. He also published a special issue for
                        the 20th Anniversary of The River City Writers Series featuring the works of famous
                        authors such as Donald Justice, Marvin Bell, Adrienne Rich, Lucille Clifton, Mary
                        Gaitskill, John Updike, and Margaret Skinner, as well as the photography of William
                        Eggleston. In 2002, Editor in Chief Mary Leader refocused the journal to an emphasis
                        on poetry.
                     
                     
                     Kristen Iversen became Editor in Chief in 2005. The journal transitioned into The Pinch and expanded its focus on creative nonfiction. The Pinch became notable for its logo
                        and award-winning covers, which were designed by Gary Golightly, the Graphic Design
                        Program Coordinator of the University of Memphis Art Department. In 2014, Tim Johnston
                        took over as Editor in Chief. In 2014, Tim Johnston became as Editor in Chief. He has created a new mentoring program
                        to train incoming staff members, as well as partnerships with local arts venues and
                        schools. There is increased student participation and leadership at local and national
                        conferences. In recent years, contributors have included Steve Stern, Linda Gregerson, Bobbie Ann
                        Mason, Lee Gutkind, Scott Russell Sanders, George Singleton, Lee Sharkey, Ron Rash,
                        Bob Cowser, Jr., Steven Church, Robert Root, Dinty W. Moore, Floyd Skloot, and many
                        others.
