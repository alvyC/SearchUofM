                     The master's degree in Environmental Nutrition is a fully online, 33-credit hour program
                        that emphasizes nutritional issues through an environmental lens. The program examines
                        the relationships between food, nutrition, and the environment. The impact of nutritional
                        practices on the environment and the impact of the environment on nutritional practices
                        are the program focuses.
                     
                     
                     Relevant research and theoretical foundations towards best practices guides the curriculum.
                        Issues related to food sustainability, traditional food practices, food justice, and
                        alternative and complementary approaches to nutrition are examined. Students must
                        complete an applied project and internship grounded in the practical application of
                        sustainable nutrition practices.
                     
                     
                     Background of Candidates
                     
                     As a generalist program, Environmental Nutrition students have a variety of undergraduate
                        degrees including dietetics, nursing, health promotion, medicine, exercise science,
                        food science, biology, anthropology, psychology, and others. The program provides an advanced degree option for members of the work force with
                        food and nutrition responsibilities employed by schools, industry, health care, government,
                        and non-profit organizations. We invite applications from students who wish to emphasize applied work in sustainable
                        food and nutrition practices. Applicants must have a minimum of a bachelor's degree
                        with some background in the biological sciences and nutrition. Applicants will be
                        selected for admission to the program on the basis of grade point average, narrative
                        statement and personal goals, and letters of reference. Graduate record examination
                        (GRE) within the past five years may be submitted to support the application, but
                        is not required.
