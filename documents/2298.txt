                     Educational Psychology & Research
                     
                     The Educational Psychology and Research (EDPR) Program consists of two interrelated majors, Educational Psychology and Educational Research,
                        both offering doctorate (Ph.D.) and master's (M.S.) programs. Research is a high priority in both concentration areas, and student research, using an intensive research apprenticeship
                        model, is a focus of our programs. Our setting in an urban area offers rich diversity in research opportunities that include working with local schools
                        and community organizations.
                     
                     
                     Students in Educational Psychology can focus on human development within the domains of early childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and aging, focusing
                        on the cultural nature of these developmental processes in a changing society. Students
                        can also choose to study cognition and motivation in the domains of learning, critical thinking, self-regulation, and giftedness.
                     
                     
                     Students in Educational Research can choose a quantitative approach including measurement, statistical methods, research design, and institutional
                        research. They can also focus on a qualitative approach such as contemporary theories, strategies, research design, data collection
                        and analysis.
                     
                     
                     Our Master's of Science (M.S.) program prepares students with diverse backgrounds in education-related fields. Upon graduation,
                        many graduates from the M.S. program advance their professional careers. With a strong
                        emphasis on research in its coursework and daily activities, the program also prepares
                        M.S. degree students for entering the Ph.D. program.
                     
                     
                     The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in Educational Psychology and Research prepares graduates for teaching and research
                        at the university level, senior administrative positions, educational research, and
                        applied research in human services. Past students from the Ph.D. program have become
                        university professors, senior university administrators, and senior researchers and
                        analysts in both public and private sectors.
