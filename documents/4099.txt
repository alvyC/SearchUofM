                     TYPES OF ERRORSÂ 
                     
                     If you have the following errors, please contact our office at 901.678.5547:
                     
                     
                        
                        Water damage to the package and diploma (left on porch during rain)
                        
                        Bent diploma
                        
                        Incorrect degree or honors
                        
                        Incorrect spelling of name (does not include new name that is different from your
                           program approved name)
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     The damaged or incorrect diploma must be returned to our office before a new copy
                        can be released. Once the damaged or incorrect diploma is returned to us, we will
                        order a new copy of your original diploma at no cost to you. If your diploma was damaged
                        in shipment and you are in the Memphis area, we strongly encourage you to pick up
                        your diploma from our office once it is ready. Speak to a Commencement representative
                        for more details.Â 
                     
                     
                     Name Changes
                     
                     All students are required to proof their name in the program prior to Commencement.
                        The name listed in the Commencement program is the name that must stand on your diploma.
                        Any changes to your name after Commencement will require a Reorder Duplicate copy
                        of your diploma for $20.00.Â 
                     
                     
                     Unfortunately, the Commencement Office is unable to provide new diplomas that are
                        results of natural disasters, fires, floods, etc. Alums are able to order a duplicate
                        copy of a diploma for $20.00 at our Reorder Diploma site.Â
