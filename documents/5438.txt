                        Normally, individuals who are eligible for more than one benefit may use a maximum
                           combined total of 48 months of benefits. For example, if you have used 20 months of
                           benefits under REAP, you may be eligible for 28 months of benefits under the Post-9/11
                           GI Bill.
