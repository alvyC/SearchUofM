                        deposits of chert were selected by prehistoric Native Americans for the manufacture
                        of stone tools such as arrowheads, spear points, knives, and other tools instrumental
                        to everyday life. Students will be taught how to flintknap (the prehistoric art of
                        making stone tools), sample curation, database management, and spectroscopic analysis.
                        Students will also be given the opportunity to participate in field work related to
                        the collection of chert samples and documentation of prehistoric procurement sites.

                           needs students cannot be accommodated in the field, but options exist in the lab on
                           a case by case basis.

                     Project Description: 1) West Nile Virus in Shelby County: I use GIS and Remote sensing
                        techniques to explore the mosquito habitats and clustering analysis where the infected
                        mosquitoes are and the effected human cases. I am working with the Shelby County Health
                        Department on developing a model to lower the amount of cases in our county and explore
                        ways how to do better intervention. 2) Low birth weight and infant mortality: Birth
                        and death records from the Tennessee Department of Health are obtained. I am applying
                        clustering analysis techniques to find out where the most vulnerable places are in
                        Shelby County.
