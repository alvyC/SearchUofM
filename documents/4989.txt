                     How did human language come to exist, and how can observations of human infant development
                        inform the establishment of a workable theory of language evolution?
                     
                     
                     Modern evolutionary biology is guided by the theoretical innovations of "evo-devo"
                        or evolutionary developmental biology, which has primarily addressed mechanisms of
                        physical development (for example of body plans) that can be elucidated only when
                        evolution and development are jointly considered. We study vocal and vocal communicative
                        development in human infants, along with communication in a variety of other species
                        (e.g., canines, the Caribbean reef squid, non-human primates) in order to establish
                        a theoretical model of language with an evo-devo flavor. The model suggests that stages
                        of vocal development even in the first six months of life reveal that infants command
                        requirements of human language that must have been evolved by ancient hominins long
                        before modern language existed. Of key interest is the apparent fact that no other
                        primate ever commands key vocal skills that are seen in human infants by 3-6 months
                        of age. We reason that these skills must have emerged in human evolution at or shortly
                        after the split of humans from the lines that led to Chimpanzees and Bonobos.
