                        been fairly steady, fluctuating between 900-1000 master degrees per year and 260 doctoral
                        degrees. Our degrees per FTE, which is an overall efficiency measure, increased from
                        20.0 to 22.8 (a 14% increase in efficiency). Over the last two years our graduation
                        rate has hovered around 49%, but it has slipped slightly to 47.2% for the 2015-2016
                        six-year cohort, a trend that was consistent with all of our TBR university partners.
                        Despite the increase in overall graduation numbers, this hints at an underlying retention
                        problem that has persisted for decades and one that we are targeting with a clear
                        and well-coordinated strategy. It also suggests that our efforts targeting completion
                        for students previously disengaged (and well beyond the six-year graduation window)
                        have been successful.
                     
                     
                     Similarly, our quality indicators were very positive for the past academic year. Our
                        score summary is provided below. As you can see from the description of quality assurance
                        funding, the assessment is geared toward incentivizing meritorious performance. Two
                        years ago our score was 87, compared to 90 last year and this year's score of 92.
                        As you know, we all strive for excellence, and this is evidence of significant and
                        steady progress toward that goal. All indicators show that we are making progress
                        across multiple fronts, and most importantly, we are providing a high quality and
                        comprehensive educational experience for our students.
                     
                     
                     Thank you for your hard work, your commitment to our students and serving our community
                        so well.
