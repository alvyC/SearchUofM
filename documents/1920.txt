                     The National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium ( NCPC ), of which the U of M's Center for Information Assurance ( CfIA ) is a core member, has been awarded a $3M grant from DHS/FEMA to develop and deliver
                        cyber security training as part of the Continuing Training Grants (CTG) program.
                     
                     
                     
                     For this collaborative project, CfIA will receive a sub award of $500K for 3 years
                        to develop research-based best practices for cyber identity and authentication.  The
                        project will deliver a unique and innovative approach with "tabletop" scenarios supplementing
                        the online training to demonstrate participants' knowledge and skillsets to protect
                        and defend systems with different authentication tools and techniques. The online
                        training will assist state and federal jurisdictions with coordination and management
                        of response efforts between emergency response organizations and critical infrastructure
                        IT personnel necessary to prevent cyber incidents.
