                     Knowledge management systems (KMS) are systems designed to support organizational
                     knowledge processes. Knowledge-oriented theories of the firm are emerging, as theories
                     of KMS design continue to evolve. This paper adopts Habermas'theory of communicative
                     action and discourse ethics [Drake, B, Yuthas, K, and Dillard, J F., 'It's Only Words
                     - Impacts on Information Technology on Moral Dialogue', Journal of Business Ethics

                     [Churchman, C.W., The Design of Inquiring Systems: Basic Concepts of Systems and Organizations,
                     Basic Books, New York, NY, 1971.] Singerian inquiring system as kernel theories [Van
                     Gigch, J.P., 'The Paradigm of the Science of Management: In Celebration of C.W. Churchman's
                     80th Birthday,' Interfaces, 25 (2), March - April 1995, 81-88.] on which to base KMS
                     design principles. Specifically, we build on Churchman's nine requirements for an
                     object to constitute a system and his Singerian inquiring system, and Habermas' critical
                     theory to develop the notion of Churchmanian-Habermasian knowledge management systems
                     (CHKMS) and principles for their design. We define a CHKMS as a purposeful, ethical
                     and adaptable system that creates exoteric knowledge (relevant for solving social
                     and managerial problems) through communicative action, providing a link between knowledge
                     and action in an organization or community of practice. The design principles involve
                     a strong emphasis on ethical behavior, the development of success measures for CHKMS,
                     the need to ensure that the CHKMS enhances the dignity of humankind, a highly participatory
                     design process, the desire to unify the designers, the decision makers and clients,
                     the need to shape CHKMS components in relation to the system as a whole, and the need
                     for a 'guarantor'to validate knowledge through discursive communication and the 'cashing
                     in' of validity claims. The principles are illustrated by applying them to management
                     of knowledge concerning pediatric bipolar disorder. The implications of the design
                     theory for KMS research are discussed.
