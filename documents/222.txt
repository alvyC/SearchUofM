                     Believing that rigorous professional and/or personal development often occurs in settings
                        outside the traditional classroom, the University of Memphis grants Experiential Learning
                        Credit (ELC) to students who demonstrate the academic merit of such experiences. Experiential
                        learning is learning by doing.
                     
                     
                     What is ELC?
                     
                     Experiential Learning Credit is a highly individualized process that offers adult
                        and non-traditional students the unique opportunity to petition for college credit
                        for the knowledge, training, and skills they previously learned through a broad range
                        of experiences outside of the traditional academic setting.
                     
                     
                     What Are The Benefits of ELC?
                     
                     
                        
                        An ELC award will save money and accelerate degree completion.
                        
                        
                           
                           
                              
                              Undergraduate students are permitted to petition for up to 30 ELC hours at $75.00
                                 per credit hour.
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           
                              
                              Graduate students are permitted to petition for up to 9 ELC hours at $100.00 per credit
                                 hour.
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        ELC will reduce the repetition of relevant course-related material for students with
                           prior learning.
                        
                        
                        Most importantly, ELC enables students to gain greater insight about themselves, while
                           having the UofM validate the importance of their prior learning.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     What Prior Experiences May Qualify For ELC?
                     
                     Formal and informal learning experiences that have resulted from a rich array of:
                     
                     
                        
                        Professional Work Experiences
                        
                        Military
                        
                        Training Classes
                        
                        Professional Skills Workshops and Seminars
                        
                        Volunteerism
                        
                        Unique Life Experiences
                        
                     
                     
                     The ELC Program Guides Students As They:
                     
                     
                        
                        Identify areas of relevant learning from their past experiences,
                        
                        Demonstrate that learning through appropriate documentation,
                        
                        Submit learning materials for assessment, and
                        
                        Possibly gain academic credit for ELC.
                        
                     
                     
                     How Can I Participate In ELC?
                     
                     There are two pathways in which to participate in ELC and potentially earn academic
                        credit:
                     
                     
                     ELC Pre-Assessed : Many individuals have completed various kinds of training for which they have earned
                        credentials. Certain professional and standardized training, licensure, and certification
                        experiences whose content is equivalent to offerings from the UofM have been evaluated
                        by faculty for credit hours. Examples of such education credit include Microsoft Certifications
                        and Paramedics License. Current enrolled students are allowed to provide original
                        documentation as proof of satisfactory completion for prior learning experiences.
                     
                     
                     ELC Portfolio : Students without pre-assessed learning experiences are able to seek academic credits
                        by developing a portfolio. The portfolio serves as a reflective narrative of the student's
                        previous learning experiences and includes supporting documentation. Thus, the portfolio
                        helps students articulate what they know and can do, as well as integrate this learning
                        with the principles that would have been learned in university coursework. Strong,
                        professional ELC portfolios with breadth and depth will:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Clearly identify key learning concepts and describe concrete examples of the learning
                           experiences;
                        
                        
                        Critically reflect on the learning experiences;
                        
                        Thoroughly demonstrate an understanding of generalizations and principles gained from
                           the experiences; and,
                        
                        
                        Analyze how the learning can be applied in future personal and professional situations.
                        
                     
                     
                     You may be able to convert Critical Learning Events into College Credit by completing
                        the Experiential Learning Credit course which includes the following seven modules.
