                     Duo Account Security
                     
                     Account security has never been more important as an increasing number of businesses
                        and users are targeted by hackers. One can't read the news without seeing another
                        story regarding a company or service being compromised and data being stolen.  
                     
                     
                     Password management has always been a weak point in systems that rely solely on a
                        knowledge-based authentication factor. As the number of accounts that the average
                        user must maintain has exploded, passwords are reused across multiple systems, making
                        unassociated services vulnerable when a reused password is leaked.
                     
                     
                     More important, however, is the increasing sophistication of contemporary phishing
                        attacks. These targeted attacks can be difficult for even savvy users to avoid. Passwords
                        are simply no longer reliable as the sole method of authentication to sensitive systems.
                     
                     
                     What is Duo Account Security?
                     
                     
                     The UofM Web-SSO system now includes Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) capabilities.
                        This means that users can protect their accounts by requiring a secondary means of
                        authentication in addition to the password. Password-based authentication has become
                        increasingly vulnerable and MFA substantially reduces the threat of unauthorized access
                        to accounts.
                     
                     
                     The ITS Security team has implemented MFA using a product from Duo Security, which
                        allows users to leverage their phones as a second factor for authentication.  Users
                        can utilize the Duo Mobile application to enroll their smartphone or tablet to receive
                        online push notifications, or generate a one-time password.  Users can also enroll
                        an SMS number to receive notifications via text message, or enroll a phone number
                        to receive a phone call, depending on their preference.
                     
                     
                     Am I required to enroll in Duo Account Security?
                     
                     
                     ITS Security has made Duo Account Security available to all users on campus who wish
                        to opt-in to use the service.  All users are strongly encouraged to utilize the service
                        to increase the security of their account.  Unless otherwise noted below, users are
                        not required to enroll in the service. 
                     
                     
                     As of August 2016, all ITS staff are required to utilize Duo Account Security to protect
                        their accounts.
                     
                     
                     How do I enroll in Duo Account Security?
                     
                     
                     The UofM's self-enrollment process on iAM makes it easy to register your device and install the mobile app (if necessary).
                        Login to https://iam.memphis.edu and click "Duo Account Security" to begin. You will be guided through the process
                        of registering your phone. Once you have enabled Duo, you will be prompted to authenticate
                        with your second factor the next time you log in to any SSO-protected web resource.
                     
                     
                     It is strongly recommended that you have more than one device registered in case there
                        is an issue with your primary device.
