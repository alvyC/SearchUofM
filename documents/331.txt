                     The Department of Theatre & Dance at the University of Memphis fosters the development
                        of our students on an individual basis. We offer a BFA in Theatre with concentrations
                        in performance, musical theatre, dance and design and technical production as well
                        as an MFA in Theatre with concentrations in directing and design and technical production.
                        We tailor our program to your needs. We are large enough to offer dynamic performance,
                        design, and crew opportunities both in the classroom and in our four performances
                        spaces. We also create an intimate community for intense one-on-one learning opportunities.
                        Our diverse faculty nurtures the individual progress of each student, be they a budding
                        costume designer, a musical theatre performer, or stage manager. We are both a generalized
                        program (where students can explore all areas of theatre) and a specialized one (where
                        students can hone an area of focus).
                     
                     Exciting World of the Performing Arts The Department of Theatre & Dance at the University of Memphis invites you to join
                        us as we explore the exciting world of the performing arts. We are dedicated to a
                        unified program designed to help you learn to use your body, voice, and mind more
                        proficiently than you ever thought possible. We believe that each student should be
                        broadly prepared with as many meaningful artistic experiences as imaginable. We celebrate
                        theatre and dance in all its infinite varieties.
                     
                     Programs of Study We offer the BFA degree in Theatre with concentrations in performance, musical theatre,
                        dance and design and technical production, and graduate studies leading to an MFA
                        degree in Theatre. Within the MFA degree, training is available in Directing and in
                        Design and Technical Production. If you are a performer, you may notice that there
                        is no MFA program in acting, which means you are not competing with graduate actors
                        for roles! The University of Memphis is an accredited institutional member of the
                        National Association of Schools of Theatre. An Excellent Faculty Our emphasis on professionalism is reflected by the department's excellent faculty
                        of 17 teachers and artists dedicated to the nurturing of individual creativity. More
