                     The Office of Graduate Programs in the College of Education (COE) is responsible for
                        the effectiveness and integrity of the graduate programs offered by the college's
                        three departments: Counseling, Educational Psychology and Research, Instruction and
                        Curriculum Leadership, and Leadership.
                     
                     
                     Students, faculty, and staff look to the COE Office of Graduate Programs to interpret
                        and enforce policies as they pertain to the graduate programs and for notification
                        of impending deadlines and policy changes. It also functions as an initial source
                        for inquiries regarding the programs, degrees, and roles served by the departments
                        within the College.
                     
                     
                     Although the University Council, the COE Graduate Studies Council, and the Dean of
                        the Graduate School set policy, the COE Office of Graduate Programs serves as liaison
                        for the faculty, staff, students, and prospective students in communicating their
                        requirements and judgments pertaining to issues affecting them to those entities.
