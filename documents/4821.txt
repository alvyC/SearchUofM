      Driven By Doing
      
         
            "Disability Resources for Students was the first place where I felt like I was being
               listened to and taught about my disability, rather than solely being treated  for
               it. Through academic coaching meetings, tutoring  sessions, and guidance visits, DRS
               has helped me  become more confident in reaching for my goals. "
