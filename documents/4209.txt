                     Financial Conflicts of Interest(FCOI)
                     
                     Federal regulations, state laws and University policies recognize that researchers
                        may have financial interests in research sponsors and/or in entities with business
                        interests closely related to their research. The term " conflict of interest in research " refers to situations in which financial or other personal considerations may compromise,
                        or have the appearance of compromising a researcher's professional judgment in conducting
                        or reporting research.
                     
                     
                     Researchers must submit financial disclosure forms at the time of proposal submission
                        for research funding, when research gift funding is received, and when an application
                        for protocol is submitted for a project involving human subjects.  In those situations
                        where a financial interest and possible conflict of interest are disclosed, each situation
                        is reviewed by an independent substantive review committee.  At the University of
                        Memphis, that committee is established through Legal Counsel. This website contains
                        information regarding the Committee process, including the regulations, laws, policies,
                        and guidelines that govern disclosures and conflict of interest.
                     
                     
                     PHS-Funded Researchers must complete Conflict of Interest Training every four years.
                        The University of Memphis has elected to use the COI course of the CITI Program . If you submit a new PHS grant or receive/renew a new PHS award after August 24,
                        2012, you will be contacted to complete your disclosures prior to submission.
