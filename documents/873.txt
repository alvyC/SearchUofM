                     Overview
                     
                     An Advance account provides the Principal Investigator/Project Director (PI/PD) with
                        an opportunity to initiate sponsored research projects and begin incurring associated
                        expenses prior to institutional acceptance of an award.  Advance accounts allow PI/PD's
                        and departments to record and track expenditures and eliminate the need to charge
                        other unrelated accounts and perform cost transfers at a later time.
                     
                     
                     Requesting an Advance Account
                     
                     The PI/PD initiates a request by submitting an Advance Account Request Form (AARF)
                        to the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) through his/her department or school.  All
                        requests must have a valid submitted proposal through OSP and a high expectation that
                        the project will be awarded.

                     The Advance Account Request Form (click here) is a fillable PDF which you can download to your computer.  If your browser does
                        not support fillable forms, download the form to your computer and use Adobe Acrobat

                     Establishing an Advance Account and Possible Negotiation Issues and Risk
                     
                     In the majority of cases, OSP will establish an advance account upon request because
                        the University has an established history with the sponsor and the issues to be reviewed
                        prior to executing the requisite agreement are routine. There are some cases, however,
                        where significant negotiation of areas of concerns to the PI/PD, the department and/or
                        school, and the University may be required. In these instances, prior to establishing
                        the account, the Director of OSP will identify areas of concern and the associated
                        financial and non-financial risks, to the extent these risks can be identified, to
                        ensure the PI/PD and his/her department or school are aware of the risks they are
                        accepting.
                     
                     
                     Examples of negotiation issues include, but are not limited to, control of scope of
                        work and key personnel; subaward issues; publication restrictions and confidentiality
                        requirements; lack of criteria for acceptable performance; intellectual property terms;
                        termination and default clauses; and indemnification.
                     
                     
                     In requesting and accepting an advance account on behalf of a PI/PD, the department
                        or school assumes the financial risk in the event the award is not made, not accepted,
                        or if the terms of the award deem certain expenditures to be unallowable.  The OSP
                        will use its best efforts to finalize an award, but cannot guarantee a successful
                        outcome of any award negotiation.
                     
                     
                     Time Period
                     
                     Ordinarily, an account may be in advance status no more than 120 days from the start
                        date of the advance account budget period.  Advance accounts that have not been converted
                        to active status within 120 days of the start date of the budget period may be subject
                        to closure and expenditures transferred to an appropriate unrestricted account.
                     
                     
                     Using Advance Accounts
                     
                     Advance accounts should be used prudently. Only those costs that are incurred:
                     
                     
                        
                        Within the project period;
                        
                        In accordance with applicable regulations, e.g., OMB Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200, PHS
                           Grants Policy Statement, sponsor specific regulations, and;
                        
                        
                        Depending on the sponsor, have been included in the approved budget should be charged
                           to the account.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     As stated previously, any expenditure incurred while an account is in advance status
                        is made at the department's or school's risk. At the time of initial account request,
                        the department or school designee is required to agree in writing to cover any expenditure
                        if the award is not made or if sponsor awarded conditions preclude reimbursement for
                        expenses that precede the award start date or are otherwise deemed unallowable and
                        to provide an account number should it be necessary to transfer expenses.
                     
                     
                     Pre-Award Spending and Advance Accounts
                     
                     While PI/PD's may also use the AARF to request pre-award spending, i.e., approval
                        for costs to be incurred prior to the starting date of the award, authorization of
                        pre-award spending should not be confused with authorization of an advance account.
                         The AARF can now be used to request simultaneous approval of pre-award spending,
                        an allowable cost on many federal awards, and establishment of an advance account.
                        Before incurring pre-award expenses, the PI/PD should consult with the Director of
                        OSP to confirm whether pre-award expenses are permissible under the applicable sponsor
                        regulations or terms.
                     
                     
                     Monitoring Advance Accounts
                     
                     On a monthly basis OSP will provide each school with a report that lists all advance
                        accounts and includes account number, PI, sponsor name, projected budget period, funding
                        amount authorized for pre-award expenses, and cumulative expenditures. Based on these
                        monthly reports, accounts in advance status beyond their effective dates will be identified
                        for discussion with the PI and school or department to identify reasons for the delay
                        and possible solutions. Throughout the advance account period it is the responsibility
                        of the PI and department/school to keep each other apprised of developments regarding
                        award notification, acceptance, and negotiation.
                     
                     
                     Removing an Account from Advance Status
                     
                     Upon acceptance of the award by the University, the account will be removed from advance
                        status by the Office of Sponsored Programs. The department/school is responsible for
                        removing expenditures from the advance account if the award is not made, not accepted,
                        or if the terms of the award deem expenditures to be unallowable. If expenditures
                        are not removed from the advance account within 30 days of written request of their
                        removal, Grants Accounting/Business & Finance will transfer the expenditures to the
                        designated account provided by the department/school at the time the advance account
                        was established.
                     
                     
                     Signature Requirements
                     
                     Prior to submission to OSP, the following signatures are required on the AAFP:
