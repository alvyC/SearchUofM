                     The symbols [F], [S], and [Su] in the lists below indicate semesters (Fall, Spring,
                     and Summer, respectively) in which courses are usually taught. Some courses (indicated
                     by [ST]) are offered on an irregular basis, usually not more frequently than once
                     every two years. For the laboratory courses indicated with an asterisk (*) in the list below, the University
                     will assess a $30 material fee in addition to tuition.
