                     Purpose
                     
                     The Health Law Society ("HLS") is dedicated to exploring the intersection between
                        medical health care and the judicial system. The HLS examines not only the traditional
                        areas of health law, but also delves deeper into local and national health policy
                        concerns. The HLS strives to enhance the experience and knowledge of its members and
                        the entire Memphis law community.
                     
                     
                     Summary
                     
                     The Health Law Society is a new student organization at the University of Memphis,
                        Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law. The Society is dedicated to exploring the intersection
                        between medical health care and the judicial system. The Society examines not only
                        the traditional areas of health law, but also delves deeper into local and national
                        health policy concerns. The Society strives to enhance the experience and knowledge
                        of its members and the entire Memphis law community.
                     
                     
                     In its first year, the Society offered its members many networking and leadership
                        opportunities. The Society hosted a "speed networking" event. At the event, local
                        health lawyers had short one-on-one mentoring sessions with law students. The event
                        was a huge success and will occur yearly. The Society provided another networking
                        opportunity by partnering with the health law section of the Memphis Bar Association
                        for a happy hour-networking event. The happy hour allowed students to interact with
                        health lawyers in an informal and comfortable atmosphere. The relationships established
                        at these events have led to many lawyer-student mentoring relationships.
                     
                     
                     The members of the Society contributed short summaries of legal issues to the health
                        law section of the Memphis Bar Association's newsletters. This was a great way to
                        introduce the Society members to the local health law community and to display their
                        writing skills. Lastly, the members of the Society were given the wonderful opportunity
                        to meet both Fred Grey and Dr. Jim Jones at the law school's inaugural health law
                        symposium. Fred Grey, attorney, represented both Martin Luther King, Jr. and the participants
                        of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Dr. Jim Jones is the author of Bad Blood, a book detailing
                        the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and analyzing the effects of institutionalized discrimination
                        on marginalized segments of a population. It was truly a once in a life time opportunity
                        to meet such inspirational health law figures! The Society is looking forward to another
                        year full of health law
