                     In conjunction with the generous book donation, Dr. Elswick provided her time and expertise to create a social-emotional educational
                           curriculum specific to each donated book . The book themed curriculum includes both teacher and parent activities aimed at
                        improving social skills and empathy. The classroom based activities will be used to
                        enhance emotional learning and improve social outcomes for the children in the school.
                        The parent curriculum is aimed at encouraging parents to read to their children, discuss
                        feelings and emotions, and encourage healthy emotional outcomes through daily parent-child
                        activities.The curriculum will be made available to the teachers and parents at the
                        RELC program, but will also be made available to the public via MCS, Shelby County
                        Head Start, and University of Memphis websites.
