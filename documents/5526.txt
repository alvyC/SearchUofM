    Policy Statement



  
  
     
    
      This document details procedures to be followed in the establishment or 
      modification of University building or facility identification 
      information. Only upon approval by the President is building 
      identification information official. Only official building identification 
      information may be utilized in University publications and maps, and for 
      physical signage. Alternate identification information (i.e., names and 
      abbreviations) may not be used.
      The inventory of the University's physical facilities maintained 
      by the Office of Space Planning & Utilization is the official source 
      for building identification information.
      Tennessee Board of Regents Policy No. 4:02:05:01, Naming Buildings and 
      Facilities and Building Plaques, must be followed when naming a building 
      or facility for an individual.



  
  
    
    Purpose



  
  
     
    This policy establishes uniform guidelines and procedures to be 
      followed regarding the proper identification of all University buildings 
      and facilities. 



  
  
    
    Definitions



  
  
    Building Identification 
      Information
    
      That set of information related to the identification of a building or 
      facility. Includes:
      
        the Official Building Name, 
        the Environmental Graphics name (for use on physical signage), 
        an Abbreviated Name, 
        a 2-5 character Abbreviation (for use on maps), 
        the Official Street Address, 
        the Official Mailing Address, and 
        the Official Building Number (established by Accounting). 
  



  
  
    
    Procedures



  
  
    Assignment 
      or Change in Building/Facility Identification
    When a capital funding request or other documents seeking project 
      approval are submitted to the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR), a 
      temporary usage name will be utilized by Campus Planning and Design as 
      approved by the Vice President for Business and Finance.  The 
      temporary name will be used to identify the project until the official 
      building name is assigned.  Once the project is approved by TBR 
      and the State Building Commission and funding has been allocated, a 
      building number will be assigned by Accounting.  The building number 
      will not change.  
      When ready to finalize permanent identification for the building or 
      facility, the Office of Space Planning & Utilization 
      will contact the following departments for additional information 
      as noted:
       - Physical Plant will obtain the official street address from 
      Memphis Light Gas & Water
       - Campus Planning & Design will develop the proposed official 
      environmental graphics name for the facility
       - Office of Space Planning & Utilization will develop the 
      official building abbreviation consistent with established formatting 
      guidelines and "wayfinding" practices
       - Mail Services will assign the official Mailing Address.
      The Office of Space Planning & Utilization will provide this 
      information to the Facilities and Services Standing Committee for 
      completion of the 'Recommendation of Assignment or Change in 
      Building/Facility Identification' form (available from the Office of Space 
      Planning & Utilization). The Facilities and Services Standing 
      Committee will include its recommendation for the official building 
      name.
      The Facilities and Services Standing Committee will forward the 
      completed form to the Vice President for Business and Finance for 
      endorsement and submittal to the President for approval.
      When the need arises to modify the identification of a building (e.g., 
      name change), the same procedure as that used for initial identification 
      will be utilized.

  
  
    Distribution 
      of Building Identification Information
    Upon approval by the President, the signed document will be provided 
      to the Office of Space Planning and Utilization for use in maintaining the 
      official building identification information in the Physical Facilities 
      Inventory.  
      Campus Planning & Design will inform TBR of the results 
      and the Office of Space Planning & Utilization will 
      distribute copies of the approved "Recommendation of Assignment or Change 
      in Building/Facility Identification" to the following offices.  These 
      offices are responsible for maintaining the official names and 
      abbreviations in the databases and publications for which they are 
      responsible.  Alternate names and abbreviations are not to be 
      used.
