                     The University of Memphis is home to the first Confucius Institute in the state of
                        Tennessee and the first in the Mid-South.
                     
                     
                     In conjunction with its partner institution, Hubei University in China, the Confucius
                        Institute at the University of Memphis promotes understanding of the Chinese language
                        and culture among the people of the United States, develops friendly relations between
                        the U. S. and China, accelerates the expansion of multiculturalism, and provides opportunities
                        for students studying the Chinese language.
                     
                     
                     The Confucius Institute at the University of Memphis is housed on the entire 11th
                        floor of Wilder Tower. A statue of Confucius, designed by a local artist, greets visitors
                        to the Institute.
                     
                     
                     The Confucius Institute at the University of Memphis is closely affiliated with the
                        University’s new Asian Studies and International Trade program, whose aim is to provide
                        students with the critical combination of skills that an increasing number of companies
                        seek: international business knowledge, foreign language proficiency, cultural sensitivity
                        and experience abroad. The program was created by an anonymous $1 million donation
                        to the University.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis has long participated in educational exchanges with a number
                        of universities in China, including Hubei University, its partner in the Confucius
                        Institute.
                     
                     
                     A pilot institute was established in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in June 2004. The first
                        Confucius Institute opened on November 21, 2004 in Seoul, Korea.
