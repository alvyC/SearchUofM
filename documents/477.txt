                     Women's and Gender Studies at the University of Memphis is an academic program that
                        focuses on the scholarship of women and gender, and how we think about race, class,
                        sexuality and social inequality. Our interdisciplinary program offers an undergraduate
                        minor and a graduate certificate.

                     Since Women's and Gender Studies is an interdisciplinary program, not a department,
                        we draw most of our courses from departments throughout the university. Please check
                        with individual departments for further information on these courses, and verify meeting
                        times through the online course scheduling system. If you have questions about courses
                        not listed here, please contact the Assistant Director of Women's and Gender Studies,
                        Dr. Marygrace Hemme mehemme@memphis.edu . (The Director of Women's and Gender Studies, Dr. Kathy Lou Schultz is on leave for
                        the 2016-2017 academic year.)
