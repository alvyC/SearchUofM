                           interest lies in the intersection of computer science and biological sciences. His
                           recent work focuses on the analysis of microarray data, the design of synthetic genes,
                           and the construction of large DNA sets suitable for large-scale DNA-based computing.
                        
                        
                        At the University of Memphis, Dr. Phan has taught a variety of courses focusing on
                           the design and analysis of algorithms and their applications to the fields of bioinformatics
                           and bio-computing. For the past several years, he has chaired the Undergraduate Curriculum
                           Committee to ensure the effective, practical education and training of computer science
                           majors. He has also mentored many students, supervised the student ACM chapter, and
                           been involved in various outreach activities to attract high-school students to computing.
