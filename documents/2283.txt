                     Major in COMM at the UofM
                     
                     The COMM Department offers two concentrations at the undergrad level: Communication
                        Studies (at the main campus, the Lambuth campus, and online) and Film & Video Production
                        (at the main campus only).
                     
                     
                     Communication Studies offers students a broad education spanning interpersonal, public,
                        and mediated communication practices, preparing students for a range of careers. Film
                        & Video Production offers students the skills and knowledge necessary for employment
                        in the film and video production industry or as an independent filmmaker. Both concentrations
                        prepare students for graduate study as well.
                     
                     
                     We offer our majors a variety of co-curricular opportunities, such as Lambda Pi Eta,
                        the National Communication Honor Society; the annual public speaking competition;
                        the annual student film festival, Focus Fest at Malco's Studio on the Square; and
                        volunteer opportunities at the campus radio station, WUMR Jazz 92 FM.
                     
                     
                     We also offer a variety of hands-on, "real world" learning experiences through service
                        learning in select courses as well as credit for internships.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        "As an adult learner, I initially felt a little intimidated with getting back on the
                           education track. My advisors worked with me to devise an aggressive plan that helped
                           me complete my studies in record time and ultimately land a wonderful position with
                           KQ Communications, a purpose-driven marketing, PR and creative services firm where
                           every day I am empowered to use what I learned and do what I love: communications."
