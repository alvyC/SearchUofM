                     This study frames antecedents of effective information use, outlining a nomological
                        network that firms follow to achieve integrated information delivery and effective
                        information use. Our focus is on senior business executives' assessment of information
                        delivered by their organizations' information systems. We first clarify the definition
                        of information as it relates to information delivery and effective use. Then, drawing
                        from institutional theory and the resource-based view of the firm, we propose a research
                        model consisting of external institutional pressure, internal information systems
                        (IS) resources, integrated information delivery, and effective information use and
                        empirically test it through a field survey of senior business executives and post
                        hoc qualitative analysis. Our findings position information delivery as an important
                        research construct leading to effective information use and value. Our study also
                        highlights the important role of the IS function as a facilitator of effective information
                        use and a nurturer of a strong information culture in organizations. Finally, we offer
                        practical advice on how senior executives assess and improve integrated information
                        delivery and effective use.
