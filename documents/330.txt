The Cat Is Out of the Bag!
On 9.10.11@12 noon the UofM Alumni Association Let the Cat Out of the Bag ! At this event, ALL 100 of the Tiger statues were gathered on the UofM campus for the community to see together in one place.
Thank you to our Tiger family that came to welcome the Tigers to town! We would also
like to thank each of our sponsors and artists that made this project possible.

In honor of the University's Centennial, the Alumni Association placed life-size Tiger
statues around the city of Memphis in January 2012. Each statue has been uniquely
decorated with artwork by Mid-South artists, students and alumni. The Tiger statues
are sponsored by local fans, alumni and businesses and are currently on display at
their chosen locations or on the UofM campus.

It is our hope that Tigers Around Town will not only bring many alumni back to campus
but that it will also help build awareness of the integral relationship between the
University and the city of Memphis.

For more information about Tigers Around Town or to learn how you can adopt a Tiger,
contact the Alumni Association at alumniassociation@memphis.edu or 901-678-ALUM.
