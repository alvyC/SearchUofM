                        and career goals. This Online Orientation Guide is a resource tool for you to use
                        throughout your program of studies. The Orientation Guide will serve as a gateway
                        for getting started and will help you navigate your way to graduation.
                     
                     
                     Getting Started
                     
                     Your first step is to meet (face-to-face or online) with your assigned advisor and
                        continue to meet with her/him each semester. Upon acceptance to the program you were
                        given the name of your assigned faculty advisor. The following link will take to the
                        advising resource page and introduce you to your advisor. 
                     
                     
                     Portfolio
                     
                     Each student is required to produce a portfolio prior to graduation. The portfolio
                        addresses the learning competencies required for the program, and is a substantial
                        body of work that you need to begin building with your first class. The portfolio
                        is defended during the semester of planned graduation and is coordinated through your
                        advisor. The following link will provide details of the portfolio including submission
                        and defense dates and a sample portfolio .    
                     
                     
                     Online Program Technology Requirements
                     
                     The online program requires students to be able to hold audio and video conferences
                        with the faculty. This can be accomplished with a web cam (many computers have them
                        built-in) and a communication resource such as SKYPE. The following link will give
                        technical information necessary to use e-courseware and other UofM online resources .
