                        by SHRM as being in alignment with its suggested guides and templates. The HR Curriculum Guidebook and Templates were developed by SHRM to define the minimum HR content areas that should be studied
                        by HR students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The guidelines -- created
                        in 2006 and revalidated in 2010 and 2013 -- are part of SHRM's Academic Initiative
                        to define HR education standards taught in university business schools and help universities
                        develop degree programs that follow these standards.
