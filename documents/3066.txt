                        and acute episodic outpatient medical care. Individualized attention, courtesy and
                        patient confidentiality to all is of primary importance.
                     
                     
                     We are a Walk-In Clinic. No appointment is necessary.  Student Health Center is staffed with Nurse Practitioners, Registered Nurses, Licensed
                        Practical Nurse, Laboratory and X-ray Technologist, Health Educator, and various administrative
                        support personnel.
                     
                     
                     A Dispensary is available for the convenience of our students. Faculty and Staff are not eligible to have prescriptions
                        filled at our onsite dispensary. Most frequently used prescription medications written
                        by the Student Health Center's Nurse Practitioners, as well as a variety of over-the-counter
                        medications, may be purchased at a nominal charge.
                     
                     
                     Short-term, acute illnesses and injuries are addressed at Student Health Center. Patients with chronic, complex or recurrent
                        medical conditions must continue to use their primary care physician for issues related
                        to their chronic illness. No routine physicals are performed at Student Health Center.
                        Only lab tests ordered by Student Health Center medical providers will be performed.
                     
                     
                     Job related injuries are not treated at Student Health Center. If you are an employee or student employee
                        at the university and you are injured on the job, you must report the incident to
                        your supervisor who will obtain the appropriate paperwork from the Human Resources
                        Department.
