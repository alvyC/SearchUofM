                        by a youth in a special dance in which the fearsome jaguar plagues the farm who must
                        slay the jaguar in order to protect his field. He hunts the jaguar with the aid of
                        a dog named Maravilla (Miracle).

                     2 DEATH MASK, Guerrero, Mexico Wood and pigment Art Museum purchase made possible
                        by a Southern Arts Federation Grant 1984.004.026 This mask evokes ancient traditions
                        of death representations that abound in the pre-Columbian period and survive in connection

                        2016.007.001 The smooth surface of this mask provides a dramatic contrast to the sharply
                        carved braided hair and facial scarifications. Complex hair braiding is a mark of
                        internal and external beauty among the Mende people.

                        2016.007.003 This "medicine head" is a solid, miniature version of a bundu helmet
                        mask. Sculptures such as this embody the spiritual power or "medicine" of bundu masks
                        and the Sande Society.

                        Gift of Robert and Martha Fogelman 2008.002.166 The yam (a tuber similar to the sweet
                        potato) is the staple of the Abelam diet and important to their daily life and survival.
                        Village men wear yam masks at festivals when yams are planted and before the crop
                        is harvested. During the ceremonies, the Abelam ask their ancestor spirits to provide
                        an abundant crop of yams to each village.
