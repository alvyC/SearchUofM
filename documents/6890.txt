                     Within the context of knowledge management, little research has been conducted that
                     identifies the antecedents of a knowledge-centered culture�those organizational qualities
                     that encourage knowledge creation and dissemination. In this study, the existing literature
                     on organizational climate, job characteristics, and organizational learning (in the
                     form of cooperative learning theory) are linked with the current thinking and research
                     findings related to knowledge management to develop a theoretical model explaining
                     the relationships among organizational climate, the level of cooperative learning
                     that takes place between knowledge workers, and the resulting level of knowledge created
                     and disseminated as measured by team performance and individual satisfaction levels.
                     The study goes on to empirically test the proposed research model by investigating
                     the climate of organizations, and seeks to understand the linkage between a set of
                     organizational and individual characteristics and knowledge-related activities found
                     in cooperative learning groups and the resulting work outcomes. The hypothesized research
                     model is tested using LISREL with data collected from 203 information systems (IS)
                     professionals engaged in systems development activities. The paper concludes with
                     a discussion of the implications the results have for future research and managerial
                     practice.
