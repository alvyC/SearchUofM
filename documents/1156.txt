	   Your UofM Alumni Association hosts hundreds of events throughout the year to keep our alumni and friends connected. A few of our signature events include:

    Distinguished Alumni Awards - This event is hosted annually to recognize the University's distinguished alumni and friends. This award is the highest honor given by the University
    Faculty & Staff Awards - Each spring, the UofM Alumni Association honors members of our research community, faculty members and advisors. Recipients receive a plaque and a stipend.
    Homecoming - Each fall we welcome our alumni and friends back home for a special celebration on campus, including a parade, pep rally, True Blue Tailgate and more!

 
Tigers Around Town
In honor of the University's Centennial, the Alumni Association placed life-size Tiger
statues around the city of Memphis in January 2012. Each statue has been uniquely
decorated with artwork by Mid-South artists, students and alumni. The Tiger statues
are sponsored by local fans, alumni and businesses and are currently on display at
their chosen locations or on the UofM campus.
