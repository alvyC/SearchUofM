                     Having a clear point of contact in a leadership position is key. A knowledgeable contact
                        can help navigate the UofM's resources and assist in developing a comprehensive partnership
                        with shared objectives and mutually beneficial outcomes.
                     
                     
                     Below are some strategies for establishing an effective corporate partnership with
                        the UofM.
                     
                     
                     Be Active. 
                     
                     Companies that maintain an active dialogue with career services staff and get to know
                        our students through internship and co-op programs are the ones who have the relationships
                        with young alumni and expert faculty, which leads to long-term relationships.
                     
                     
                     Be Present. 
                     
                     Corporate representatives speaking regularly in classes, serving on advisory boards,
                        funding relevant programs, and creatively exploring opportunities result in mutually
                        beneficial partnerships.
                     
                     
                     Be Engaged ... and encourage your employees to engage, too! 
                     
                     Often, strong relationships are the result of a network of alumni who are passionate
                        about their alma mater. Alumni passion ignites engagement at all levels and in all
                        aspects of the UofM.
                     
                     
                     Be Committed. 
                     
                     Companies that approach the UofM for talent alone are missing out! Designate a strategic,
                        forward-thinking senior executive who makes and keeps commitments. Clear, and committed,
                        points of contact for both the company and the university allow for candid, yet strategic,
                        discussion.
                     
                     
                     Be Invested. 
                     
                     Our partners value the expertise of the UofM as much as they value their key suppliers
                        of materials, components and services. Our corporate partners view the UofM as trusted
                        business partners: we craft joint agendas, discuss research affiliate and partner
                        programs, and explore investment in scholarships, equipment and software, and laboratories
                        and facilities.
