                              The Black Student Association was founded in 1963 by a small group of African American
                                 students. It was founded on the principles of encouraging academic excellence, social,
                                 and political awareness. Throughout the years the Black Student Association has grown
                                 and flourished into an organization that not only represents African American students
                                 but also strives for the excellence of all students at The University of Memphis.
                                 Today, the Black Student Association continues the legacy on which it was founded
                                 by "Engaging the Torch that Leads to Excellence in service, education, justice, and
                                 unity".

                              In the spring semester of 2003, a group of African American male students and the
                                 Associate Dean of Minority Affairs at The University of Memphis recognized that the
                                 retention of the African American male student population was decreasing. They believed
                                 that there was a need for an organization that would provide support and serve the
                                 needs of the African American male to help increase their rate of retention at the
                                 university. Therefore, during the summer, they organized and founded Empowered Men
                                 of Color (EMOC), whose purpose is to promote greater awareness and understanding of
                                 issues concerning the minority male and becoming role models, mentors, and their brothers'
                                 keeper.

                              The Hispanic Student Association (HSA) was founded in the Spring of 1999 due to the
                                 effort of their President Nestor "Ito" Rodriguez. The Organization was created to
                                 spread awareness of Hispanic culture, and give the Hispanic population of The University
                                 of Memphis a voice on campus. Their purpose is to bring together University of Memphis
                                 students of all backgrounds and expose them to the diversity and richness of Latin
                                 culture while having fun through community activities and social events.
