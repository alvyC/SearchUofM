                        to scholarly excellence and deep community involvement.
                     
                     
                     The Center is regarded as a national leader in promoting an integrative approach to
                        understanding and addressing inequities in our society. The Center's approach to research,
                        theory and programming emphasizes the structural relationships among race, class,
                        gender, and sexuality, particularly in the U.S. South and among women of color.
                     
                     
                     This kind of action-oriented, community-based research strengthens the public's understanding
                        of women's experiences and informs local, regional and national public policy.
