                     University of Memphis To Lead $4 Million NSF Cyberinfrastructure Project
                     
                     September 15, 2016 - The University of Memphis will lead a team of researchers from
                        three other universities — UCLA, UC San Francisco, and University of Pennsylvania
                        — on a data cyberinfrastructure grant by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The
                        team will develop a new cyberinfrastructure, called mProv, to annotate high-frequency
                        mobile sensor data with data source, quality, validity, and semantics to enable sharing
                        of such data with the wider research community.
                     
                     
                     The project, mProv: Provenance-based Data Analytics Cyberinfrastructure for High-frequency
                        Mobile Sensor Data, will be led by Dr. Santosh Kumar, a professor and Moss Chair of
                        Excellence in Computer Science. Dr. Zachary Ives, another computer scientist, will
                        lead the University of Pennsylvania team, Dr. Ida Sim, a professor of Medicine and
                        medical informaticist, will lead the UCSF site, and Dr. Mani Srivastava, an electrical
                        engineer and computer scientist, will lead the UCLA team. Other collaborators on the
                        project include Open mHealth, Open Humans, and Quantified Self.
                     
                     
                     Mobile sensors (embedded in phones, vehicles, wearables, and the environment) continuously
                        capture data in great detail, and hold tremendous potential to advance science, and
                        to directly impact health, wellness, mobility/transportation, and energy. The open-source
                        software developed by the NIH-funded Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge
                        (MD2K), also led by Kumar and involving UCLA and UCSF, allows any researcher to collect,
                        analyze, and interpret high-frequency sensor data from the natural environment. However,
                        research with such sensor data is still out of reach for most researchers; it involves
                        significant resources and expertise to acquire sensors, obtain study approval, and
                        recruit human subjects before collecting the data.
                     
                     
                     By developing a provenance cyberinfrastructure that will integrate metadata with streaming
                        sensor data, the mProv project will enable sharing of mobile sensor data with third
                        party researchers. It will accelerate research by tapping into the growing interest
                        by the research community and unleash the potential of mobile sensor data to improve
                        health and wellness on an individual level by developing computational models of human
                        health and behavior.
                     
                     
                     Said Kumar: "With the mProv provenance cyberinfrastructure complementing MD2K's software,
                        investigators can collect, curate, analyze, and interpret mobile sensor data, as well
                        as share data. Doing so can amplify the research utility of their data and, most importantly,
                        help establish benchmarks and bring reproducibility, which are key to scientific rigor."
                     
                     
                     "The mProv tools will make it convenient to generate and propagate metadata for streaming
                        sensor data," said Ives.
                     
                     
                     Said Sim: "The infrastructure will accommodate a wide variety of data types and will
                        enable data discovery, analytics, and visualization from third parties, including
                        researchers and industry."
                     
                     
                     Srivastava noted that "To address the privacy concerns associated with data from mobile
                        personal sensors, our team will also investigate privacy mechanisms to ensure privacy
                        of data contributors, while allowing research using their data."
                     
                     
                     University of Memphis President M. David Rudd added, "This $4 million grant represents
                        the largest single NSF award received by the University of Memphis and reflects our
                        growing reputation as a hub for mobile sensor 'big data' and mHealth research, as
                        well as Dr. Kumar's national and international reputation as a leader in this field."
                     
                     
                     "Earlier this year, Google cited the MD2K Center at the U of M as a reason why Memphis
                        was named the Digital e-Capital for Tennessee," said Dr. Andy Myers, Vice President
                        for Research at U of M. "The new mProv project builds upon the MD2K project, and further
                        enhances the University of Memphis' nationwide reputation as a hub for mHealth research."
