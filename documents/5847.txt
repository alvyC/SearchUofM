                        Drinkard is the Director of the Talent Development Complex. Born in Memphis and raised
                        in Hernando, Mississippi, Moriah was anxious to return to the Bluff City and pursue
                        a degree in music business at the University of Memphis. While earning her bachelor's
                        in music, she was blessed with many vast and wonderful opportunities to work within
                        the music community doing everything from local festivals to freelance artist management.
                        She spent the early part of her career blogging about music, coordinating live events,
                        and volunteering for GRAMMY U. Before joining the team at TCMMT, she spent most of
                        the past year managing crowdfunding projects, co-producing and marketing an album
                        and developing an online presence for local artists. More highlights from Moriah's
                        career include working alongside Director Martin Shore of the Memphis based documentary,
                        "Take Me to the River" during its showcase at the 2014 South by Southwest Conference. 
                        In addition she has had the opportunity to work with esteemed artists and industry
                        professionals such as Drake, Director X, and the Mitchell family of Royal Studios
                        on the making of the 2014 BET Best Hip Hop Award winning music video, "Worst Behavior".
                        Moriah feels privileged and honored to have met and worked with so many of Memphis'
                        most passionate music industry players and continues to do so today as part of The
                        Consortium MMT.

                        Fractured Atlas to pay the musicians.
