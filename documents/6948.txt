                     Repeating Chemistry Courses:
                     
                     Students must earn a grade of at least "C-" in all chemistry courses, other science
                        courses, and mathematics courses applied toward the major or minor. Chemistry courses
                        may be repeated twice if necessary to achieve a satisfactory grade. No student may
                        take a CHEM (or cross-listed) course more than three times in order to earn a minimum
                        grade of "C-" without the expressed written permission of the department chairperson.
                        To request such permission, complete this form , have it signed by your advisor, and submit it by email to pbridson@memphis.edu or
                        fax to 901-678-3447 prior to registering for the course.

                        Spring, Summer 1, and Summer 2, respectively) in which courses are usually taught.
                        Some courses are offered on an alternating basis, once every two years, even [E] or
                        odd [O] years: [EF], [ES], [OF], and [OS]. Some special topics courses (indicated
                        by [ST]) are offered on an irregular basis, usually not more frequently than once
                        every two years. Fall and spring courses offered at the Lambuth campus are indicated
                        by [LF] or [LS] respectively. For information on current course availability and to
