                           Database: Slavery in America and the World: History, Culture & Law Database Description: This HeinOnline collection brings together, for the first time, all known legal materials
                              on slavery in the United States and the English-speaking world. This includes every
                              statute passed by every colony and state on slavery, every federal statute dealing
                              with slavery, and all reported state and federal cases on slavery. Our cases go into
                              the 20th century, because long after slavery was ended, there were still court cases
                              based on issues emanating from slavery.
