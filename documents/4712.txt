                     Official University policies are located on the Policies and Procedures website.  All students, faculty, and staff are expected to comply with the policies
                        below that are designed to protect University IT resources.  All students, faculty,
                        and staff are encouraged to review and comply with the guidelines below to prevent
                        security incidents that could lead to a violation of University policies.

                     In compliance with University policy UM1691 - Campus Data Security Policy, restricted
                        University data must be protected against physical theft or loss, electronic invasion,
                        or unintentional exposure.  ITS has developed guidelines to recommend appropriate
                        storage services and locations to be utilized for the all classifications of University
                        data. Please refer to the Guidelines for Storage of University Electronic Data page for a listing of storage services and locations by data classification.
                     
                     
                     Data Encryption
                     
                     ITS has developed standards for encryption to ensure confidential data is protected
                        from disclosure. In compliance with University policy UM1691 - Campus Data Security
                        Policy, employees, in cooperation with their Local Support Provider (LSP), are responsible
                        for protecting restricted University data to which they have access. 
                     
                     
                     ITS has the following recommendations for encryption software:
                     
                     
                        
                        Windows 7 Enterprise: Microsoft Bitlocker (part of Windows 7 Enterprise) or Veracrypt .
                        
                        
                        Mac OS X: Apple File Vault
                        
                        Android: Android Device Encryption
                        
                        iOS: iOS Data Protection
                        
                     
                     
                     Web servers
                     
                     Web servers hosted on the University of Memphis network must adhere to established
                        system security guidelines and be maintained using system administration best practices
                        including keeping operating systems (OS) and server software patched, and removing
                        or disabling unnecessary services, applications, and ports. Only required web server
                        modules and/or extensions should be enabled.
                     
                     
                     Directory listing should be turned off so that search engines and web browsers can't
                        list and identify all of the files stored in the document root of the web server.
                     
                     
                     Web server logs must be maintained in a directory that is not web-accessible. Log
                        files should be reviewed regularly for signs of out-of-the-ordinary behavior.
                     
                     
                     Web site security
                     
                     Web pages that display or collect sensitive or confidential information must be hosted
                        on a secure server supporting an encrypted web protocol (https) with a digital certificate
                        issued by a trusted certificate authority. The University of Memphis ITS Web Services
                        group (webservices@memphis.edu) manages an account with a trusted root certification
                        authority and will work with clients from across campus who need to obtain an SSL
                        certificate for official department or unit web servers in the memphis.edu domain.
                     
                     
                     Scripts executed on Web servers are particularly prone to security breaches, especially
                        if they don't validate user-supplied data before accessing files or operating-system
                        services. Script code should be reviewed and scanned for known security risks.
                     
                     
                     Peer-to-Peer file sharing
                     
                     Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing allows individuals to share files with other users.
                        Additional information about P2P file sharing can be found in a Wikipedia article
                        located  here .  There are many potential legal issues surrounding inappropriate use of P2P applications
                        and users of these programs are encouraged to review and abide by applicable copyright
                        laws that can be reviewed here .  Violation of copyright laws or other inappropriate use of P2P file sharing may
                        result in a violation of policy UM1535 - Acceptable Use of Information Technology
                        Resources.   Sharing of some types of music, videos, movies, and documents are examples that may
                           constitute violations of University policy.
                     
                     Equipment Disposal
                     
                     In compliance with University policy UM1691 - Campus Data Security Policy, data should
                        be securely erased from equipment prior to disposal.  Deleting files from your computer
                        or laptop does not permanently remove the data. The hard drive must be overwritten
                        (sometimes called "wiping" the drive) before disposal to ensure that deleted files
                        cannot be recovered.  An example of a free program used to overwrite a computer or
                        laptop hard drive is Darik's Boot and Nuke (DBAN) .
                     
                     
                     Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act
                     
                     The University adheres to the requirements of the Family Educational and Privacy Rights
                        Act (FERPA).  Additional information regarding FERPA is located on the Registrar's website .
