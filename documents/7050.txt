                     Housing and Community Development Fellowship
                     The HCD Fellowship program is funded by the City of Memphis' Division of Housing and
                     Community Development and facilitated by the School of Urban Affairs and Public Policy
                     (SUAPP) at the University of Memphis. The competitive program places highly qualified
                     graduate students with government and nonprofit agencies and organizations that are
                     leading community development efforts in Memphis. The program seeks to support the
                     work of selected placement agencies while enhancing the education of selected student
                     fellows. Selected students are paired with a placement agency, where they work for
                     20 hours per week (at no cost to the placement agency).
