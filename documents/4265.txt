                           is how scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data be effectively used to develop personalized
                           instruction plan for children with development delays. Scalp EEG monitors synchronous
                           neuronal activities in the brain that relates to various degrees of cortical functions.
                           Multi-electrode EEG configurations (eg. International 10-20 system) allow source localization
                           in 3D space to identify the active brain region in temporal domain. The recorded signals
                           are classified in alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta, and mu waveforms based on frequency
                           contents. Beta waves (13 to 30 Hz) from frontal (and parietal) lobes are known to
                           intensify during alert, engaged and working state of the brain. This project develops
                           a wireless EEG system for easy and immediate feedback of children with developmental
                           delays. This is extra challenging to determine for children who have certain developmental
                           delays such as autism, cerebral palsy or other delays that make it difficult to see
                           typical responses. By recording EEG responses remotely, we expect to be able to identify
                           teaching strategies are the most effective for an individual child with severe development
                           delays.  Analysis of data will allow the formulation of personalized instruction plans
                           and improve classroom curriculum.
                     
                     Requirements for Student Applicants: Students must be prepared to work on programming
                           of the software for the wireless EEG system, data collection and analysis. Students
                           with previous experiences with programming languages (C++/Visual C/Visual Basic etc.),
                           Matlab, database software, and statistical analysis will be given preference. Adherence
                           to strict protocol, tidy record keeping, diligently, and good oral and written communication
                           skills are mandatory.
