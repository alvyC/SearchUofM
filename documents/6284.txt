                                 Mechanical alloying is a nonequilibrium processing method, originally developed to
                                    produce oxide dispersion strengthened alloys. it can be utilized to process large
                                    quantities of materials at relatively low cost. Mechanical alloying has been widely
                                    used to produce extremely fine microscturctures, amorphouse alloys, and rare earth
                                    permanent magnet materials.
