            Public Forum on Lessons Learned from the 2009  Christchurch New Zealand Earthquake, October 17, 2013
            The Central U.S. Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC), in partnership with several local, national,              and international disaster experts, hosted a public forum on Building Resiliency in the Face of the Earthquake              Risk on the campus of the University of Memphis on Thursday, October 17, 2013. The purpose of this event was to help increase earthquake awareness and preparedness efforts              among those living and working in the central U.S. and to explain vulnerabilities that may impact post-earthquake            recovery for communities affected by the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ).
