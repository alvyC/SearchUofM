                     University of Memphis Symphony Orchestra
                     
                     
                           The University of Memphis Symphony Orchestra (UMSO) offers study and performance opportunities
                        for music majors pursuing bachelor's to doctoral degrees and for non-majors. The UMSO
                        has about 85 members. Approximately two-thirds are undergraduate and one-third are
                        graduate students. Professor Pu-Qi Jiang, D.M.A., has been the director and principal
                        conductor of the UMSO since 2000. The UofM Symphony Orchestra was Second Prize Winner
                        in the American Prize Orchestral Performance Competition (College/University) 2011.
                        The orchestra performs at least two symphonic concerts and one chamber orchestra concert
                        on campus each semester. The UMSO's repertoire includes compositions written for full
                        orchestra, chamber orchestra, opera and concerto performances. Recent concerts have
                        included Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, Berlioz's
                        Symphonie Fantastique, Hindemith's Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by C. M. von
                        Weber, Mahler's symphonies, and works by Barber, Beethoven, Copland, Dvorak, Mendelssohn,
                        Mozart, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky and others. In addition, orchestra
                        members perform in University Opera productions and have the opportunity to play with
                        many professional organizations in Memphis and the Mid-South. More than 12 former
                        and current UMSO members are contracted to play with the Memphis Symphony Orchestra
                        and many others play regularly with other orchestras in the Mid-South region. Many
                        members of the UMSO have joined the School's orchestral concert tours to perform in
                        European countries and China. The UMSO supports aspiring young students by premiering
                        their compositions, accompanying winners of the annual UofM Soloists' Competition
                        and offers significant podium time to student conductors. Most orchestral conducting
                        major students go on to professional careers as conductors, professors, opera coaches
                        and D.M.A. candidates. Positions in the UMSO are filled by audition at the beginning
                        of each semester. A limited number of scholarships are available. For more information,
                        please contact the conductor, Dr. Pu-Qi Jiang by email or at 901.678.3775.
