                     Please keep the Responsible Printing Initiative in mind when printing.
                     
                     The Responsible Printing Initiative (RPI) is an SGA/ITS cooperative designed to fairly
                        distribute printing resources, reduce waste and eliminate abuse.
                     
                     
                     Printing utilizes more than just paper. Printing costs cover the following:
