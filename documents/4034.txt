                     1. Transfer Credit for Previous Instruction
                     
                     Credit from post-secondary institutions will be granted and applied toward degree
                        requirements only when it is for courses that are substantially equivalent to those
                        offered at the University of Memphis. Credit not equivalent to courses at the University
                        of Memphis may be posted to the student's record and may be used as elective credit
                        or as determined by the dean of the college from which the student is to graduate.
                        After the student has been approved for admission as a regular undergraduate, the
                        Office of Admissions will evaluate credit for University-wide use. The office of the
                        dean in each college has the authority for determining the use of acceptable credit
                        toward specific degree programs in that college.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis accepts transfer credit for college-level courses taken
                        at accredited institutions of higher education. Student petitions for transfer credit
                        for courses completed at institutions that are not regionally accredited are considered
                        on a case-by-case basis. The student must present a petition in writing to the Office
                        of Admissions at the University of Memphis with a list of courses for which credit
                        is desired. The student must provide transcripts from the institutions, documentation
                        from each course that includes the course content, course level, contact minutes,
                        the standards for assessing student work, and documentation of the academic credentials
                        of the course instructor. Based on an examination of these materials and after consultation
                        with the appropriate academic department or college, the Office of Admissions will
                        review the student's petition and provide confirmation of those courses that have
                        been approved for transfer credit.
                     
                     
                      2. Earning Transfer Credit after Enrollment at the University of Memphis
                     
                     University of Memphis students considering taking courses at other institutions should
                        consult the transfer articulation tables to see how the course will transfer to the University of Memphis. All enrolled students
                        must have Section I of the T ransfer Credit Request completed by the student. For institutions and courses that are not listed on those
                        tables, students must complete Sections I-II of this form before enrolling in the
                        course to find out whether the course will transfer to the University of Memphis and
                        how it will count toward their degree programs. An approved Transfer Credit Request
                        serves as assurance that the course will transfer and how it will count toward the
                        desired requirement. Students do not have any guarantee that courses not listed on
                        the articulation tables will transfer or how they will count toward the students'
                        degrees without an approved Transfer Credit Request form.
                     
                     
                     Before credit earned at another institution can be transferred and recorded on a permanent
                        academic record, the student must have an official transcript from the institution
                        mailed to the Admissions Office.
                     
                     
                     The maximum credit hour load allowed for any term includes all course enrollments
                        both at the University of Memphis and any concurrent enrollment at other institutions.
                        (See "Credit Hours and Maximum Load")
                     
                     
                     3. Transfer Credit for Distance Education
                     
                     Credit from other institutions for distance education courses taught by independent
                        study, on-line computer instruction, or other methods, is evaluated in the same manner
                        as transfer credit for classroom-based instruction. As with other transfer credit,
                        students enrolled as regular undergraduates must seek prior approval from the dean
                        of the college from which they are to graduate before taking courses to meet degree
                        requirements at the University of Memphis.
