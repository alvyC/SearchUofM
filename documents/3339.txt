                     The Interfraternity Council at the University of Memphis is the governing body for
                           10 men's fraternities. The Interfraternity Council is dedicated to the academic and
                           social development of its respective fraternities and their members. Members in IFC
                           organizations are active in every aspect of campus. With a diverse array of fraternities,
                           each with its own unique qualities, there is a perfect fit for each individual looking
                           to join a fraternity in the council.
