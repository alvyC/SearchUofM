                        and their accomplishments by participating in the many events happening during the
                        month of March!
                     
                     
                     Congress declared March Women's History Month in 1987. The month is dedicated to celebrating
                        women—both in history and today—who have made a difference through action. These women
                        range from everyday heroes such as mothers and teachers to historical women such as
                        Memphian Ida B. Wells-Barnett who worked to end segregation and racism and Frances
                        Perkins who was the first woman to hold a position in the President's Cabinet.
                     
                     
                     Before the celebration of women's history lasted an entire month, it was only a week.
                        In 1980, President Jimmy Carter made an address designating March 2-8 of that year
                        Women's History Week. In his speech, he said, "As Dr. Gerda Lerner has noted, 'Women's
                        History is Women's Right.' – It is an essential and indispensable heritage from which
                        we can draw pride, comfort, courage, and long-range vision."
