                     Congress declared March Women's History Month in 1987. The month is dedicated to celebrating
                        womenâboth in history and todayâwho have made a difference through action. These women
                        range from everyday heroes such as mothers and teachers to historical women such as
                        Memphian Ida B. Wells-Barnett who worked to end segregation and racism and Frances
                        Perkins who was the first woman to hold a position in the President's Cabinet.
                     
                     
                     Before the celebration of women's history lasted an entire month, it was only a week.
                        In 1980, President Jimmy Carter made an address designating March 2-8 of that year
                        Women's History Week. In his speech, he said, "As Dr. Gerda Lerner has noted, 'Women's
                        History is Women's Right.' â It is an essential and indispensable heritage from which
                        we can draw pride, comfort, courage, and long-range vision."
