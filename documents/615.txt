                     There are many ways to approach preparation for the LSAT. Since all LSAT scores are
                        included on the Credential Assembly Service (CAS) report, applicants are encouraged
                        to prepare and not to take the exam cold. More information on preparing for the LSAT
                        can be found online through LSAC . LSAC publications, including those listed below, can be ordered online or at 215-968-1001.

                     Admission Criteria
                     
                     Our admissions process seeks those applicants with the greatest chance for success,
                        both in their education and in their future careers. As a result, admission into the
                        University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphrey's School of Law is competitive. Each year
                        we receive and process approximately 1,000 applications. These applicants are competing
                        for 150 seats in the entering class.
                     
                     
                     A significant factor in the admission process is the "admission index," which is based
                        on the applicant's undergraduate grade point average and the applicant's highest Law
                        School Admission Test (LSAT) score. The undergraduate grade point average used in
                        the admissions index is the cumulative grade point average found on the CAS report
                        as calculated by the Law School Admission Council. While the admission index uses
                        the highest LSAT score, if an applicant has taken the LSAT more than once he or she
                        is encouraged to explain, in a statement, any variance in their LSAT scores.
                     
                     
                     Also considered are factors deemed to be predictive of success in law school as set
                        forth in the application may include, but are not limited to, overall academic record,
                        extracurricular activities, community involvement, employment, and other life experiences.
                        Applicants are encouraged to submit letters of recommendation addressing their potential
                        for academic success.
                     
                     
                     As a publicly assisted institution of the state, Tennessee residents may be given
                        preference in selection; however, non-resident applicants are encouraged to apply
                        and must submit a separate statement detailing reasons for wanting to attend the University
                        of Memphis School of Law.
                     
                     
                     Memphis Law recognizes the benefits of diversity in the classroom. We endeavor to
                        create a student body representative of a wide range of social, economic, racial and
                        ethnic backgrounds and experiences. In the personal statement, applicants are encouraged
                        to identify ways in which they may contribute to the diversity of Memphis Law.
