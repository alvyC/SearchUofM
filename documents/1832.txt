                     Women's History Month at UofM Will Spotlight "Can Do" Spirit
                     
                     February 24, 2016- Women's History Month at the University of Memphis will be a University-wide
                        collaboration of faculty, staff and student-planned programs designed to celebrate
                        the accomplishments of women in the past and present and to inspire women for the
                        future. The theme for 2016 is "We Can Do It," which was chosen because it aligns with
                        the UofM's "Driven by Doing" motto while calling to mind the "Rosie the Riveters"
                        of the past and present. 
                     
                     
                     A calendar of events is available at memphis.edu/whm . Highlights of the month-long program include the Women's History Month Opening Feb.
                        29 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the University Center Atrium.  The opening will include
                        a "feminist fair" of resources and topics of interest to women, an "I Can Do It" Instagram
                        frame where women can be photographed testifying to their goals, and a feminist interpretation
                        of Michelangelo Pistoletto's "Sculpture for Strolling" in which feminist issues in
                        print are converted into a papier-mâché sculpture, part of the "Do It" series of exhibits
                        sponsored by the University of Memphis Art Museum. 
                     
                     
                     Other events during the month include a Choosing Transportation conference March 3-4;
                        a screening and discussion of The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter March 17; "The Life of Frances Dancy Hooks" discussion March 23; "Women in Words: A
                        Reading and Panel Discussion" March 24; and "Women and Post-Civil War Racial Violence
                        – The 1866 Memphis Massacre," a lecture by Dr. Beverly Bond, March 25.   
                     
                     
                     Throughout the month, donations will be collected for Clio's Closet, a resource for
                        UofM students in need of non-perishable food, toiletries, clothing and baby necessities. Donations
                        will be accepted at most Women's History Month events and at Mitchell Hall, room 130.
                        Women's History Month T-shirts will also be available for purchase at key events,
                        including the opening ($20, $15 for UofM students with ID).
                     
                     
                     The Women's History Month closing program, April 1 from 1 to 2:30 p.m., will feature
                        Terri Lee Freeman, president of the National Civil Rights Museum, and will recognize
                        women honored for their "We Can Do It" spirit. UofM faculty, staff and students can
                        complete a recognition form at memphis.edu/whm until March 25. The honoree will receive a personal invitation to the closing, a
                        commemorative pin, and will be recognized in a presentation during the ceremony.
