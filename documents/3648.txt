                     The Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law Black Law Students Association (BLSA) recently
                        honored law students at The Kenneth Maurice Cox Donning of the Kente Ceremony which
                        was held Friday, May 13th, 2016. This ceremony was initiated in 2007 and recognizes
                        each graduating BLSA member for their contribution to the law school's academic, cultural,
                        and professional environment. It is also named in honor of one of the law school's
                        first African-American graduates, Kenneth Maurice Cox. This year's ceremony marked
                        the 50th anniversary of Kenneth Cox's graduation from the then Memphis State University
                        School of Law. The guest speaker for this event was Attorney Ricky Wilkins.

                     The National Black Law Students Association (BLSA) is the nation's largest student-run
                        organization representing nearly 6,000 minority law students from over 200 chapters
                        and affiliates throughout the United States. Since its foundation in 1966, BLSA has
                        sought to promote the professional needs of African-American and minority law students
                        by promoting professional competence and increasing awareness of the needs of the
                        community.
                     
                     
                     The Benjamin L. Hooks Chapter of BLSA at the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law is devoted
                        to providing opportunities and benefits for students and the community. BLSA membership
                        is available to all University of Memphis School of Law students and provides its
                        members with professional networking opportunities, professional and academic mentorship,
                        social engagement, and the opportunity to participate in community service and pro
                        bono activities. In addition, the BLSA Thurgood Marshall Mock Trial Team and Frederick
                        Douglass Moot Court Team continue to succeed and compete in the Southern Region BLSA
                        competitions, as well as in national competitions.
