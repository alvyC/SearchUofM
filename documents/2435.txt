                     GoGrad Ranks Two UofM Online Master's Programs In Top 10
                     
                     June 3, 2015 - GoGrad, an online resource for affordable online graduate programs,
                        has ranked two University of Memphis programs among its top 10 online master's degrees.
                        The UofM's online master's degree in environmental nutrition was ranked No. 2 while
                        the online master's in history was rated No. 10.
                     
                     
                     GoGrad calculated its rankings using a rigorous process based on the following data:
                        number of online degrees offered in a related area, graduate tuition, availability
                        of academic and career counseling services, access to job placement services and peer-based
                        value.
                     
                     
                     "While we are the largest graduate school in the Mid-South with more than 4,000 students
                        in 114 doctoral, master's and graduate certificate programs, our strategic plans includes
                        use of the latest online learning technologies and best practices to expand the market
                        for our quality programs while providing convenience for our students," said UofM
                        Provost Karen Weddle-West. "We want to be national leaders in these areas, and I congratulate
                        the faculty of the environmental nutrition and history programs for their success."
