                     The Fogelman Honors Program
                     
                     What is special about the Fogelman Honors Program?  We assign our best, most student-friendly
                           instructors to teach honors courses.
                     
                     We make an effort to limit enrollment in honors courses, so that students can more
                        effectively interact with their instructors and classmates.  Associating with other
                        smart, hard-working, and ambitious students brings out the best in you.  Friendships
                        made in honors courses last a lifetime.
                     
                     
                     Honors instructors use a variety of techniques, including guest speakers, student
                        involvement in research activities, field trips, group projects, and the application
                        of skills learned in class to the solution of real-world business and social problems,
                        to provide an enriching educational experience.
                     
                     
                     Honors students are encouraged to participate in the MILE program, Toastmasters, and
                        the numerous other “beyond the classroom” experiences that are provided by the Fogelman
                        College of Business and Economics.  They are assisted in applying for scholarships
                        and internships.
                     
                     
                     Students may participate in the Fogelman Honors Program while participating in the
                        Helen Hardin University Honors Program.
                     
                     
                     What are the requirements for participating in the Fogelman Honors Program? Incoming freshmen with a 27 or better on the ACT or the equivalent on other tests
                        are eligible to enroll in the Fogelman College’s lower-division honors courses.  Transfer
                        students or students currently enrolled in The University of Memphis are eligible
                        to enroll in the college’s lower-division honors courses if they have an overall g.p.a.
                        of at least 3.0 or the recommendation of a faculty member.  Students must have a g.p.a.
                        of at least 3.25 in all Business courses and an overall g.p.a. of at least 3.0 to
                        enroll in upper-division honors courses offered by the Fogelman College.  Retention
                        in the honors program requires that a student maintain at least a 3.0 overall g.p.a.
                        and at least a 3.25 g.p.a. in all Business courses.  In order to receive honors credit
                        for any Business course, a grade of at least “B” is required.
                     
                     
                     Do I receive recognition for participation in the Fogelman Honors Program?
                     
                     “Honors in Business and Economics” will appear on your transcript and diploma if you
                        complete the required number of Business honors courses with a grade of at least “B”,
                        maintain the required g.p.a. in Business courses and the required overall g.p.a.,
                        and either write an honors thesis or participate in two honors experiences approved
                        by the Director of the Fogelman Honors Program.  The specifics of these requirements
                        can be obtained from the Director of the Fogelman Honors Program.  Students who do
                        not meet these requirements, but have completed a minimum of four Business honors
                        courses with a grade of at least “B” in each, will receive a “Certificate of Achievement”
                        in Business Honors.
