                     Email Submission Instructions
Upon completing and submitting the Transfer Credit Request form, you will be presented a " Select Email Client " window (see below) .  You will need to select one of the two options before proceeding.
Option 1 .  If you are completing and submitting the Transfer Credit Request form from a computer running an e-mail application (i.e. Outlook) , select the first option ( Desktop Email Application ). This option will open an new e-mail message with the To: field, Subject: field, and message already filled in, and the TCR.pdf file attached. Press send.
Option 2 .  If you are completing and submitting the Transfer Credit Request form from a computer without an e-mail application account configured on the computer, you will need to select the second option ( Internet Email ).  This option will allow you to save the file on the local drive (save the file as TCR.pdf) .  Once you've saved the file, you will need to open your web-based e-mail (i.e. ummail , gmail , yahoo , etc...) and address a new e-mail message to admissions@memphis.edu and attach the saved file to the e-mail. If the computer you are using is publicly accessible (i.e. Tigerlan) , you are advised to delete the file immediately after sending.
