                     Abstract:
                     
                     Our project will continue work from a previous NSF Minerva grant Modeling Discourse
                        and Social Dynamics in Authoritarian Regimes (#0904909) to analyze the speech of international
                        actors to detect motives, identify threats, and find predictive patterns of language
                        and behavior. Our project has three components: identifying language patterns related
                        to armed political crises; identifying bluffs and threats pertinent to both national
                        and international security; and analyzing the relationship between language and contentious
                        behavior like protests, riots, and rebellions. We want to extend our analysis beyond
                        the existing corpora which focus heavily on China and the Middle East/North Africa
                        regions to encompass Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, where there are growing
                        security threats and ample opportunities to collect and analyze linguistic data. http://minerva.dtic.mil/funded.html
