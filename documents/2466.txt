                        As an alumnus and/or friend of the SHS you can partner with us to provide an impact
                        in numerous ways:
                     
                     
                     • You can invest in the SHS by making a tax deductable gift . Your investments support academic scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students,
                        summer research fellowships for graduate students, and laboratory and equipment upgrades
                        to support cutting edge research. You may direct your gift to any area within the
                        SHS. 
                     
                     
                     • Serve on our advisory board. Your experience is invaluable and can help us expand
                        our academic and research mission by connecting with important organizations and people.
                     
                     
                     • Provide internships for our students. All undergraduate students within the SHS
                        are required to complete an internship experience prior to graduation. This requires
                        that a significant number of qualified internship sites be available for our students
                        to choose from. Please contact Dr. Stan Walls , Internship Coordinator in SHS, to learn how you can partner with us.
                     
                     
                     • Share your expertise by providing a guest lecture in a certain class or classes.
                        Sharing your expertise with students is the most direct way to impact students' career
                        development.
                     
                     
                     • Mentor students. Through classroom participation or one-on-one mentoring, our students
                        seek and require your network, influence, and experience.
                     
                     
                     • Hire our graduates.
                     
                     With your engagement and gifts we can greatly enrich our college and support our community.
                        Alumni and friends are the difference between a good and great school.
