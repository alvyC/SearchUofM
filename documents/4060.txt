                     Privacy Rights of Parents and Students
                     
                     The University complies fully with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
                        of 1974. This act is designed to protect the privacy of educational records, to establish
                        the right of students to inspect and review their educational records, and to provide
                        guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and
                        formal hearings. Students also have the right to file complaints with the FERPA Office
                        concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the Act.
                     
                     
                     Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a student's
                        name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates
                        of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory
                        information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to
                        request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must
                        notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual
                        means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook,
                        or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.
