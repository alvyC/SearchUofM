                        Dr. Yang is motivated to examine how the human's health-related behaviors including
                           physical activities are influenced by the built and social environments, to estimate
                           the corresponding impacts on humans' health, and to provide implications for policy
                           interventions. Dr. Yang's research is based on the integration of methodologies from
                           epidemiology, systems science, and geography.
