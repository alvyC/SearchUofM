                     When women work together for the good of our university and our community, we are
                        an unparalleled force for change. It was the women of the Nineteenth Century Club
                        who first crusaded to establish a four-year women's college in Memphis. Those efforts
                        ultimately led to the University's founding in 1912.
                     
                     
                     Today, the commitment of our alumnae and friends is more important than ever to the
                        success of the university and our students. Our commitment to enhancing opportunities
                        for women and supporting the next generation of leaders to their full potential led
                        to the launch of Women in Leadership & Philanthropy. The mission of the WLP is to
                        connect women as leaders and philanthropists who will work together to make a positive
                        difference on our campuses and throughout our community.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Unite the female leaders of today with those of tomorrow.
