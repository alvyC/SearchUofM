                     March 30, 2015 - Richard Bloomer, professor and chair of Health and Sport Sciences
                        at the University of Memphis, has received a grant from IN-Ingredients to direct a
                        clinical study evaluating the sleep benefits of a novel plant-based dietary supplement.
                     
                     
                     Millions of individuals suffer from poor sleep quality, and many turn to prescription
                        medications to help get a good night's rest. Unfortunately, there are few natural
                        alternatives available that have been shown to improve the quality or quantity of
                        sleep. The study will test the effectiveness of two plant-based ingredients on sleep
                        quality in men and women.
                     
                     
                     Investigators are recruiting healthy, non-smoking men and women between the ages of
                        18 and 65 to participate in this study. To be eligible to participate, individuals
                        must report at least one of following: routine difficulty falling asleep; frequent
                        waking (more than twice) during the night; routinely having bad dreams; restless sleep
                        (tossing and turning throughout the night); or waking in the morning feeling tired.
                     
                     
                     Participants will be given either a supplement or a placebo for a four weeks, and
                        measures of sleep quality will be collected throughout the study period. They will
                        be paid $200 upon full completion of the study.
                     
                     
                     Those interested in participating or learning more should contact Jay MacDonnchadh
