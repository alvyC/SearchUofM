                        Dr. Thomas Watson joined the Department as an assistant professor in Fall 2016. Before
                           that, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto. He earned his
                           Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 2013 and
                           was supported by an NSF graduate research fellowship.
                        
                        
                        Dr. Watson's research focuses on computational complexity theory, especially on communication
                           complexity and on the role of randomness in computation. His work has been published
                           in top theory venues, such as STOC, FOCS, ITCS, CCC, ICALP, and SICOMP. Several of
                           his conference papers have been invited to special journal issues. He received a Best
                           Student Paper Award from ITCS'13, and has given invited talks at workshops at Dagstuhl
                           and Banff.
