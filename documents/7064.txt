                           Dr. Pezeshk's research interests encompass all phases of engineering seismology and
                              earthquake engineering; in particular, ground motion prediction, site effects, site
                              characterization, probabilistic seismic hazard analyses, and strong ground motions
                              and their impact on structures.
                           
                           
                           Dr. Pezeshk has also a long record of research in structural optimization, in particular,
                              performance-based structural optimization.
                           
                           
                           Dr. Pezeshk's research in Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) has been implemented
                              in the USGS hazard maps 2008 and 2014:
