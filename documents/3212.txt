                     Service on Saturday
                     
                     This monthly program, sponsored by the Civic Engagement Board, is designed to give
                        students, staff, and faculty a quick and easy way to volunteer in the community with
                        no long-term commitment. The program typically offers about 6-12 different community
                        service opportunities to choose from. Participants who sign up in advance online get
                        their first choice of these projects. The program generally begins at 8:30 am with
                        free breakfast and ends around 12:00 - 1:00 pm with free lunch.

                        Memphis community. Varying by month, students will have the chance to work with a
                        number of agencies in Memphis that focus on a range of social justice issues.
