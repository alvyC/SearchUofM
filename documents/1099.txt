                     April 1, 2015 - The University of Memphis Research Foundation (UMRF) has been granted
                        United States patent No. 8,993,540, "Compositions and Methods for Delivering an Agent
                        to a Wound." It is the 20th patent granted to UMRF. The product covered by this patent
                        was invented in the University of Memphis Herff College Of Engineering's Department
                        of Biomedical Engineering (BME). The inventors are Dr. Warren Haggard and Dr. Joel
                        Bumgardner, both professors of BME, and Dr. Scott Noel of Bionova Medical, who earned
                        his PhD under Haggard's supervision.
                     
                     
                     The patent is exclusively licensed to Bionova Medical, a privately held medical device
                        company in Germantown, Tenn. The company's flagship product, Sentrex BioSponge MPD,
                        covered by this new patent, has received two clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug
                        Administration for use as a local wound management device that is also compatible
                        with Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT).
                     
                     
                     "We are very pleased to receive a patent on this exciting technology that is based
                        on cutting-edge science from our researchers," said University President M. David
                        Rudd. "It validates the real-world impact of the work of our researchers in the Herff
                        College of Engineering, and demonstrates the leading role played by the FedEx Institute
                        in bridging the gap between the lab and the marketplace."
                     
                     
                     Dr. Jasbir Dhaliwal, executive director of the FedEx Institute of Technology and chief
                        innovation officer of the University, said, "The FedEx Institute has been hard at
                        work building up its portfolio of technology patents and intellectual property by
                        supporting basic research and development of proof-of-concepts underlying innovations
                        such as this would care device. We are now ready to work with regional biomedical
                        partners to commercialize these innovations."
                     
                     
                     The Sentrex BioSponge MPD has been used in medical centers around the country to aid
                        in local management of a variety of wound types. Brian Austin, CEO of Bionova Medical,
                        said, "We appreciate the opportunity to provide physicians with a device, utilizing
                        this novel technology from the University of Memphis, that helps them manage complex
                        wounds."
