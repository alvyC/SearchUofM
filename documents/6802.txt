                     When an innovative product is introduced into the market, consumers are often uncertain
                        about the product value. Over time they may learn the value of product. This paper
                        studies the impact of consumer learning on the firms' marketing efforts and revenue
                        sharing strategies in a supply chain that sells an innovative product to consumers
                        over multiple periods. Both the supplier and the retailer can exert marketing efforts
                        to influence consumers' beliefs about the product and improve the product demand.
                        Because the supplier and the retailer are independent entities with self-interested
                        objectives, double moral hazard exists in the supply chain. We find that the supplier
                        and retailer exert more marketing efforts in the presence of consumer learning but
                        the marketing efforts decrease as consumers learn more about the product. We also
                        examine the revenue-sharing strategies and find that supplier shares more revenue
                        to the retailer when they cooperate for a longer time horizon. The total profit of
                        the supply chain may be higher when there is information asymmetry between the supplier
                        and retailer. This finding suggests that information sharing is not always beneficial
                        to improve supply chain coordination.
