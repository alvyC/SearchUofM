                     Prospective students should check with the department program coordinator of the program
                           to which they are applying for specific deadlines and requirements. Applicants should
                           allow a reasonable amount of time for necessary documents to be processed by the degree
                           program and the Graduate School (approximately four to six weeks). International applicants
                           should allow at least four months for the application process. Applicants are urged
                           to apply early to ensure consideration. Contact the ICL department about any requirements
                           and deadlines.
                     
                     If you have previously attended The University of Memphis Graduate School and have
                           not been enrolled for a semester, excluding summer, you must apply for readmission.
                           Readmission may subject the student to all of the rules, prerequisites, and degree
                           requirements listed in the current Graduate Catalog. Submission of an application
                           for readmission does not ensure acceptance. Readmission may be denied or conditions
                           may be imposed on the student. Contact the Graduate Office of Admissions and follow the specified procedures.
