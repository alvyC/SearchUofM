                        Intelligent Tutoring Systems."  ICSLE is an upcoming leading conference in the area
                        of learning technologies with a highly competitive acceptance rate which this year
                        was at 23% for full papers.
                     
                     
                     Drs. Rus and Stefanescu's research findings will have significant impact on the development
                        of future learning technologies that are more effective and more engaging.  Their
                        study showed that it is possible to accurately monitor students' prior knowledge level
                        with respect to a target domain based solely on characteristics of the natural language
                        interaction between students and state-of-the-art conversational intelligent tutoring
                        systems.  That means the the proposed method could be used to non-intrusively monitor
                        students' performance and therefore allow for appropriate feedback, and eliminate
                        explicit tests which are time-consuming and often cause anxiety for students.
