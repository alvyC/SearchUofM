                     PAINTING
                     
                     Painting at the U of M is taught within the broader cultural, historical, and contemporary
                        context in which art is made and experienced. Within this context, our undergraduate
                        and graduate students have a rigorous experience in the discipline of painting. Instruction
                        in oil, acrylic, watercolor, and other media, as well as opportunities for mixed media
                        exploration with other areas, is combined with an investigation and discussion of
                        art theory and contemporary issues. Small classes allow students to develop personal
                        interests, aesthetics, and thinking skills. Our faculty and visiting artists provide
                        both group and individual attention through lectures, demonstrations, discussions,
                        and critiques.
                     
                     
                     Students are introduced to a variety of techniques and principles about the nature
                        of painting with the intention of encouraging individual exploration. Undergraduate
                        painting students are required to take courses in the other fine art concentrations.
                        Because contemporary art frequently takes the form of multimedia works, painting students
                        often create works that incorporate other art media such as collage, photography,
                        drawing, sculpture, digital imagery, and installation.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     PRINTMAKING
                     
                     The undergraduate printmaking program at the U of M exposes students to a concentrated
                        fine art program of both practice and theory designed to provide the foundation for
                        later independent exploration and artistic development. We believe that it is fundamentally
                        important — intellectually, conceptually, and technically — that undergraduate students
                        have a comprehensive educational experience. The size of the department guarantees
                        an exposure to many ideas and stylistic approaches, while flexibility within our curriculum
                        allows for personal direction and development. In-depth exploration in a variety of
                        media and technical training enables students to become skilled in crafting and presenting
                        work. Classroom discussions provide the opportunity to examine a range of contemporary,
                        theoretical, and historical issues that enable the understanding of artwork with a
                        broad context.
                     
                     
                     The printmaking studios are well equipped for specialized and cross-disciplinary focus
                        in all of the traditional processes including woodcut, metal-plate intaglio, screen
                        printing, lithography, and alternative process photo methods. Hand-worked and photographically-developed
                        approaches are instructed in all media and digitally-produced images are fully explored.
                        Intermediate classes explore these processes in-depth with an emphasis on understanding
                        the relationship of technique and concept.
                     
                     
                     Advanced courses in printmaking focus on new technology as it relates to traditional
                        print processes. In addition, students are encouraged to combine and interchange the
                        various printmaking processes.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                       SCULPTURE
                     
                     In the 3-D areas, students discover the broad scope of form in space. They explore
                        a variety of means through which ideas and inspiration are conceptualized in sculpture
                        and ceramics. Contemporary trends and evaluations of artistic development are woven
                        into class projects.
                     
                     
                     Assignments challenge creativity as well as provide a basic understanding of the different
                        tools, materials, and techniques which are used to communicate through three-dimensional
                        form. Undergraduates share and interact with graduate students in large studios which
                        are equipped for welding metals, modeling and firing works in clay, casting in permanent
                        materials, and constructing in wood.
                     
                     
                     The horizons of sculpture have grown to include different kinds of art production,
                        resulting in a broadening of aesthetic concepts. In response to contemporary trends,
                        sculpture as an art form is redefining itself to include environments, installations,
                        and new media. Our graduate and undergraduate sculpture programs are designed to encourage
                        the exploration of the broadest possibilities of individual expression as well as
                        the investigation and understanding of contemporary art issues. Students are challenged
                        to excel in their production and in the articulation of concepts and concerns that
                        affect and form their work.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     CERAMICS
                     
                     In Ceramics, students learn new and traditional techniques in clay and glaze technology,
                        expanding their knowledge in the use of clay, glaze, and slips in the building and
                        decorating of pottery and ceramic sculpture. The use of gas and electric kilns, and
                        other equipment, are included in the program.
