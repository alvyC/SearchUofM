                     Research
                     
                     Current research at MBS emphasizes multidisciplinary realms of inquiry. Our approaches
                        are organized mostly in terms of collaborative or integrative syntheses, rather than
                        separate disciplines. Such a perspective is critical for a more informed understanding
                        the biocomplexity of ecological and evolutionary phenomena. The scientists involved
                        in defining the research vision of MBS are committed to these values and to a comprehensive
                        research program where participants will be flexible, broader, and more skilled at
                        collaborative, multidisciplinary, and group research rather than strict approaches
                        along disciplinary lines. This tradition has been firmly established by MBS Director
                        and has considerably improved the caliber of research and training programs at MBS.
