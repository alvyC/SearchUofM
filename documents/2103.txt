                     Our Summer term consists of several "parts of term." Visit Parts of Term to understand the differences.
                     
                     
                     Transfer Credit
                     
                     If you're taking a course for your own personal interest or benefit, then this step
                        is not a great consideration for you. However, if you're taking a course to apply
                        toward your degree, check with your university to see if it will accept the UofM course
                        as the equivalent of one of its own. It's up to your university, not UofM, to determine if our course will satisfy your
                           degree requirements.
                     
                     Our Undergraduate and Graduate course descriptions can be found online. If your university wants to see a course
                        syllabus, you will have to contact the instructor or the department offering the course.
                        Departmental web page links can be found here .
                     
                     
                     Admission
                     
                     Since you are not pursuing a degree here, apply for admission as Non-Degree Seeking . This means that, once admitted, you will not have to be advised by a UofM advisor. However, it also means that you cannot actually
                        register until April 15, 2015 .
                     
                     
                     Your Transcript from Your Home Institution
                     
                     As a visiting student, you aren't required to send us a copy of your transcript when
                        you apply. However, any course you want to take here may require proof of your having
                        met course prerequisites at your home university. For this reason, we strongly suggest
                        that you send a copy of your transcript, even unofficial, to our Admissions Office when you apply.
                     
                     
                     Registration
                     
                     Register for classes through the myMemphis portal. Refer to this Registration Quick Guide once you have been admitted and have established your portal Password (instructions
                        will be mailed to you by Admissions).
                     
                     
                     Fees and Fee Payment
                     
                     Visit the Bursar's website for information on fees, payment deadlines, and methods of payment.
                     
                     Transferring Credit to Your Home Institution
                     
                     To transfer your credit home, request an official UofM transcript. (You do not have to wait until the end of Summer to do this: submit your request
                        early and indicate that you want the transcript sent once Summer grades are official.)
