                     Teachers Learning in Networked Communities (TLINC) seeks to develop novice teachers'
                        reflective practice in a professional community. TLINC is a free online social and
                        professional networking community for teachers. It is supported by very generous grant
                        funding and is completely non-commercial. TLINC meets real needs for social and professional
                        support among new and experienced educators. TLINC is like "Facebook for teachers".
                        Teachers can create a classroom for their students (which is safe and secure), collaborate
                        with teachers all over the world, be a mentor, find a mentor, and talk about real
                        issues that affect their job performance. TLINC partners include the University of
                        Memphis, the University of Colorado at Denver, the University of Washington, and the
                        National Commission on Teaching and America's Future (NCTAF).
