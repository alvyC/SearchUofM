                     General Fitting Guidelines:
                     
                     This uniform is designed to be loose fitting. A tight fit reduces airflow needed for
                        ventilation and cooling. The coat will be worn outside the trousers and the trousers
                        will be worn with the issued belt. The coat will not extend below the top of the cargo
                        pocket on the pants and will not be any higher than the bottom of the side pocket
                        on the pants. The trousers will be worn bloused using the draw cords or blousing rubbers
                        if the trousers are not tucked into the boots. Trouser legs will not be wrapped around
                        the leg so tight as to present a pegged appearance.

                     The beret is worn so that the headband (edge binding) is straight across the forehead,
                        1 inch above the eyebrows. The flash is positioned over the left eye, and the excess
                        material is draped over to the right ear, extending to at least the top of the ear,
                        and no lower than the middle of the ear. Personnel will cut off the ends of the adjusting
                        ribbon and secure the ribbon knot inside the edge binding at the back of the beret.
                        When worn properly, the beret is formed to the shape of the head; therefore,Â Cadets
                        may not wear hairstyles that cause distortion of the beret.
