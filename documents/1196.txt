Young Alumni Legacy Scholarship
The deadline to apply for the 2016-2017 Young Alumni Legacy Scholarship has passed.

This $500 scholarship is funded by Young Alumni to help deserving UofM graduates or
professional-degree seeking students, who received an undergraduate degree at the
UofM, in their studies.

It is the long-term goal of Young Alumni to see this scholarship endowed so that it
can be permanently in place to help future graduate students of the UofM. We would
like to encourage you to make a contribution, large or small, to the Young Alumni
Legacy Scholarship so that we can reach our goal of endowment as soon as possible.
To make a contribution online, please visit www.memphis.edu/development/give.php , click the "other" button and enter "Young Alumni Legacy Scholarship" when prompted.


Join the Tiger Scholarship Fund!
Recent graduates within the last five years have the opportunity to join the Tiger
Scholarship Fund for 50% of the minimum gift while receiving full benefits for that level. Young Alumni can join at 50% of any level up to Bengal Tiger ($1000).

game day events, and more! To join the Tiger Scholarship Fund today as a Young Alumni,
