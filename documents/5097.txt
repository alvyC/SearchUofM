                     Frequently Asked Questions
                     
                     Do temporary employees receive holiday pay? No. Temporary employees do not receive pay for holiday, bereavement, annual or sick
                        leave.
                     
                     
                     Will I need to go through the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) to hire a temporary
                           employee? No. The Workforce Management section of Human Resources does consult, however, with
                        OIE to ensure compliance with all regulations regarding the hiring of temporaries,
                        especially in the case of annual salary greater than specified limits and nepotism.
                     
                     
                     How much may I pay a temporary employee? Use the university's pay plan as a guideline. Specified rates have to be approved
                        by HR Compensation.
                     
                     
                     May a departing faculty member be paid all deferred money and longevity, if due, in
                           a lump sum payment? Yes, with the approval of the Provost.
                     
                     
                     May I use my University office address as my permanent address? No. A permanent/home address is needed for several reasons, not the least of which
                        is that in the case of emergency; the University needs to know where to reach an employee
                        and/or their family. Further, any mail addressed to a University office, i.e. department
                        office, can be considered University business and subject to being opened even if
                        it has an employee name on it.
                     
                     
                     May someone review my employee record maintained in the Human Resources Records office? Yes. The employee's supervisor may review the record at any time. In addition under
                        Tennessee Public Records laws, any citizen of the State of Tennessee may review and
                        even purchase copies of employee personnel files. Notwithstanding, however, under
                        the same laws certain personal information may not be reviewed. These are unpublished
                        telephone numbers; bank account information; social security number; driver license
                        number except where driving or operating a vehicle is part of the employee's job description
                        or job duties or incidental to the performance of the employee's job; and the same
                        information of immediate family members or household members.
                     
                     
                     Where may I obtain a copy of my W-2? Current employees may retrieve and print a copy of past W-2 forms via the myMemphis
                        Portal, Employee Tab. Previous employees without Portal access should contact the
                        Payroll Department in Room 272 of the Administration Building or by calling 678-3841
                        to obtain a printed copy.
                     
                     
                     Where do I go to change my W-4 or Direct Deposit? Forms are available online. You may also go in person to the Payroll office, located
                        in the Administration Building, room 272.
                     
                     
                     How may I find my U-Number (aka, University ID#, Banner ID#)? Your U-Number is your unique University identification number. It consists of the
                        letter "U" followed by 8 digits. You should include this number, rather than your
                        social security number, in all correspondence with the University. Do not supply your
                        social security number unless specifically asked by a University employee who has
                        a legitimate need to know it. Your U-Number is also referred to as your University
                        ID#, Banner ID#, or even Student ID#. There are two methods you may use to find this
                        information, the myMemphis portal or iAM. Directions to both are listed below.
