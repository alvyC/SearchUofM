                     Our staff photographer is available by appointment only and focuses on general campus
                        photography and high profile events. If your event will feature our President, Provost
                        or a local/national dignitary, it is suggested that you contact Rhonda Cosentino to ensure your event is on her calendar. Our photographer's ability to shoot your
                        event is also at the discretion of the V.P External Relations and Director of Marketing.
                     
                     
                     For events that will not have a high profile attendee or if you are just shooting
                        for archival purposes, our office has two digital SLR cameras that we can loan you.
                        If you need to borrow one of our loaner cameras, please visit the Department Of Marketing
                        and Communication, 303 Administration Building or contact our staff photographer for
                        details and availability. These cameras are available on a first come, first served
                        basis and must be returned to us fully charged and in proper working condition.
                     
                     
                     Our staff videographer is also available by appointment only. His focus is on high
                        level events (those featuring our President, Provost or a local/national dignitary),
                        capturing video that promotes the University and other video projects assigned by
                        our office. His services are not available for the purposes of archiving footage of
                        an event. Our videographer's ability to film an event/project is also at the discretion
                        of the V.P External Relations and Director of Marketing.
