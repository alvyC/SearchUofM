                     Q: Can I transfer credits into the MSW program?
                     
                     A: It is possible to transfer up to 24 hours of course credit into the MSW program.
                        Courses taken in another accredited or in candidacy MSW program may be transferred
                        as required foundation courses. Courses taken in a graduate program in a related field
                        to social work may transfer in as elective hours. Transfer of credit hours is subject
                        to approval by the student's advisor and the director of the MSW program. Students
                        seeking to transfer credits should work closely with their academic advisor.
                     
                     
                     Q: Can I receive credits by examination?
                     
                     A: Students may receive credit by examination for up to 9 credit hours. Students seeking
                        credit by examination should review the requirements and follow the procedures in
                        the MSW student manual and the Graduate Catalog. Credit by examination may only be
                        given in the following eight courses: SWRK 7001, SWRK 7002, SWRK 7003, SWRK 7005,

                     Q: Is the program accredited?
                     
                     A: The MSW program at University of Memphis received initial accreditation from the
                        Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) in February 2014. You may find the program
                        listed in the directory of accredited programs here.
                     
                     
                     Q: Can I use work/life experience in lieu of academic credit?
                     
                     A: No. The University of Memphis Master of Social Work program does NOT give credit
                        for prior life experience or for prior work experience. In addition, credit may not
                        be given for continuing education hours. This University of Memphis MSW program follows
                        this policy strictly to be in compliance with Council on Social Work Education (CSWE)
                        accreditation standards.
                     
                     
                     Q: What do I do if I'm applying for the MSW program and my GPA is low?
                     
                     A: There is not a minimum GPA required for the program. The admissions committee considers
                        the total application. The committee gives more weight to the last 60 of course credit
                        taken including credit hours taken in other graduate programs.
                     
                     
                     Q: Do I have to take an entrance exam to be admitted to the MSW program?

                     Q: How do I register for an entrance exam?
