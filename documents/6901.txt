                     This paper extends Sowa's (1997) Meaning Triangle to develop a framework for accounting
                     information systems (AIS) research—the Research Pyramid. This framework identifies
                     relationships between objects in economic reality, people's concepts of economic reality,
                     symbols used to record and represent economic reality, and the resultant accounting
                     information systems that capture and present data about economic reality. The Research
                     Pyramid has two major uses. First, the paper illustrates how the Research Pyramid
                     can be used to identify new research questions to extend existing research streams.
                     To be used in this manner, existing AIS research is classified along each of the edges
                     of the Research Pyramid. Once an area of the literature has been analyzed, the edges
                     that have not been studied extensively reveal potential primitive mappings for future
                     exploration. Second, each primitive mapping is evaluated to identify which of four
                     research methodologies (design science, field studies, survey research, and laboratory
                     experiments) are likely techniques for use in future studies. This analysis can help
                     researchers with strong methodological training to identify new, interesting questions
                     to be answered that capitalize on their research strengths. As such, the Research
                     Pyramid is a tool to characterize existing AIS research, identify areas for future
                     exploration, and provide guidance on appropriate methodologies to apply.
