                      Transitional Academic Studies (TRAC) at the University of Memphis permits students
                        to enroll in prescribed courses to develop the academic competencies necessary for
                        success in college level courses. Major components of the program include testing
                        and placement in appropriate level courses.
                     
                     
                     Placement Students admitted to the University of Memphis as beginning freshmen will be placed
                        in appropriate English, math, and reading, courses based on ACT subscores that are
                        less than 3 years old.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Students with ACT reading subscores below 19 are required to enroll in ACAD 1100.
                        
                        Students with ACT English subscores below 18 are required to enroll in prescribed
                           English courses.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     If students feel they have been misplaced by their ACT subscores in English and reading,
                        they may take the COMPASS test to attempt to place in a higher level course.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        All students, regardless of their ACT math subscore, are required to take the ALEKS placement exam for math.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Students without ACT scores will be required to take the COMPASS placement test to
                        determine if they have the appropriate academic skills to successfully complete college
                        level courses. Depending on the results of this test, students may be required to
                        take one or more prescribed courses. The following regulations regarding placement
                        tests and course enrollment will apply:
                     
                     
                     COMPASS testing is required of students whose ACT (SAT) scores are more than 3 years
                        old, transfer students with no college level credit in English, non-degree seeking
                        students before enrollment in English, and students with no ACT/SAT scores.
                     
                     
                     ALEKS testing is required of transfer students with no college level credit in math,
                        and non-degree seeking students before enrollment in a math course.
                     
                     
                     Students must successfully complete prescribed course requirements before enrolling
                        in the next level course.
                     
                     
                     Enrollment in any prescribed course is restricted to students who have been placed
                        by their ACT subscores or who have taken the appropriate placement test. Self-placement
                        without testing is not permitted.
                     
                     
                     ALEKS - Math Placement Exam The University of Memphis requires the Math Placement Exam through ALEKS to assess
                        a student's prerequisite knowledge for course placement. ALEKS is a powerful artificial-intelligence
                        based assessment tool that zeros in on the strengths and weaknesses of a student's
                        mathematical knowledge, reports its findings to the student, and then if necessary
                        provides the student with a learning environment for bringing this knowledge up to
                        an appropriate level for course placement.
                     
                     
                     Please visit the ALEKS website for more information.
