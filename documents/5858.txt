                                 Manufacturing pottery is a tradition that has been passed down through generations
                                    of the Acoma people. The pots are known for their very thin walls, beautiful geometric
                                    designs and black-white-red slip paintings. This jar features a traditional design
                                    and shape though its small size indicates that it may have been made for sale to tourists.

                                 On any given day, about 70,000 young people are in juvenile detention or correctional
                                    facilities. This multidisciplinary exhibition and project by photographer Richard
                                    Ross documents the placement and treatment of American juveniles housed by law in
                                    facilities that treat, confine, punish, assist, and occasionally, harm them. Ross
                                    has photographed and interviewed more than 1,000 juveniles at more than 200 facilities
                                    in 31 states. The work exists at the juncture of art, social practice and politics.

                                 Perceptions of Me is an exhibition that gives voice to teenagers who are talked and
                                    written about, but rarely listened to, raising our awareness of how Memphis teens
                                    perceive themselves. This is a collaborative project organized by Penny Dodds working
                                    with several innovative Memphis organizations that provide positive social and creative
                                    environments for youth in our community: BRIDGES, storybooth at Crosstown Arts and
                                    Caritas Village.

                                 The Civil Rights Movement generated an abundance of photographs documenting the African
                                    American fight for equality and economic, political and social justice. The images
                                    captured by local and national news outlets recorded this struggle and some have become
                                    iconic images representing a collective memory of the era. Curated by Leila I. Hamdan
                                    from the UM Libraries Special Collections, these photographs illustrate a new view
                                    of the struggle in Memphis.

                                       Print media is disappearing and being replaced by ever mutating digital media. For
                                       more than 200 years news media have documented our histories. How will we capture
                                       our memories in 2050?

                                 Conceived as a multidisciplinary project encompassing architecture, design, and photography,
                                    Bauhaus twenty-21 not only conveys the architectural history, but also illustrates
                                    the enduring philosophies of the Bauhaus. The exhibition, by creating a visual as
                                    well as theoretical dialogue between the timeless modernism of Bauhaus architecture
                                    and the visions of contemporary practitioners, offers a unique perspective on Bauhaus

                                 After traveling the world seeking inspiration, Carroll Cloar realized that he wanted
                                    to return and draw inspiration from the place he lovedâthe South. It was home.
                                 
                                 
                                 AMUM's exhibition "In His Studio: Carroll Cloar" features some of the artist's earliest
                                    work, his reconstructed studio, drawings, sketches and photographs. Cloar's writings
                                    inform the exhibition labels and provide a glimpse into his working methods and recollections.

                                 Time Pools: Accessing the Aquifer is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between Jason
                                    Miller's Digital Art class and The League of Imaginary Scientists, a group of science-minded
                                    artists. Additional project contributors include Michelle Dry and Dr. Scott Schoefernacker
                                    from the University of Memphis Ground Water Institute and software developer Silvester
                                    Kozajda. The purpose of the project, like many of the League's endeavors, is to explore
                                    scientific material through art and infuse both with a sense of play.

                                 Hot Cold Cool presents late 20th century art from four fine art print portfolios in
                                    AMUM's collection. "Ten Works by Ten Artists" published in 1964 includes silkscreens
                                    by iconic American Minimalist and Pop artists. By contrast, the portfolio "American
                                    Artists and Writers Protest the War in Vietnam" of 1967 expresses furious political
                                    antagonism. "Ten Lithographs by Ten Artists" produced in 1971 represents a return
                                    to figurative and expressive imagery in America. The 1973 World Print portfolio demonstrates
                                    the liveliness of the artistic interchange among nations during the Cold War era.

                                 The genre of satirical posters, an important tool of the Soviet government, ridiculed
                                    corruption, waste, inefficiency, and abuse attempting to shame individuals into improvement.

                                    heel of the former Soviet Union, was the topic for many of the posters in this portfolio.

                                 A survey of the past two decades of work by New York abstract painter Alison Weld.
                                    Weld typically pairs her aggressive approach to abstraction with swatches of commercially
                                    printed patterns to comment on a host of issues and personal concerns.
