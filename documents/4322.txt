                     Rita Lucarelli, PhD , is assistant professor of Egyptology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her
                        areas of specialization include religion, magic and science in ancient Egypt and Antiquity,
                        ancient Egyptian funerary literature, and demonology in ancient Egypt and Antiquity.
                     
                     
                     This lecture will discuss the character of ancient Egyptian magical practices, with
                        a special focus on the role that demons played in magical texts and images. Dr. Lucarelli
                        will share with us her most up-to-date understanding of what is meant by "magic" and
                        "demons" in ancient Egypt and in the ancient world at large. Information from textual
                        and material sources (magical spells, ritual and magical objects) produced from the
                        early Pharaonic to the Greco-Roman periods in Egypt will be presented and comparative
                        views with other demonologies of the ancient world will also be explored.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Lucarelli studied at the University of Naples "L'Orientale," Italy, and received
                        her MA degree in Classical Languages and Egyptology. She holds her Ph.D. from Leiden
                        University in the Netherlands. She is currently completing a monograph on demonology
                        in ancient Egypt and she is one of the coordinators of the Ancient Egyptian Demonology
                        Project: http://www.demonthings.com . In 2006, her doctoral dissertation was published as  The Book of the Dead of Gatseshen: Ancient Egyptian Funerary Religion in the 10th

                     Renée Friedman, PhD ,  is the director of the Hierakonpolis Expedition in Egypt and Heagy Research Curator

                     The ancient Egyptian city of Nekhen (known as Hierakonpolis to the Greek and Roman
                        world) was one of the largest urban centers along the Nile River during the fourth
                        millennium. Its great temple of the falcon god Horus produced some of the most important
                        early artifacts, including the Narmer Palette, which appears to document the unification
                        of Upper and Lower Egypt over 5,000 years ago. The site continues to yield important
                        information about early Egyptian history. Dr. Friedman will present some of her most
                        important recent research on the site.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Friedman earned her doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley and is
                        a world renowned scholar specializing in the earliest stages of ancient Egyptian prehistory
                        and history. She has extensive field experience in Egypt, including leading excavations
                        at the site of ancient Nekhen. She became the director of the Hierakonpolis Expedition
                        in 1996.
