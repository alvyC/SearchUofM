                     Learning lists of facts, for example multiplication tables or the bones in the body,
                        is important in many contexts, including school and work. Here at the University of
                        Memphis Institute of Intelligent Systems, researchers are pioneering computer software
                        (FaCT) that makes this task substantially easier and faster. This revolutionary software
                        does this by using an intricate model of the learners progress to compute when each
                        flashcard should be repeated for the learner so as to achieve optimal long term performance.
                        Multiple applications, including math, foreign languages, face-name learning and geography,
                        are being investigated since the software works interchangeably with flashcards composed
                        of text, sound files, or images. Published research shows powerful effects compared
                        to alternative methods of learning.
