                     2nd Annual Film Innovation Challenge
                     
                     For as long as there has been film there have been filmmakers who imagined what the
                        future would hold. The history of filmography is one which has seen the bridge between
                        science fiction and the technically possible grow shorter and shorter with each passing
                        year. This year the FedEx Institute of Technology is pleased to announce that the
                        contest formerly known as the GoPro FilmFest will be expanded to include films which
                        address both technology innovation through their techniques and their subject matter.
                        Films will be judged by an expert panel and will be awarded.

                        with IndieMemphis, an opportunity for students and filmmakers from across the city
                        to enter their best GoPro-made films. We were pleased to award University of Memphis
                        student Kevin Brooks with the grand prize. We are excited that for the second year,
                        the FedEx Institute will host a film competition designed to encourage filmmakers
                        to embrace emerging technologies in their film making.
