                        laughed, sang, and were inspired. On top of all the enlightenment, with snacks provided,
                        breakout sessions provided an opportunity for networking and engaging in more in-depth
                        discussions with the speakers and other participants.
                     
                     
                     The goal of the Lightning Talks event was to create a buzz about BIT and build a stronger
                        community of like-minded students, alumni, advisory board members, and region industry
                        folks. The rapid-fire format was chosen to offer a series of thought-provoking topics
                        in a quick, insightful manner in order to convey important ideas and allow for multiple
                        presenters to share their thoughts in a short time period. If you couldn't make it
                        to this year's event, don't worry, see videos of the talks below:
