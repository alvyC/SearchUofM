                     Fair Labor Standards Act FAQs
                     
                     On May 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) published revised regulations
                        regarding the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). These regulations will impact how employers
                        classify and pay their employees. Effective December 1, 2016, the new minimum salary
                        threshold to qualify as exempt will increase to $913/week or $47,476/year. These regulations
                        will impact many positions here at the UofM. This page is being created to help answer
                        questions related to these changes.

                     Why is the university changing my position? The federal government revised their regulations regarding employees and overtime
                        accruals. Based on your position and/or salary, it has been determined that you will
                        now be in a classification that will be overtime eligible.
                     
                     
                     I'm currently exempt (paid monthly). Although my duties haven't changed, my salary
                           is below $47,476/year. What happens to me? There will be no changes to your salary. Your pay cycle will convert from monthly
                        pay to biweekly pay. You will have to complete a electronic timesheet instead of a
                        leave report. You are now considered non-exempt.
                     
                     
                     When is this supposed to be effective? The date established by the Department of Labor (DOL) is no later than December 1,
                        2016. Affected employees will continue to be paid monthly through the end of the 2016
                        calendar year, though during the month of December, both an electronic leave report
                        and a paper timesheet will need to be completed and submitted to Workforce Management. The conversion to
                        biweekly timesheets only will be effective January 1, 2017.
                     
                     
                     Non-exempt (biweekly paid) employees currently begin earning one day of annual leave
                           per month. I have been earning two days per month as an exempt employee. Will this
                           change when I become non-exempt? No. In an effort to lessen the impact of these changes on our workforce, the University
                        worked to save this important benefit for affected employees. A significant number
                        of colleges and universities did not permit affected employees to have their leave
                        accruals remain in tact. At the UofM, it has been decided that all exempt employees
                        hired on or before September 1st being converted to non-exempt will be grandfathered
                        with their current leave accruals. New non-exempt employees, however, will begin earning
                        one day of annual leave per month.
                     
                     
                     Does the changes to DOL affect my existing benefits like medical, dental, retirement,
                           etc.? No. None of your other benefits will be impacted. You will remain in the same retirement
                        program you are in now. In addition, all of your other benefits will remain the same
                        (unless there is a unrelated change at the state level that impacts everyone).
                     
                     
                     What is the new DOL salary requirement that caused these changes? According to the DOL regulations, "An employee must receive compensation on a salary
                        basis of not less than $913 per week (the equivalent of $47,476 a year)" in order
                        to be considered exempt (not eligible for overtime).
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Are there any exceptions to the new DOL exempt requirements? Yes. The DOL has outlined a special provision for "Academic Administrative" employees.
                        "Academic Administrative" employees include certain positions whose primary duty is
                        to perform administrative functions directly related to academic instruction or training. For this reason, HR is individually
                        analyzing each position affected to determine if they qualify under this exemption.
                        HR will utilize the survey and/or position description of each employee to make the
                        assessment.
                     
                     
                     Will full-time faculty be affected by the DOL changes? No. The regulation specifically exempted faculty, stating that "Employees in higher
                        education institutions who are teachers will not be affected by the Final Rule."
                     
                     
                     I have post-doctoral fellows in my department. Will they be affected? As outlined by DOL, post-docs must satisfy the salary level of $47,476 per year in
                        order to qualify as exempt employees.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     As a Business Officer, I am responsible for managing the budget of my department or
                           area. Will there be any changes with the coding and tracking of these employees? Yes. All employees changing from exempt to non-exempt will have to be given a new
                        position number and new E-Class. In addition, they will also have to track their hours
                        via an electronic timesheet (instead of a leave report). It will be important that
                        we communicate to everyone affected that timesheets are turned in by the deadline
                        date. HR will continue to provide more guidance on this matter as we approach the
                        deadline. Training is being developed for both employees and supervisors who need
                        to learn how to track, record, and approve time for non-exempt employees.
                     
                     
                     My manager has talked with us about some of these changes. One of the options she
                           is considering is changing our schedule. Can she do that? Yes. A manager/supervisor is responsible for effectively managing their work unit.
                        Therefore, they have the discretion to reorganize workloads, adjust schedules, and/or
                        spread work hours in a manner that is consistent with business need. If you have a
                        specific question or concern, please feel free to contact HR Workforce Management
                        at 901.678.3573.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     As a department manager, I cannot afford to pay overtime rates. Can I offer compensatory
                           time ("comp time") to my employees instead? The university is currently reviewing the possibility of creating a comp time policy.
                        If approved, system changes are required and may not be completed prior to DOL implementation.
                        We will continue to provide information as it becomes available.
                     
                     
                     I am currently exempt but my position is changing to non-exempt. I travel for the
                           university. Do I get paid overtime? How do I track my hours? Information regarding how to handle travel for non-exempt employees was discussed
                        at the May 2016 HR Partners meeting. Please refer to the PowerPoint presentation from that meeting for more information and examples. If after reviewing you still
                        have questions, please feel free to contact Workforce Management at 901.678.3573.
                     
                     
                     What will the university do about compression issues related to the Department of
                           Labor changes? The University will continue to review compression issues throughout the organization
                        and make recommendations as funds permit.
                     
                     
                     How can I get more information? The Department of Human Resources will be hosting various informational sessions prior
                        to the December 1st implementation date. Additionally we have been meeting with each
                        Division to discuss specific changes. Each employee impacted will receive a personal
                        notification this fall. More information will be provided on this site in the coming
                        weeks. Please check back periodically for updates.
