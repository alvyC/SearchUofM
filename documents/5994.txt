                        Knowledge ( MD2K ) initiative. The project's first year has focused on developing an open-source smartphone
                        software platform to allow users to "collect, analyze, visualize, and interpret mobile
                        sensor data for health."
                     
                     
                      MedicalXpress 's article focuses on the work of Dr. Sidney D'Mello, a U of M Ph.D. graduate who
                        is now an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Computer Science and Engineering at
                        Notre Dame. He and his team are developing software that determines when a person
                        loses focus on a task and helps them regain that focus; they are hoping to apply it
                        towards STEM education.
