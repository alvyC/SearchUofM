                        for the next semester. You are not able to register for classes until you've been
                        cleared by your advisor.
                     
                     
                     If you're not sure who your advisor is, contact the Department's advising coordinator
                        (currently Mr. Kriangsiri Malasri ).

                        Computer science major and minor requirements are available in the University Catalog . We also offer a "second major," which falls between a minor and a traditional double
                           major.
                        
                        
                        A degree checklist and prerequisite flowchart are available at the bottom of our Degree Programs page.
                        
                        
                        The UMdegree system (accessible through the My Degree tab at my.memphis.edu , or directly at umdegree.memphis.edu ) is an invaluable resource. It tracks which degree requirements you've already met
                           and shows you the available options for outstanding requirements.

                        You should take the online ALEKS math placement exam to determine which math course you should start with at the U of M. The Interpret Your Results section on the ALEKS website contains the score ranges needed for each math course.
                           Note that the first major course (COMP 1900) has a corequisite of Calculus I (MATH
                           1910). Depending on your math background and ALEKS score, you may need to take a few
                           semesters of algebra and/or trigonometry (MATH 1100, 1710, 1720) before being able
                           to start the major courses.
                        
                        
                        In order to be a full-time student (12 or more semester hours), you must submit proof
                           of MMR and varicella vaccinations to the Student Health Center. Please see here for more information and to upload this documentation online.
                        
                        
                        New freshmen should register for a New Student Orientation session.
                        
                        
                        For transfer students, the University's Admissions office is responsible for making most transfer credit decisions. You can refer to
                           their Transfer Equivalency Tables to get an idea of which of your courses will likely transfer. You will need to request
                           official transcripts from your prior school(s) before your transfer credit can be
                           processed.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Declaring a CS Major or Minor
                     
                     If you are a student from another major who wants to change majors to Computer Science, contact the College of Arts and Sciences office on the first
                        floor of Scates Hall to officially declare the major.  The CAS office can also be
                        reached at casgraduation@memphis.edu .
                     
                     
                     To add a Computer Science second major or minor :
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        If your first major is in the College of Arts and Sciences, contact the Arts and Sciences
                           office in Scates Hall.
                        
                        
                        If your first major is in another college (Engineering, Business, Communication/Fine
                           Arts, etc.), contact the advising office of your college.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Contact the Department's advising coordinator after you've added the major/minor to discuss your class selection.
