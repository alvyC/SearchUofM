		ECourseware Update

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		A TBR-wide upgrade of eCourseware (Desire 2 Learn) will occur during the holiday break.  Please be aware of the important dates, times, and services below:

12/27/13 – The eCourseware system will go offline at 12:01a.m.  You will not be able to log in to the system (and if you are logged in at that time, your session will be terminated), and you will receive a maintenance message explaining that the system is being upgraded.
1/2/14 – The eCourseware system will be back online at 8:00 a.m, with the upgrades in place and tested.  At that point, you will be able to get into the system to conduct all your normal activities.
Also on 1/2/14, the normal process for course combines will resume.  Course combines will be processed within three (3) business days of the time they are submitted.
The Training Schedule  for the new version of eCourseware will be available in multiple formats, beginning on 1/2/14 through Learning Curve  (faculty only).
Individual consultations can be scheduled at Consultation Ticket
If you have questions:

Email umtech@memphis.edu
Call the Help Desk at 901-678-8888.  Help Desk staff are being given additional training in eCourseware and will be able to answer many of your questions



No new features will be available on 1/2/14.  We are making the upgraded baseline system available first, to be sure that it is stable and able to handle the start-of-semester load, before we activate any of the new features available.
Thank you,
Ellen

		TechQual+ Campus-Wide Survey

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		Colleagues,
Around this time each year, the University has historically participated in the Techqual+ survey to obtain feedback regarding information technology service quality.  To align our collection of this data more closely with the academic calendar, we will be conducting the survey for 2014 toward the end of the spring semester.  Reminders and notifications will be posted to the portal and this blog when the survey is opened in the spring.
Regards,
Ellen
