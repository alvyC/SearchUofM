                     Artist Lecture: September 15, 7 pm (ACB 310) Opening Reception: September 16, 5-7:30 pm
                     
                     
                     Sue Johnson: Home of Future Things is an exhibition featuring works by the artist Sue Johnson that considers the cyclical
                        nature of mass consumption. The exhibition features small-scale works on paper as
                        well as floor-to-ceiling vinyl panels and decals that the artist has designedâ€”transforming
                        the gallery into the interior of an ideal, modern home. As the exhibition title suggests,
                        Johnson envisions a world in which the home is nostalgic and familiar yet also reduced
                        to an empty space existing simply to house various things.
                     
                     
                     Johnson's work makes various art historical allusions ranging from ancient Greek mosaics
                        and 17th-century Dutch still-life paintings to Dada and Pop collages. Despite spanning
                        a vast expanse of time and place, these references share a common fascination with
                        commodities and excess that Johnson remixes through a 21st-century lens. Specifically,
                        her work is rooted in the Dutch still-life tradition of vanitas â€”images that contemplate the transience of life through the display of objects with
                        symbolic meaning. Her process intentionally blurs the boundaries between the real
                        and imagined,historical and timeless, hand-painted and digital. What results is an
                        immersive environment constantly tugging at our sense of reality.

                     Laura J. Lawson | MFA Thesis Exhibition
                     
                     October 21 â€“ November 4 Opening Reception: October 21, 5-7:30 pm
                     
                     
                     DÃ©paysement is the MFA thesis exhibition featuring the work of Laura J. Lawson. DÃ©paysement , a French word with no direct English translation, describes the feeling of being
                        out of one's home country. The exhibition addresses her three years in Memphis contrasted
                        with her recent artist residency in Marnay-sur-Seine, France.
                     
                     
                     Lawson's paintings are made with ink on translucent plastic. The result resembles
                        cartographic endeavors, separating the viewer from each place with an aerial perspective.
                        Her two largest works layer these paintings in front of cut paper maps in a grid formation,
                        creating shadows of highways beneath the landscape-like surface. In other works, Lawson
                        has drawn directly on the painting to mix the universal qualities of topography with
                        the arbitrary shapes of borders and roads. The color palettes of all of these paintings
                        are specifically derived from either Memphis or Marnay-sur-Seine, but the characteristics
                        of these places become lost in the similar and strange elements of geography.
