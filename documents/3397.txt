                     What is expected of UofM students?
                     
                     You and your classmates are expected to conduct yourselves with character and integrity
                        in academics and in everyday life. Our distinguished scholastic pursuits mean everything
                        to the University of Memphis, and we do not take the issue of integrity lightly. You
                        are expected to uphold our high academic standards and complete your assignments,
                        exams and other scholastic efforts with 100% honesty. You must cite sources and acknowledge
                        the contributions of others when used in your scholastic work. Academic dishonesty
                        will not be tolerated on any level. By rising to these standards each and every day,
                        you are helping to build our reputation as a world-class major research university
                        advancing knowledge, innovation, creativity, discovery and artistic expression in
                        the Mid-South and beyond.
