                        Total credit-by-examination applied to a student's degree program may not exceed nine (9)
                           semester hours.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     The student must follow these steps to obtain credit by examination:
                     
                     
                        
                        Fill out the top of the form and obtain the signatures of the major advisor, department chair,
                           and college director of graduate studies.
                        
                        
                        Pay the fee and attach the receipt to the form.
                        
                        Take the form to the department chair, who will sign it after the exam has been taken
                           and a satisfactory grade earned.
                        
                        
                        When the department chair returns the completed form to the Graduate School, the Vice Provost
                           for Graduate Studies or designee will authorize the posting of the credit to the student's
                           record.
                        
                        
                        The form of the examination, the method of administering it, and the time of examination are
                           left to the discretion of colleges and academic units.
                        
                        
                        To receive credit, the student's examination grade should be equivalent to at least
                           a "B" (3.0). Credit is indicated on the student's record as "S" but is not figured
                           in the GPA.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     The only remedy to an unsuccessful credit-by-examination grade is to enroll in and
                        complete the course.
                     
                     
                     Maximum Combined Credit Hours to Fulfill Degree Requirements
                     
                     For Master's students, the maximum amount of combined hours of transfer credit, credit
                        by examination, course validation and experiential learning credit that can be used
                        to fulfill degree requirements is two-thirds the number of hours required for the
                        degree.
                     
                     
                     For doctoral students, the maximum amount of combined hours of transfer credit, credit-by-examination,
                        course validation and experiential learning credit that can be used to fulfill degree
                        requirements two-thirds the number of hours required for the degree.
                     
                     
                     The Graduate School sets minimum standards to which all the diverse graduate programs
                        across the university must adhere. Individual colleges, schools, and graduate programs
                        are encouraged to set more stringent requirements as necessary to meet their accreditation
                        and student needs.
