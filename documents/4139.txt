                        you. Sessions last one hour.

                     About Personal Training
                     
                     Personal training is the science of teaching a client how to use his/her body correctly
                        and efficiently in every action he or she might execute. This includes, but is not
                        limited to, weight training and cardiovascular exercise. Personal training is frequently
                        used for advances in sports specific training, rehabilitation (pre- and post-surgery),
                        weight loss, and general fitness. The best personal training is accomplished in individual
                        sessions to ensure that the trainer's focus is centered on one client at a time.
                     
                     
                     24-Hour Cancellation Policy
                     
                     You must provide your personal trainer with 24-hour notice if you are unable to keep
                        your appointment, except in cases of emergency or sudden illness. In the latter cases,
                        please inform your personal trainer as soon as possible. Otherwise a missed session
                        will count as a completed session having already been purchased.
                     
                     
                     Late Arrivals
                     
                     
                     If you arrive late for your appointment, your session will still end one hour after
                        the original scheduled meeting time. Pay for session(s) at entry counter. Present your receipt to trainer at time of appointment.
