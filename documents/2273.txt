                        offer two ways to tour the Herff College of Engineering.
                     
                     
                     engineering luncheon (option 1)
                     
                     Our most popular tour throughout the fall semester and a few times during the spring
                        semester is our Engineering Luncheon. These luncheons consist of a light lunch, an
                        info session, details on Herff's world-renowned engineering programs, and a tour of
                        labs from each engineering department. We hold these luncheons on the 3rd Thursday
                        and last Monday of every month. We begin promptly at 11:30am and end around 2:00pm. Click here to schedule an Engineering Luncheon Tour. Â  We look forward to seeing you soon!
                     
                     General Engineering Tour (option 2)
                     
                     Our second option is our General Engineering Tour, which can be scheduled most weeks
                        Monday - Friday 9am-4pm. These tours consist of a brief info session, details on Herff's
                        world renowned engineering programs, and a lab tour (if time and personnel permit). To maximize your visit to the Herff College of Engineering, we suggest you consider
                        attending the UofM Campus Main Memphis Campus Tours so you can get all of your questions answered.
