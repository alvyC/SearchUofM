                     Security at FedExForum
                     
                     Walk-through magnetometers were installed at FedExForum under the premise of being
                        used at all Memphis Grizzlies games, as per an NBA mandate conceptualized this summer
                        during league security meetings. The magnetometers have become an industry standard
                        across MLB, NHL and NFL venues and their use will now be mandatory for every FedExForum
                        event in order to improve fan safety and guest experience, a shared goal between FedExForum,
                        the University of Memphis and touring production companies.
                     
                     
                     To ensure your Commencement ceremony is enjoyable for you and your guests, please
                           note the following:
                     
                     • Guests are advised to bring ONLY necessary items to the FedExForum during events,
                        concerts and games.
                     
                     
                     • Separate express lanes will be available for guests in the Grand Lobby without bags
                        to be inspected.
                     
                     
                     • Guests will not need to remove their hats, shoes, belts, watches or jewelry as with
                        airport security. Instead, guests will have to place their cell phones, cameras and
                        keys on a security table prior to walking through the metal detector.
                     
                     
                     • Expectant mothers, those with pacemakers and ADA guests are not subject to the magnetometers
                        and will instead be screened through handheld devices."
