                           Dr. Yeasin is an Associate Professor and a Data Scientist. He is the recipient of
                              National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Grant, Senior Member of the IEEE and Associate
                              Editor of two peer reviewed Journals (BMC Bioinformatics and PRML). He is practicing
                              machine learning for 15 years in the field of Bioinformatics, Biomedical Engineering,
                              Computer Vision, Cognitive Engineering, Human Computer Interaction and Assistive Technology.
                              He is leading a group of enthusiastic students to conduct cutting edge research in
                              collaboration with partners from the academia, industry, and community at large. He
                              is the leader of Blind Ambition – an interdisciplinary research and outreach effort
                              pioneering assistive solutions for people who are blind. He introduced the notion
                              of assistive thinking – a seamless blend of participatory design, system thinking
                              and design thinking to develop technology solutions.
                           
                           
                           He has 23 years of academic experience and authored/co-authored over 125 peer reviewed
                              technical papers. He is committed to provide quality educational experiences while
                              gaining perspective through research, and engaged scholarship. He has proven record
                              of academic excellence and established a successful research program to: (i) publish
                              original works in peer reviewed journals and conferences, (ii) recruit, train and
                              retain graduate students and also minority students, (iii) identify and advance cutting
                              edge research, (iv) integrate research with the classroom teaching to increase his
                              effectiveness as an educator, and (v) create a culture of research. He has been involved
                              with many technological innovations (for example, ARIANA, Emo-Assist, Expression,
                              i-FEPS, O-MAP, i-TOBI/i-CBE etc.). He pioneered the concept of co-analysis of signals
                              and sense for modeling emotions, behavioral expressions, epistemic statIMG_3498e of
                              mind, gestures and consumer demographics. He strives to find intuitive explanation
                              of complex concepts to further innovation. He is an expert and also an enthusiast
                              of asking relevant questions, connecting ideas and is a life long learner. He has
                              extensive knowledge in video analysis and big data analytics.
                           
                           
                           Assistive Technology Solutions: The main goal is to develop adaptive, affordable, effective, portable and usable
                              assistive technology solutions for the people who are blind or visual impaired. The
                              key idea is to keep the design simple so that the user can interact with the system
                              effectively with minimal cognitive effort.
