                     Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law
                     
                     In January 2010, the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law moved to its 125 year old facility
                        that has served as a U.S. Custom House, Court House, and Post Office over a 125 year
                        span. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
                     
                     
                     Constructed in the 1880s, the original building reflected the Italianate Revival style,
                        had four floors, and was considered one of the most beautiful buildings in the South.
                        The building grew along with downtown Memphis. During several projects, limestone
                        was added to the exterior of the building, and marble was added to the interior. While
                        the Custom House and Federal Court relocated, the Post Office maintained some offices
                        in the building until the law school renovation began in early 2008.
                     
                     
                     Architects discovered and restored beautiful woodwork and intricate, hand-painted
                        stencil designs. Wainscot paneling was repaired and relocated to various parts of
                        the building. Original plaster decorations were restored, such as those on the ceiling
                        in the historic courtroom.
                     
                     
                     The 169,000-square-foot building now functions as a state-of-the-art, 21st-century
                        learning environment, complete with wireless Internet access, an open and accessible
                        law library, and all the comforts of a modern, high-tech facility. Despite the renovations,
                        the building retains much of its historic look.

                        $42 million renovation to transform building to state-of-the-art legal education facility.
                        
                        Original Tennessee marble, still in place today, inspired the color scheme throughout
                           the historic building.

                        "Smart Classrooms" include the ability to podcast, individual electrical outlets for
                           each student for laptop use, and stadium seating.
                        
                        
                        The architect, Bill Nixon, calls the Gordon Ball Scenic Reading Room the "jewel box"
                           of the building because it features windows that stretch for 200 feet and offers an
                           unmatched view of the Mississippi River.
