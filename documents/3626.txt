                     Students enrolled in the University of Memphis Neighborhood Preservation Clinic have
                        the opportunity to experience lawyering from the standpoint of the municipal lawyer
                        and municipal administration addressing the complex legal, economic and social issues
                        surrounding real property abandonment and neglect in Memphis.
                     
                     
                     Working under faculty supervision, students will be assigned to investigate property
                        ownership and conditions, communicate with field code enforcement professionals, prepare
                        civil lawsuits, and prosecute neglectful owners seeking an enforceable order of compliance
                        with property maintenance and other local housing and building code standards. Cases
                        will be brought in the Shelby County Environmental Court, a unique court of special
                        jurisdiction concurrent with the Tennessee Circuit and Chancery Courts for certain
                        purposes, including the prosecution of cases alleging the existence of a public nuisance
                        (as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated §13-6-102 (8)), and requesting either an order
                        of compliance or the appointment of a receiver to abate such public nuisance.
                     
                     
                     To complement their work as anti-blight litigators, Clinic students will participate
                        in a weekly classroom session focused on the pervasive challenge of blight and abandonment
                        in Memphis. The seminar segment of the weekly class will be designed to survey substantive
                        code enforcement and housing law, explore national models of legal strategies to address
                        blight and abandonment, outline practice and procedure in the Shelby County Environmental
                        Court, provide skills training, and consider issues of ethics and professionalism
                        that arise in the context of their cases. The seminar component of the weekly class
                        will complement the case rounds component, during which students will engage in an
                        ongoing discussion of the myriad issues and challenges they are experiencing in the
                        cases they are handling.
