                        Dr. Hongmei Zhang received her PhD in Statistics in 2003 from the Iowa State University.
                           She was an Associate Professor in Biostatistics at the University of South Carolina
                           before moving to the University of Memphis. She is the recipient of several NIH research
                           grants for her collaborative work in cancer and allergic disease studies, and for
                           her statistical methodology development in variable selection, joint clustering, and
                           Bayesian network.
