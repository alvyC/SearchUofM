                        competition at SemEval-2015 , the premier forum for semantic evaluation.
                     
                     
                     The team, named NeRoSim, consisted of Ph.D. students Rajendra Banjade, Dipesh Gautam,
                        Nabin Maharjan, and Nobal Niraula, along with postdoctoral fellows Dr. Mihai Lintean
                        and Dr. Dan Stefanescu.  They participated in two tasks: the English semantic textual
                        similarity (STS) task and the interpretable STS task, achieving winning results in
                        both.  For the English STS task, the NeRoSim team ranked 10th out of 74 system runs
                        but there was no significant difference among the top 10 system runs, as stated by
                        the organizers' report.  For the interpretable STS, the team ranked 1st for the 'Headlines'
                        data subset and 2nd for the 'Images' data subset, which was the best performance overall
                        (for both datasets) of any team.
