                        program is on developing partnerships between researchers, policymakers, program developers,
                        agency personnel, and other community groups. Through these partnerships, faculty
                        conduct basic and applied research, program development, and evaluation in the many
                        different facets of crime, criminology, and justice.
                     
                     
                     The graduate program provides students with a solid foundation of knowledge about
                        criminology, victimology, and the criminal justice system. The required course work
                        emphasizes the study of research methods and statistics, providing students with the
                        skills necessary for conducting and evaluating research. Graduate students have the
                        opportunity to learn in both classroom and community settings and to work closely
                        with faculty in all facets of research.
                     
                     
                     Program objectives are: (1) fundamental understanding of criminological principles,
                        theories, and concepts; (2) development of independent research skills, including
                        data analysis and oral and written communication of research; and (3) competitive
                        for professional positions in the criminal justice field.  Students must comply with the general requirements of the Graduate School (see Admissions Regulations , Academic Regulations , and Minimum Degree Requirements ) as well as the program requirements of the degree being pursued.
