                     Story and book by Keythe Farley and Brian Flemming, Music and lyrics by Laurence O'Keefe April 14-16 and 21-23, 2011 at 8 p.m.

                     Based on a story in The Weekly World News, Bat Boy: The Musical is a show about a
                        half-boy/half-bat creature who is discovered in a cave near Hope Falls, West Virginia.
                        When he naively tries to fit in with the narrow-minded people of Hope Falls, they
                        turn on him. Soon the entire town will hear the shocking story of Bat Boy's unholy
                        origin. At a time when we strongly lump our demons into stereotypes based on nationality,
                        creed or sexual orientation and de-humanize them to gain safety in numbers, shows
                        like Bat Boy jar us awake with laughter and the moral obligation we have to all of
                        our brothers and sisters.
