                     The administrative offices of the Ecological Research Center are housed in facilities
                        located on The University of Memphis' South Campus. These facilities also contain
                        classrooms, research labs, analytical labs, and offices for faculty and students.
                        Extensive field equipment is also available for land and water research.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis Museum of Zoology collections are maintained by the ERC
                        as well as a large mammal collection containing specimens from the United States and
                        Mexico. A fish collection contains representative of fishes of the Mid-South. A newly
                        constructed aquaculture research building provides 4,000 ft2 of wet lab space for
