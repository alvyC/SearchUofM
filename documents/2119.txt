                        withdrawal, after the conclusion of the 100% fee adjustment/refund period. Students
                        will be assessed a pro-rated fee for the dropped hours. TBR policy is available online (see section XIV. Refunds).
                     
                     
                     Students are encouraged to better plan their schedules and retain their full-time
                        status on their way to a timely and successful graduation. The fee adjustment policy
                        provides for three fee adjustment periods and is based entirely upon the official
                        date of withdrawal or change of course which would result in a recalculation of fees.
                        Students who need to drop any courses or withdraw from the University should do so
                        before the start of classes for the term to ensure that no registration fees are owed.
                        Please see the Bursar's Office Calendar for specific refund/adjustment periods for each part-of-term.
                     
                     
                     Note: Summer tuition, program services and out-of-state tuition are assessed at the
                        per-hour rate, with no maximum, and do not have a reduced rate.
                     
                     
                     Fee Adjustment Calculations
                     
                     The fee adjustment calculations are based on the courses dropped; therefore, not all
                        schedule adjustments will result in a reduced fee assessment after the fee adjustment
                        calculation. Fee adjustment estimator calculations are approximate. Actual adjustment
                        amounts may vary based on individual student enrollment. To calculate fee adjustments
                        under this policy, the following formula will be used:
                     
                     
                     [((# Hours Dropped * Multiplier) + # Hours Remaining) * (Per Hour Rate)] – (prior
                        fee assessment) = Potential Fee Adjustment/Refund
                     
                     
                     Fee Adjustment Period 100%: Multiplier of 0.00 75%: Multiplier of 0.25 25%: Multiplier of 0.75 After the 25% refund period has concluded: Multiplier of 1.00
                     
                     
                     Formula Breakdown:
                     
                     Billing Hours = ((# Hours Dropped * Multiplier) + # Hours Remaining)
                     
                     (Billing Hours * Per Hour Rate) = How much the Student Owes for the term
                     
                     How much the student owes – (prior fee assessment) = Potential Fee Adjustment/Refund
                     
                     Refund Policy – Rules & Exclusions
                     
                     The 100% fee adjustment period is applicable for students who withdraw from the University
                        or drop below full-time status prior to the first day of classes for the semester, not the first day that a particular
                           course meets.
                     
                     A full (100%) fee adjustment of mandatory fees will be provided to students called
                        to active military or National Guard service during the semester. Housing and meal
                        ticket charges may be prorated based on usage. A full (100%) fee adjustment will also
                        be provided for courses cancelled by the University or in the case of the death of
                        the student during the semester. Please go to the Financial Aid Web site for specific information on the return of federal financial aid funds for students
                        who withdraw from the University.
                     
                     
                     The 75% fee adjustment period is applicable for students who withdraw from the University
                        or drop below full-time status on the first day of classes for the term through the
                        fourteenth calendar day of the semester for fall and spring terms. The 75% fee adjustment
                        period is modified for summer and other short terms.
                     
                     
                     The 25% fee adjustment period is applicable for students who withdraw from the University
                        or drop below full-time status after the 75% fee adjustment period ends through 25%
                        of the full term. The 25% fee adjustment period is modified for summer and other short
                        terms.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: NO REFUND WILL BE PROVIDED AFTER THE APPROPRIATE 25% REFUND DATE.
                     
                     Students that have withdrawn during the term and who have received Federal Direct
                        Subsidized, Unsubsidized, Parent PLUS loans, Pell or SEOG grants, or Lottery Scholarships
                        will have their aid prorated based on the amount of time the student has attended.
                        All or part of their aid could be prorated resulting in the student owing funds to
                        the university. A hold will be placed on their account preventing them from receiving
                        grades/transcripts, and registering for future semesters until the balance is paid
                        in full.
                     
                     Students that have dropped or withdrawn during a refund period and received a payment
                        for tuition and fees from a discount, fee waiver, third party contract, financial
                        aid, or scholarship may have their refund credit applied back to the initial form
                        of payment.
                     
                     
                     Changes in courses involving the adding and/or dropping of the same number of credit
                        hours for the same part of term and processed on the same day may not require additional
                        fees nor be subject to any fee adjustments based on this policy, other than what may
                        result from dropping/adding courses from different programs that may have special
                        program fees (such as Fine Fine Arts, Business, Engineering, and/or Developmental
                        Studies Program courses).
                     
                     
                     A term (or semester) is defined as a "Spring" term, a "Fall" term, or a "Summer" term.
                        A Part-of-Term (POT) is defined as any part of the term/semester. For the Spring and
                        Fall terms, there is a "Full" POT that meets from August–December/January–May, the
                        first POT that meets from January–March/August–October, the second POT that meets
                        from March–May/October–December, and the TN eCampus Program (RODP) POT that overlaps
                        with the Full POT. Each term also has a "Law" POT. For the Summer term, there is a
                        Pre Session (MayMester), Full, First, Second, RODP, First Teacher and Second Teacher
                        POT.
                     
                     
                     Changes in courses from one POT to another POT within a major term (Fall/Spring/Summer)
                        will be subject to the fee adjustment periods and rates under this policy. Fee adjustments
                        beyond the specified dates/percentages indicated above will not be made for reasons
                        such as employee conflicts, health or medical problem, moving out of town, or other
                        reasons beyond the University's control or responsibility.
                     
                     
                     Any potential fee adjustment is calculated on the student's original total enrollment
                        fee assessment, less the registration fee amount due after course/schedule adjustment.
                        A refund would only be issued to the student if the newly adjusted amount of fees
                        is less than the amount that has been paid by the student. Therefore, students who
                        satisfy fees using the Installment Payment Plan may still have a balance due the University
                        for unpaid fee amounts despite their withdrawal from some or all of their classes.
                        To avoid late fees and ineligibility for the deferred payment plan in future terms,
                        the student should continue to make payment by each due date.  Remember, withdrawal
                        from classes does not negate the student's responsibility to pay the balance of fees
                        after the semester has begun.
                     
                     
                     Tuition and fee refunds will be processed beginning approximately twenty-one (21)
                        days after classes begin. The University will offset against proposed refunds any
                        amount owed by the student to the University. Students who have established an eRefund
                        account will have any refund direct deposited into the bank account on file in TigerXpress.
                        Students who have not established an eRefund account will have a paper check mailed
                        to the student's mailing address on file with the University.
