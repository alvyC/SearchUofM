                     This article sheds light on the role of information systems in product recovery management.
                     We first develop analytical models and then provide a numerical example to determine
                     under what conditions investments in Information-intensive Product Recovery Systems
                     (IPRS) are economically justifiable for manufacturers and when policy-makers need
                     to consider facilitating their implementation. The results of the analytical models
                     indicate that the recovery network (collection) structure and product characteristics
                     determine if precision improvements or increased sorting speed associated with IS
                     investments will lead to higher profit gains. Manufacturers should carefully assess
                     conflicting impacts of current manufacturing and recycling technology trends on the
                     value of IPRS. Implementing IPRS might end up reducing manufacturers' profits under
                     a highly time efficient decentralised collection structure. We show that negotiations
                     with competitors about IPRS implementation may lead to a win–win situation and allow
                     consumers to enjoy the lowest product price if the binding force of the agreement
                     is strong. Otherwise, some manufacturers follow free-rider strategies. This article
                     has immediate application to manufacturers' IS strategy and to government policy-makers
                     considering investing in and/or structuring product recovery closed-loop supply chain
                     processes within their jurisdictions. It also opens a potential stream of research
                     concerning the role of IPRS to automate, informate and transform closed-loop supply
                     chains for eco-efficiency.
