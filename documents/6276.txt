                     Dr. M. Shah Jahan
                     
                                                        
                     
                     
                     
                     The focus of the Biomaterials Research Laboratory is to understand microscopic processes
                        that bring about macroscopic changes in material properties. The lab employs a number
                        of spectroscopic techniques to evaluate the production of free radicals in sterilized
                        implants. This work has led to changes in the manufacturing processes used by the
                        orthopedic industry. Over the last decade, the lab has expanded to provide analytical
                        services for most of the world's orthopedic manufacturers.

                     The laboratory has a state-of-the-art Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Radical Analyzer
                        (Bruker Instruments). The ESR technique is unique in its ability to elucidate molecular
                        defect sites in various materials, which are often pre-cursors to material property
                        degradation. The laboratory also employs a number of optical emission and spectroscopic
                        techniques, including UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometry, thermoluminescence and radiation-induced
                        emission. These experimental techniques can be carried out at material temperatures
                        from 25 to 500 Kelvin.
                     
                     
                     These powerful scientific tools allow researchers to put together a fundamental understanding
                        of material behavior in various environments. The ultimate result is a predictive
                        model that can be used to improve man-made materials like those used in hip and knee
                        joint replacements. Researchers work closely with colleagues at Los Alamos National
                        Laboratory, providing experimentation and expertise to assist with the US Nuclear
                        Stockpile Stewardship program.

                              ESR can directly detect free radicals. A free radical is a molecule with one or more
                                 missing electrons causing it to become highly reactive. Free Radicals can speed up
                                 oxidation and aging.

                              Luminescence is emission of light. Thermoluminescence is a form of luminescence that
                                 is exhibited by materials when previously absorbed energy from electromagnetic radiation
                                 or other ionizing radiation is re-emitted as light when the material is heated. This
                                 is a good method to determine if something has been exposed to certain quantities
                                 of radiation, or to determine how old something is.

                        of free radical research also involves studying the amount of radiation exposure,
                        such as from a nuclear reactor incident like that in Japan.
