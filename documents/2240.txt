                     The BIT PhD Program at the University of Memphis is one of the largest BIT Programs
                           in the US and the only BIT PhD Program in the State of Tennessee.
                     
                     Our BIT group prides itself on maintaining a supportive research and teaching atmosphere.
                        PhD students who join our program become actively involved in research with partnered
                        faculty from the first semester.
                     
                     
                     Our faculty is diverse in their interests while publishing state-of-the-art applied
                        and theoretical research on the top tier BIT academic journals; focusing on the AIS-6
                        journals: MIS Quarterly , Information Systems Research , Journal of MIS , Journal of the AIS , E uropean Journal of Information Systems , and Information Systems Journal . We are supportive of multiple lines of inquiry including managerial, behavioral
                        and technical topics and we employ empirical, modeling, experimental, qualitative,
                        design science and econometric methodologies.
                     
                     
                     Our PhD program in BIT benefits from a mix of newer faculty members complementing
                        our existing strong cadre of senior faculty. Our mix of faculty (diverse interests
                        and accomplishments) is very strong with great connections to the Memphis business
                        community through such programs as STEP and CAST  (tied closely to FedEx Institute of Technology) for empirical research that has direct
                        applications to practice. The senior faculty has nurtured these business relationships
                        for many years and the newer faculty brings energy and the latest methods and ideas
                        to the group.
                     
                     
                     Our program nurtures our students' innate curiosity while it provides them many priceless
                        resources to answer the questions they ask. The department's faculty currently hold,
                        or have held, editorial leadership positions at ISR, MISQ, JAIS, EJIS, MISQ Executive, Journal of Data Base Management and The Data Base for Advances in Information Systems . The Center for Innovative Technology Management at the University of Memphis also
                        serves as a major research opportunity and support connection between the BIT Department
                        and the many companies with IT organizations in the Memphis area. In addition, a weekly
                        research Colloquium brings our active research team (faculty and PhD students) together
                        to learn and support each other as we engage in research. Guests are always invited
                        to sit in any of our Friday Colloquiums and meet our faculty and PhD students, including
                        Dr. Ritu Agarwal, current Editor-in-Chief of Information System Research, and Dr.
                        Detmar Straub, former Editor-in-Chief of MIS Quarterly.
                     
                     
                     Our PhD students are very active and productive. For example, in 2010, we had 8 students
                        working as volunteers at the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS
                        - top MIS academic conference in the world) and we had three students' papers appearing
                        in the ICIS Proceedings. During the training program, students will master the core
                        material, gain exposure to the broader aspects of information systems, and expert
                        in at least one specialized area of information systems while working with many top
                        tier research faculties in the field.
