                     Steps to Enroll
                     
                     Online classes are engaging and convenient but they do require high levels of self-discipline
                        and motivation. To ensure a successful online experience, it is essential to have
                        regular, reliable, access to the appropriate computer equipment and a high-speed internet
                        connection. You must also have an active University of Memphis e-mail account.

                     The enrollment process for online students is identical to that of on-campus students.
                        Just follow these steps:
                     
                     
                     Step 1. Complete an application.
                     
                     Complete and submit an application for admission. Please note that some programs require
                        a special application. You should review the information for the undergraduate or
                        graduate program that is of interest to you.
                     
                     
                     Step 2. Send transcripts.
                     
                     Once your application is submitted, please contact any institutions that you have
                        previously attended to request official copies of your transcripts. Ask the institution
                        to send your transcripts to:
                     
                     
                     Office of Admissions 101 John Wilder Tower The University of Memphis Memphis, TN 38152
                     
                     
                     The Admissions Office will notify you within two weeks of receiving your application.
                     
                     Step 3. Apply for financial aid.
                     
                     Apply for financial aid as soon as possible! It is a lengthy approval process. eRate
                        fees will be assessed for all out-of-state students who are enrolled solely in online
                        courses for the semester that fees are incurred. This rate will consist of the in-state
                        Maintenance Fees plus 50% of that Maintenance Fee. Students will not have to pay on-campus
                        program or online course fees, but they will have to pay college- or program-specific
                        fees as noted on the Bursar's fee charts.
                     
                     
                     Please note: If the student enrolls in any on-campus courses, the full out-of-state
                        maintenance fees will be assessed for all course sections, whether they are online
                        or on-campus.
                     
                     
                     Step 4. Meet with your Advisor.
                     
                     After you've been admitted, meet with your academic advisor. Undecided majors should
                        contact the Academic Counseling Center. Decided majors contact your chosen academic
                        department.
                     
                     
                     If you are a full-time online student, complete an exemption request provided through
                        Student Health Services. Without an approved exemption request or documentation of
                        current immunizations, students will be restricted when attempting to register.
                     
                     
                     Register * for your classes via the "Student" tab in the myMemphis portal. Be sure
                        to read all of the footnotes about your classes! A registration guide will be mailed
                        to you with your acceptance letter from the Admissions office, or you can find it
                        under our links of interest.
                     
                     
                     Be sure to pay your fees. In the myMemphis portal, check your Account$ tab frequently
                        for balances due or messages from the Bursar regarding your account.
