                     The Nutritional Science concentration provides individuals with an excellent opportunity
                        to pursue their interests in understanding the roles of nutrition in health and disease,
                        development and aging, and in athletic performance. The objective of the Nutrition
                        Science program is to ensure that our graduates obtain an advanced and comprehensive
                        education in nutrition along with research training that includes experimental design
                        and analysis, laboratory skills, and experiences in scientific writing and presentations.
                        Interdisciplinary opportunities exist with faculty in biological sciences, chemistry
                        and biochemistry, exercise and sport science, and psychology, as well as with faculty
                        at other institutions within the Memphis area. Students have opportunities to study
                        the influences of nutrition at levels of organization ranging from genes to intact
                        organisms. Although many students will have an interest in human nutrition, there
                        are also opportunities to study the nutrition of companion, exotic, and production
                        animals.
                     
                     
                     The master’s degree in Nutrition Science is a 33-credit hour program that offers a
                        diversity of courses so students can develop a curriculum that is matched to their
                        specific interests. A research project culminating in a formal thesis is required.
                        Students entering the program will need to identify a research advisor who will assist
                        in forming a graduate committee that will provide guidance in identifying courses
                        and will assist in the design, performance, analysis, and interpretation of their
                        research. Students completing the degree program will be well-prepared for advanced
                        graduate study (PhD or MD), as well as for employment opportunities in academics,
                        private industry, or government. Moreover, the multidisciplinary training available
                        will position graduates of the program to be leaders in the field of nutrition.
                     
                     
                     The research project students will complete typifies the motto of the University of
                        Memphis:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Dreamers: Students are expected to develop with their advisor and committee a research
                           project that is novel and will add to nutrition knowledge.
                        
                        
                        Thinkers: Students will need to think about the design and performance of their research
                           and the analysis and interpretation of their findings.
                        
                        
                        Doers: Importantly, students must be active participants in all phases of their research.
                        
                     
                     
                     Nutrition is a broad field that spans multiple disciplines. Similarly, students entering
                        the Nutrition Science program may have had previous training in various fields, bringing
                        a diversity of backgrounds, expertise, and experiences. We are not searching for students
                        with specific backgrounds. Instead, we are looking for students who want to be innovative,
                        have a desire to learn, want to explore new areas of study, and to become leaders
                        in the field of nutrition. We invite applications from all such students
                     
                     
                     Applicants must have a minimum of a bachelor’s degree with some coursework in fields
                        of study relevant to biological, chemical, or nutritional sciences. Applicants will
                        be selected for admission to the program based on a combination of grade point average,
                        graduate record examination (GRE) scores within the past five years, a narrative statement
                        that includes career goals, and letters of reference.
