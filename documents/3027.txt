                     The University of Memphis Faculty Ombudsperso n is an independent, confidential, impartial (neutral), and informal resource, chosen
                        from the UM faculty, who is available to all members of the University faculty, including
                        all tenured, tenure-track, clinical, research, and one-year instructors, to facilitate
                        dispute resolution through cooperation, consensus, education and mediation.
                     
                     
                     The major function of the Ombudsperson is to provide confidential and informal assistance
                        to faculty of the institution. Serving as an independent, impartial neutral, the Ombudsperson
                        is neither an advocate, attorney, or officer of formal notice, for any individual
                        nor the University, but rather, serves as an advocate for fairness, equity, and compliance
                        with policies and due process. The Ombudsperson acts as a source of information and
                        referral, aids in answering questions, and assists in the resolution of concerns and
                        critical situations. More specifically, the Ombudsperson engenders awareness and skill
                        development in the areas of conflict resolution, communication, team building and
                        civility.
                     
                     
                     Ombudsperson's activities assist the faculty to resolve complaints that have not risen
                        to the level of formal grievances, with the goal of promoting alternatives to adversarial
                        processes. The office supplements, but does not replace, the university's existing
                        resources for conflict resolution. Staff and student conflicts should be directed
