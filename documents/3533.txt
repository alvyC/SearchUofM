                     JD/MPH PROGRAM
                     
                     Public health, public policy and issues of health disparities are at the forefront
                        of many of America's unresolved social problems. Rising health care costs pose a growing
                        threat to the economy, while for some access to even the most basic health care is
                        tenous. Lawyers play a central role in society's approach to these public health issues.
                        However, their effectiveness is frequently limited by an inadequate knowledge of public
                        health matters. To close this educational gap, the University of Memphis has created
                        the JD/MPH dual degree program. The program offers students the opportunity to pursue
                        the JD (juris doctor) and MPH (master of public health) degrees simultaneously. Students
                        will have the ability to complete both degrees in four years of full-time study, a
                        year less than it would take to complete each degree separately.
                     
                     
                     The goal of the JD/MPH program is to prepare and train students to apply law and policy
                        to benefit public health. The dual degree allows law students to combine in-depth
                        advocacy and policy skills learned in the UofM's JD program with the population health
                        perspective gained in the MPH program to address policy and advocacy needs at the
                        community level.
                     
                     
                     JD/MPH ADMISSIONS AND PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
                     
                     Candidates must meet the entrance requirements for both the Juris Doctor and Master
                        of Public Health degree programs, and must notify both programs at the time of application
                        that s/he intends to pursue the dual JD/MPH degree. Students will be admitted into
                        each program separately, and completion of one degree is not contingent upon completion
                        of both.
                     
                     
                     The MPH is a 42-credit hour degree program, and the JD/MPH program will allow up to
                        nine (9) credit hours of law courses for shared credit. Students must have a grade
                        of C or higher for the law school courses that are to be credited toward the MPH degree;
                        grades for the shared courses will not be counted in the GPA for the MPH degree. For

                        of Law, the University of Memphis Graduate School, and the MPH Program. Please click
