                        about working with college students in various functional areas, including but not
                        limited to housing, admissions, student life, orientation, academic advising and judicial
                        affairs. Students are able to tailor the program to fit individual goals and interests.
                        Opportunities for practical experience are available through internships and graduate
                        assistantships. Students are also encouraged to continue their professional preparation
                        at the doctoral level.
                     
                     
                     The Program of Studies provides an overview of required coursework for completion
                        of the degree. Most students in our program have already established successful careers.
                        Therefore, classes are scheduled in the evenings and on weekends to meet the needs
                        of the working adult.
                     
                     
                     Prior to graduation, students are required to produce a portfolio of the products
                        created in the courses which demonstrate specific program competencies. To view a
                        sample portfolio and for more information on the details of the portfolio submission
