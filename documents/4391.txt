                        Several faculty in Department of Biological Sciences have provided weekend educational
                        tours on the natural history of the Chicksaw Bluffs. These events have attracted local
                        community members and individuals from the city of Memphis.

                     The Department of Biological Sciences uses the MBS to teach classes during the summer
                        semester. These courses incorporate lecture, data collection in the surrounding environments,
                        and laboratory analysis onsite at the MBS. Several courses, including those from the
                        Dept. of Geography, use the MFBS as a staging site for numerous class field projects
                        along the surrounding floodplain rivers. Several instructors have established long-term
                        study sites that are revisted each year or each semester. The long-term study sites
                        will continue to produce data of relevance to other studies and these data will be
                        made available to other researchers and classes upon request.

                     The Department of Biological Sciences has been involved in providing experiential
                        learning events for students from local schools and for individuals from the Memphis
                        metropolitan area. Several different trails on the MBS property explore the habitats
                        often encountered in western Tennessee. Shelby State Forest has also permitted extensive
                        use of their properties in these learning events.
