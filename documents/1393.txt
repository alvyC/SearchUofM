                     Our wireless campus.
                     
                     Your wireless network on campus, uofm , offers all the computing services that the wired network does with fast and reliable
                        data connection speeds of up to 54Mbps.
                     
                     
                     Who can use it?
                     
                     All University of Memphis students, faculty, and staff with a UUID and password can
                        log into the uofm wireless network.
                     
                     
                     What if I'm not a student, staff, or faculty member?
                     
                     Those without an active UUID and password can use the uofm-guest network.
                     
                     
                     Where can I use it?
                     
                     All main campus, academic buildings, and dormitories have Wi-Fi capabilities. However,
                        due to the aging infrastructure in some of our buildings, the Wi-Fi signal may be
                        limited. If you have trouble accessing the Wi-Fi in a building, please report your
                        experience to the ITS Service Desk at 678-8888.
                     
                     
                     What is SafeConnect?
                     
                     The University of Memphis uses the SafeConnect product for our Network Access Control
                        (NAC). This system helps in keeping our campus computer network secure. To access
                        the uofm Network, you must use the SafeConnect client.
                     
                     
                     How can I get started?
                     
                     Note: Laptops and desktop computers also need to have anti-virus software installed and
                        have an update for Windows activated. If these are not done, your computer will receive
                        a warning message, and after a 72-hour period, not be allowed to connect.
