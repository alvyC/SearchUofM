                     Our mission is to address complex healthcare issues, focusing on emerging issues that
                        affect Memphis, Shelby County, and the State of Tennessee.
                     
                     
                     The Methodist Le Bonheur Center for Healthcare Economics (MLCHE) was established in
                        March 2003 with a grant from Methodist Healthcare and Le Bonheur Systems, Inc. MLCHE
                        focuses on issues of efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in healthcare through a
                        variety of research, internship, instruction, and public service programs.
                     
                     
                     We are located in the Fogelman College of Business and Economics at the University
                        of Memphis. Working with entities internal and external to The University of Memphis,
                        we provide a physical and administrative structure to facilitate the study of health
                        care and its economic impact.
                     
                     
                     Why a Center for Healthcare Economics?
                     
                     The health system touches everyone, yet health care seems always to be in crisis.
                        In many ways, Tennessee faces the same challenges as the rest of the nation: an aging
                        population, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, and the resulting increases
                        in healthcare costs. The cost problem is compounded by a delivery system that allocates
                        healthcare dollars in a haphazard way, with too little money spent on health promotion
                        and prevention and too much on expensive procedures for treating acute illnesses that
                        may be preventable.
                     
                     
                     As costs continue to escalate, employers are forced to cut back on health benefits
                        for their current and retired employees or sacrifice other forms of compensation.
                        Publicly funded programs face similar challenges. TennCare, Tennessee's Medicaid program,
                        has been in a constant state of flux since its inception as the State has struggled
                        to cover its neediest citizens while maintaining a balanced budget. These and other
                        pressing problems require extensive research to identify their root causes so that
                        effective policy solutions can be developed.
