                     Important Announcement: Change in Password Reset Process
                     
                     In an effort to enhance security of passwords and protect University data, ITS will
                        implement a change in its Password Reset service. Effective immediately, the ITS Service
                        Desk (Tier 1) will no longer, administratively, change passwords. All UofM affiliates
                        (faculty, staff, students, alumni, former students, etc.) will be encouraged to visit
                        the University's self-service Identity Management website located at https://iam.memphis.edu . Here, you can initialize your account, reset your password, retrieve your UUID,
                        and answer your security questions to regain access to your account.
                     
                     
                     In addition, remember these important tips to ensure your data is secure: • Never share your password with anyone. This includes a UofM employee, friend, or
                        relative. • Beware of phishing emails that attempt to lure you to malicious websites. • Watch for email notifications about your password changing. If you did not change
                        your password, please contact the Service Desk immediately. • Never respond to an email request for your username and password, or any other request
                        to "verify" your account.

                     Alert: Malicious Adobe Email Attachment Circulating On-Campus
                     
                     On Tuesday, January 26th, 2016, a number of UofM users received a message purporting
                        to be from the Adobe Creative Cloud service with a Subject: line of "Adobe Invoice" . The message contained an attachment called "invoice.doc" , that, when opened, would attempt to connect to a remote server and install malicious
                        software on the recipient's computer.
                     
                     
                     The remote server has since been taken offline and ITS staff are working with units
                        who may have had computers that were impacted by the malicious attachment. If you
                        received one of the "Adobe Invoice" emails with the invoice.doc attachment, please delete the email message and do not
                        attempt to open the attachment.
                     
                     
                     If you opened the attachment, please contact your LSP or the ITS Service Desk by phone
                        at (901) 678-8888 or via email at umtech@memphis.edu for further assistance.
