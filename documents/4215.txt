                     Sponsor->Prime recipient->Subrecipient
                     
                     The Sponsor is the originator of the funds.
                     
                     
                     The Prime Recipient is the legal entity who receives the award directly from the sponsor, the holder
                        of the prime award. Organizations can be recipients; individuals cannot. The Prime

                        and audit requirements of a subrecipient.

                        the work as an independent contractor.

                        A Subrecipient: Has a responsibility to carry out a portion of the grant program as defined in the
                           Subcontract, Has its performance measured against the grant program objectives, Has responsibility for programmatic decision making, Has responsibility for adherence to applicable federal program compliance requirements.

                        A Consultant Individuals generally render services on a "work for hire" basis (assign all tangible
                           and intangible property rights to University of Memphis) A contract for consultant services does not generally require the inclusion (flow
                           down) of the terms and conditions contained in the University of Memphis prime award. Consultants are retained in accordance with the University Independent Contractor
                           Policy. Under this standard, the University of Memphis would not direct or retain
                           control over a consultant. An employer-employee relationship exists when the business
                           has a great deal of control over the work, including providing regular supervision,
                           decision-making and guidance. In this situation, the person should be classified as
                           an employee. Consultants must agree to abide by the University's Intellectual Property policies
                           by signing a Participation Agreement.
