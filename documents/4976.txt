                     Overview:
                     
                     The proposed project will expand access to virtual internships, a powerful technology
                        for incorporating professional STEM experience into STEM education. Syntern virtual
                        internships have been shown to improve STEM learning outcomes and increase students'
                        interest in STEM topics.
                     
                     
                     An authorware system will allow teachers to integrate them more effectively into their
                        curricula and reach more students. By enabling STEM content developers to design and
                        customize their own virtual internships, the Internship-inator will encourage pedagogical
                        innovation, effectively expanding the number of developers who refine and disseminate
                        this learning intervention. This research and development effort will also build a
                        network of teachers, curriculum designers, researchers, and educational technology
                        developers to enhance existing technologies, enable teachers and others to customize
                        STEM learning technologies for their curricula, provide training and support for in-service
                        teachers, and create a repository of virtual internships, curricular materials, and
                        other resources.
