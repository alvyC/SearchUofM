                     Inter-organizational cost management is a strategic cost management approach to managing
                        costs that span organizational boundaries in supply chains. Drawing on the resource-based
                        view of the firm, we develop a model to predict which inter-related resources might
                        enable companies to manage inter-organizational costs. We test this model using a
                        survey of managerial accountants whose organizations are part of a supply chain. Using
                        structural equation modeling, we conclude that the resources of internal electronic
                        integration, external electronic integration, internal cost management, and absorptive
                        capacity play significant direct and indirect roles in the development of an inter-organizational
                        cost management (IOCM) resource. We find that these resources are inter-related and
                        together are useful in enabling companies to ultimately benefit from managing inter-organizational
                        costs. We find in particular the importance of relational resources associated with
                        absorptive capacity in the development of an IOCM resource. Our research contributes
                        to theory and practice by explaining how specific resources can be combined in allowing
                        companies to better manage inter-organizational costs.
