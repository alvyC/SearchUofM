	   Memphis Alumni Email

As a University of Memphis Alumni Association member, you have the benefit of
accessing your @memphis.edu email address !* 
*Please note: our Email365 benefit will be changing soon in accordance with a proposed new University policy. 


    University Committee Proposal: Only current faculty, staff and students will have access to an @memphis.edu email address
    Alumni Association members will be able to create an @memphisalumni.org email account
    UMAR members will be able to create a @memphisretirees.org email account
    60 day transition period before @memphis.edu email accounts are closed
    

Additional information to follow as it becomes available.
____________________________________________________________________________
To take advantage of this benefit, you must be a current Association member . Annual
members will be given up to 30 days after their membership expires to renew before
the email account is deactivated. If you have any questions, please contact the Alumni
Association at alumniassociation@memphis.edu . 

To activate your Email365 account, you must first activate your myMemphis account
(if you do not have a current Memphis username and password) by clicking here . Next complete these simple steps:

1. Visit iam.memphis.edu

2. Log in using your UUID and Password

3. Select: Enable “Email365” account access

4. Press the “ Confirm ” button.

Please allow up to 20 minutes for email account activation. Visit ummail.memphis.edu
to login to your Memphis.edu inbox.

*Current University of Memphis employees: If you are involuntarily terminated from
the University, you will no longer have access to your @memphis.edu email account.
Please contact your HR representative regarding this policy.

Forwarding your Email
Use this option if you would like to redirect your email to an off-campus email service
or if you would like to revert your email delivery back to the centralized campus
email service.

2. Log in using your UUID and Password.

3. Select: Modify Email Preferences

Not an Alumni Association member?
JOIN NOW! After joining, your membership can take two or more business days to activate. Until
it is activated, you will not be given the option in iAM to sign up for Email365. You can check your membership status by calling 901.678.2586.


Troubleshooting
I just renewed my Alumni Association membership and followed the instructions above,
but I do not see the option to enable Email365.


    Please note: Once you join the Alumni Association, it can take two or more business
    days for your membership to process in the system. You will not be able to activate
    your email account until that time.
    

I have signed up for Email365 but am unable to access my @memphis.edu account. How
do I fix this?

    One possibility is that your password has expired. The University has enacted a policy
    that all passwords must be changed every 6 months. To change your password, go to
    iam.memphis.edu . Select "Forgot Password" and follow the steps to set a new password. If you are
    unable to remember the answers to your security questions, from iam.memphis.edu select "Initialize Your Account." You will then need to contact the Helpdesk at 901.678.8888
    to receive your 10 digit code.
    
    University of Memphis employees: If you are involuntarily terminated from
    the University, you will no longer have access to your @memphis.edu email account.
    Please contact your HR representative regarding this policy.
    
    For additional technical problems, please contact the Helpdesk at 901.678.8888.
