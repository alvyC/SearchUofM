                     Churchman [1971] defines inquiry as an activity that produces knowledge. He examines
                     the epistemologies of five schools of philosophy from the perspective of general systems
                     theory, asking the question as to whether each is suitable as the basis for the design
                     of computer-based "inquiring systems." He considers systems design and design theory
                     in some detail. We believe that Churchman's inquiring systems can form the basis for
                     the design of knowledge management systems and that the IS research community has
                     hardly tapped the potential of inquiring systems in that regard. Mason and Mitroff
                     [1973] brought inquiring systems into the IS literature early on, essentially making
                     the work endogenous to the field. We argue that building on inquiring systems can
                     contribute to developing IS as a discipline by maintaining continuity in research
                     and developing a theory that IS can call its own. We believe that the lack of use
                     of Churchman's work may be due to its lack of visibility in recent years and attempt
                     to remedy that by summarizing the basics of the inquirers in some detail, trying not
                     to interpret, but to remain faithful to the original. The paper encourages readers
                     to study the original and develop their own notion of how the inquirers might be used
                     in knowledgemanagement work. There are probably as many different perspectives on
                     how inquiring systems could support KMS as there are IS researchers willing to study
                     them. We would like to encourage a proliferation of such perspectives.
