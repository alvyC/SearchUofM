                     The Creative Writing MFA brings together nationally recognized authors and a diverse,
                        carefully selected group of students in one of the most culturally rich cities in
                        the United States. Graduates of the program have gone on to publish books, win awards,
                        and teach in universities.
                     
                     
                     Students work in small groups with faculty to study fiction, creative nonfiction,
                        and poetry. Students may have opportunities to teach at the UofM.
