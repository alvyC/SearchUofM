                        Applying design theory in creating instance design. Information Technology & People,
                        28(3), 529-543.
                     
                     
                     Purpose
                     
                     – The purpose of this paper is to suggest that translating a design theory (DT) into
                        practice (e.g. creating an instance design artifact (IDA)) is hardly straight-forward
                        and requires substantial creativity. Specifically the authors suggest that adopting
                        a DT embodies a creativity passdown effect in which the creative thinking of a team
                        of design theorist(s) inherent in DT invokes a creative mind of a team of artifact
                        instance designer(s) in creating an IDA. In this study, the authors empirically investigate
                        the creativity passdown effect through an action case in which a DT (DT nexus) was
                        applied in creating an IDA (multi-outsourcing decision-making tool).
                     
                     
                     Design/methodology/approach
                     
                     – The case methodology applied here is described as an action case. An action case
                        is a hybrid research approach that combines action research and interpretive case
                        approaches. It combines intervention and interpretation in order to achieve both change
                        and understanding. It is a form of soft field experiment with less emphasis on iteration
                        and learning and more on trial and making. The approach is holistic in philosophy,
                        and prediction is not emphasized. The intervention in the case was that of an instance
                        designer team introducing a previously published DT as a basis for creating an IDA.
                     
                     
                     Findings
                     
                     – The experience in the action case suggests that using a DT in creating an IDA may
                        encourage design thinking, and in certain way increase its power and practical relevance
                        by fostering the creative mind of instance designers. Indeed, DTs provide a scientific
                        basis for dealing with an instance problem, and this evokes the creativity mind of
                        instance designers. Without such a scientific basis, it is a lot more challenging
                        for instance artifact designers to deal with instance problems.
                     
                     
                     Research limitations/implications
                     
                     – This study contributes to the literature concerning design science research, as
                        it challenges the notion that adopting scientific design knowledge limits creativity
                        inherent in creating IDA by illustrating creative elements involved in adopting DT
                        as a basis for creating IDAs.
                     
                     
                     Practical implications
                     
                     – This study offers implications to practice, as it provides new insights regarding
                        how DT can be used in instance design activities.
                     
                     
                     Originality/value
                     
                     – A report of this research previously appeared as a conference paper. However, the
                        attached journal version has been completely rewritten to additionally contribute
                        to the literature concerning design science research beyond the conference version.
                        More specifically, in this version, the authors conceptualize adopting a DT to build
                        an IDA as a theoretical basis, and the authors challenge the notion that adopting
                        scientific design knowledge limits creativity inherent in creating IDA by illustrating
                        creative elements involved in executing DT as a basis for creating IDAs.
