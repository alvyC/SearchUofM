                     Frequently Asked Questions about   Tiger  Learning Communities
                     
                     How do I decide which community is best for me?
                     
                     Explore your interests! You do not have to take a community related to your major.
                        You may want to explore the visual arts or brush up on your communication skills.
                        Read the descriptions of the communities under Current TLC  to see which appeal to you. When you meet with your academic advisor discuss your
                        options. He or she can help you make a decision.
                     
                     
                     What is the difference among the learning communities?
                     
                     Some communities are tailored to specific majors, for example nursing and business.
                        Each community will be focused around different career paths, interests areas, and
                        social issues designed to appeal to incoming freshmen.
                     
                     
                     Is being in a learning community different than "regular" college life?
                     
                     No! A learning community provides some structure in your first semester of college.
                        With a set schedule and cohort of classmates you immediately connect with other students
                        and faculty who are invested in your college success. In some courses your learning
                        community cohort will be a part of a larger lecture course, however, your professors
                        know who is part of the cohort and integrates your community theme into assignments.
                     
                     
                     Do learning communities last the entire year or can I sign up in another semester?
                     
                     No. Tiger Learning Communities are only offered during the Fall semester for first-time,
                        full-time students. 
                     
                     
                     Can I also be in the Honors program?
                     
                     Yes! You can enroll in any TLC and we offer some learning communities specifically
                        for Honors students. Check them out under Current TLC. Be sure to speak with your academic advisor to be sure to coordinate your plan of
                        study.
                     
                     
                     Can I enroll in a Honors specific community if I'm not in the Honors program?
                     
                     No. You must be a honors student in order to enroll in any of our honors specific
                        communities.
                     
                     
                     What will students in a learning community do?
                     
                     In a learning community students will study together, collaborate on projects, and
                        explore a common area of interest. Students will participate in a variety of enrichment
                        activities related to their community theme. In the past students have taken a walking
                        tour of the historic Cooper-Young neighborhood, visited Stax studio, and painted a
                        mural on campus.
                     
                     
                     Do I have to live on campus?
                     
                     No. TLC's do not require you to live on campus or with other members of your community.
                        If you are interested in living in a community on campus, please see Living Learning Communities. 
                     
                     What classes do students in a learning community take together?
                     
                     Each learning community has 20-30 students. The students will take the "packaged"
                        schedule of 3-4 classes together.
                     
                     
                     Do I have to take all of the "packaged" courses listed?
                     
                     Yes. In order to have the full learning community experience, students take all of
                        the "packaged" courses. The professors in the community work together to link syllabi
                        and assignments around the theme to fully engage students across courses.
                     
                     
                     All of the communities have a Freshman Seminar, Honors Forum, or an ACAD. What is
                           that?
                     
                     The Freshman Seminar, Honors Forum, and ACAD courses are designed to tie the community
                        together. Though students will be completing related assignments in the other courses,
                        the Seminar, Forum, or ACAD is where the theme of the community is brought full circle.
                        The ACAD courses are also designed to provide freshmen with the skills to succeed
                        in college (find out more by visiting the ACAD 1100 website).
                     
                     
                     What learning communities are available?
                     
                     Take a look at the Current TLC  page. Here you will find the most up to date information on what communities are
                        available in the Fall and what communities are still available once registration opens.
                     
                     
                     How do you sign up for a learning community?
                     
                     Check out the How to Join page. Discuss Tiger Learning Communities with your advisor and determine the community
                        that is right for you. Permits need to be obtained in order to register for a TLC.
                        Your advisor will help you with that process!
