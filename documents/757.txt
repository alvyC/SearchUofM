                     Your U-Number is your unique University identification number. It consists of the
                        letter "U" followed by 8 digits. You should include this number, rather than your
                        social security number, in all correspondence or contact with the University--e-mail,
                        letter, phone, FAX, etc. Do not supply your social security number unless specifically
                        asked by a University employee who has a legitimate business need to know it.
                     
                     
                     Your U-Number is also referred to as your University ID#, Banner ID#, or even Student
                        ID#.
