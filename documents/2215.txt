                     What is Biomedical Engineering?
                     
                     Biomedical Engineering is a broad field that focuses on improving health with the
                        use of engineering principles. For example, designing new implants for those who suffer
                        from hip fractures, developing tools sensing electrical signals to detect heart problems,
                        discovering drugs to fight cancer and other illnesses are all possible job descriptions
                        for BME graduates.
