                              Soil water content (SWC) is a critical attribute in precision irrigation. Direct measurements are costly and relative sparse, so there is interest in methods to predict SWC at unsampled sites from sampled data. The precision of such predictions can be improved, if covariates are incorporated into the predictor. To do that, two efficient ways are: (1) linear mixed effect model (LME), in which the spatial process is obtained by splitting the total variability in a systematic term or mean effect, a spatially correlated component and a random noise, and (2) kriging with external drift (KED), a nonstationary geostatistical technique, assuming covariates to have a linear effect on target variable. Geoelectric sensors provide noninvasive information on soil. Their outputs are quite sensitive to SWC; therefore, they can be used as covariates in SWC predictor. The objective of this work was to compare LME and KED, based on geophysical sensing, to estimate shallow SWC. The surveys were conducted in a south-eastern Italy field, using GPR at two frequencies, 600 and 1,600 MHz, and EMI. Volumetric soil water contents were measured with a Time Domain Reflectometer at 96 locations. Three LMEs, using three correlation functions (spherical, exponential, and Gaussian), were used and compared with KED using a set of cross-validation criteria. The mixed models showed a quite similar behavior even if exponential model outperformed the other two. The covariates used in the mixed models and in KED predictor were different and the results of cross-validation showed a slight out-performance of KED.

                              The wavelet transform and the linear mixed model with spectral tempering are two methods which have been used to analyse soil data without assumptions of stationarity in the variance. In this paper both methods are compared on a single data set on soil pH where marked changes in parent material are expected to result in non-stationary variability. The two methods both identified the dominant feature of the data, a reduction in the variance of pH over Chalk parent material, and also identified less pronounced effects of other parent material contrasts. However, there were differences between the results which can be attributed to (i) the wavelet transform's analysis on discrete scales, for which local features are resolved with scale-dependent resolution; (ii) differences between the partition of variation into, respectively, smooth or detail components of the wavelet analysis and fixed or random effects of the linear mixed model ; (iii) the fact that the identification of changes in the variance is done sequentially for the wavelet transform and simultaneously in the linear mixed model .

                              Flash floods represent one of the most destructive natural hazards in the Mediterranean region. These floods result from very intense and spatially heterogeneous rainfall events. Distributed hydrological models are valuable tools to study these phenomena and increase our knowledge on the main processes governing the generation and propagation of floods over large spatial scales. They are generally built using a bottom-up approach that generalizes small-physics representations of processes. However, top-down or data-driven approach is increasingly shown to provide also valuable knowledge. A simplified semi-distributed continuous hydrological model , named SIMPLEFLOOD, was developed, based on the simple dynamical system approach (SDSA) proposed by Kirchner (WRR, 2009, 45, W02429), and applied to the Ardeche catchment in France (2388 km (super 2) ). This data-driven method assumes that discharge at the outlet of a given catchment can be expressed as a function only of catchment storage. It leads to a 3-parameter nonlinear model according to rainfall and runoff observations. This model was distributed over sub-catchments and coupled with a kinematic wave based flow propagation module. The parameters were estimated by discharge recession analyses at several gauged stations. Parameter regionalization was conducted using a Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Hierarchical Classification on Principal Component (HCPC) in order to find relationships between the SDSA approach and catchments characteristics. Geology was found to be the main predictor of hydrological response variability and model parameters were regionalized according to the dominant geology. The SIMPLEFLOOD model was applied for a 12-year continuous simulation over the Ardeche catchment. Four flash flood events were also selected for further analysis. The simulated hydrographs were compared with the observations at 11 gauging stations with catchment size ranging from 17 to 2300 km (super 2) . The results show a good performance of the model for the continuous and flash flood events occurring under wet conditions, whereas the model underestimates discharge for events occurring after a long dry period. The simple modeling approach provided interesting insight into the Ardeche catchment functioning and offers perspective for a better simulation of flash floods, mainly under wet conditions.

                              We propose an estimation approach to analyse correlated functional data, which are observed on unequal grids or even sparsely. The model we use is a functional linear mixed model , a functional analogue of the linear mixed model . Estimation is based on dimension reduction via functional principal component analysis and on mixed model methodology. Our procedure allows the decomposition of the variability in the data as well as the estimation of mean effects of interest, and borrows strength across curves. Confidence bands for mean effects can be constructed conditionally on estimated principal components. We provide R -code implementing our approach in an online appendix. The method is motivated by and applied to data from speech production research.

                              A mixed - model assembly U-line is a flexible production system capable of manufacturing a variety of similar models , and it has become popular as an important component of the just-in-time production system. However, it poses new challenges for the optimal design of assembly lines because both the task assignment and the production sequence affect the workload variance among workstations. As a consequence, this paper addresses the line balancing problem and the model sequencing problem jointly and proposes a 0–1 stochastic programming model . In this model , task times are assumed to be stochastic variables independently distributed with normal distributions and the objective is to minimise the expectation of work overload time for a given combination of cycle time and number of workstations. To solve the problem, a simulated annealing-based algorithm is developed, which can also be used to minimise the absolute deviation of workloads in a deterministic environment. The experimental results for a set of benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of solution quality and running time.

                              In order to increase flexibility and reduce costs, several companies adopt mixed - model assembly lines whose output products are variations of the same basic model with specific and distinctive attributes. Unfortunately, such attributes typically lead to variations in the task process times. In the case of un-paced buffered assembly lines, these variations are smoothed by buffers with consequences in terms of work-in-progress, costs, space utilisation and lower productivity control. To face such weaknesses, some companies adopt paced un-buffered assembly lines where the cycle time is controlled by the continuous/synchronous moving of the products from the first to the last assembly station. In such contexts, the possibility of assembling different models with different assembly times can be managed through the use of supplementary flexible workforce. This article introduces an innovative balancing and sequencing hierarchical approach for paced mixed - model assembly lines using supplementary flexible workforce called ‘jolly operators’. The goals are to minimise the number of jolly operators and to limit the occurrence of work-overloads, which typically result in out-of-the-line assembly completion. The proposed approach is preliminary validated and applied to a case study from an Italian company assembling industrial air-dryers.

                              In a typical data collection process for the purpose of characterizing contaminated sites, boreholes are usually drilled in different locations based on a sampling plan; and consequently, multiple samples are collected from each borehole. As a result, it is quite plausible that a certain degree of dependency or similarity exists among observations nested within a borehole. However, when classical regression models are employed, such dependencies are often ignored, resulting in biased estimates. In site characterization studies, further complication arises due to the presence of left-censored observations, those falling below the detection limit of measuring instruments. To overcome the above issues, this paper employs a mixed effects model that allows accounting for the within-borehole data dependency while accommodating left-censored concentrations. The benefits of the adopted methodology are explored by analyzing concentration data obtained from characterization study of a brownfield site located in Montreal, Canada. This paper illustrates that the estimated within-borehole correlation can be used to determine the optimal number of boreholes as well as the sample size to be collected from each borehole. Such correlation is underestimated when censored values are not accommodated in the model but substituted with a constant prior to data analysis. In addition, the adopted methodology provides an accurate insight into the vertical extent of contamination that can result in different compliance decisions when compared with classical approach.

                              In the classical Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) the contact conditions are enforced by what is referred to as open-close iteration. The open-close iteration involves repeatedly fixing and removing the artificial springs between blocks in contact and thus falls into the category of trial-and-error solution procedures that cannot guarantee the solution is always convergent. Meanwhile, improper stiffness parameters of the artificial springs might cause numerical problems. In order to avoid the introduction of the artificial parameters and to avoid the open-close iteration, this study reformulates DDA as a mixed linear complementarity problem (MLCP). Then, the Fisher-Burmeister Line Search Algorithm (FBLSA) is modified to solve MLCP. Some typical examples including those originally designed by the DDA inventor are reanalyzed, proving the procedure is feasible.

                              Sediment of different size are transported in rivers under the action of flow. The first and still most popular sediment continuity model able to deal with mixed sediment is the so-called active layer model proposed by Hirano (1971, 1972). In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional hydromorphodynamic model given by the Saint-Venant equations for free-surface flow coupled with the active layer model . We perform a mathematical analysis of this model , extending the previous analysis by Ribberink (1987), including full unsteadiness and grainsize selectivity of the transported load by explicitly considering multiple sediment fractions. The presence of multiple fractions gives rise to distinct waves traveling in the downstream direction, for which we provide an analytical approximation of propagation velocity under any Froude regime. We finally investigate the role of different waves in advecting morphodynamic changes through the domain. To this aim, we implement an analytical linearized solver to analyze the propagation of small-amplitude perturbations of the bed elevation and grainsize distribution of the active layer as described by the system of governing equations. We find that initial gradients in the grainsize distribution of the active layer are able to trigger significant bed variations, which propagate in the downstream direction at faster pace than the "bed" wave arising from the unisize-sediment Saint-Venant-Exner model . We also verify that multiple "sorting" waves carry multiple associated bed perturbations, traveling at different speeds. Abstract Copyright (2014), . American Geophysical Union.

                              When a mixed - model assembly line (MAL) is balanced, it is generally assumed that the variants of a task over different models should be assigned to an identical station. In this study, this restriction is relaxed and the variants of a task over different models can be duplicated on two adjacent stations (referred to as adjacent task duplication) to improve the MAL’s efficiency. The adjacent task duplication incurs few additional training and tool duplication costs as each task is duplicated on at most two stations. Moreover, for each task, the assembly part storage is not duplicated as it can be shared by the two adjacent stations. The mathematical model of this problem is formulated and some important properties are characterised. A branch, bound and remember algorithm is then developed to solve the problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on 900 representative instances, of which 889 instances are optimally solved. The experimental results show that the use of the adjacent task duplication policy effectively reduces the number of stations, especially when the WEST ratios are small.
