                     The University bestows the designation "Graduate Faculty" upon faculty following review
                        of their credentials and recommendation by their colleagues. The University maintains
                        six levels of graduate faculty: (1) Full, (2) Associate, (3) Adjunct, (4) Adjunct
                        Research Co-Mentor, (5) Affiliate, and (6) Adjunct Teaching.
                     
                     
                     Only Full graduate faculty members may chair doctoral committees. Adjunct Research
                        Co-Mentor members may serve as co-chair of a master's or doctoral committee. Full
                        or Associate graduate faculty may chair master's committees. Only one adjunct or affiliate
                        graduate faculty member may serve as a voting member on any master's or doctoral committee.
                     
                     
                     Teaching adjunct members may not serve on graduate committees.
