                     UofM-MSO Partnership Will Make Campus Premier Destination For Music Training, Performance
                           and Artistic Outreach The University of Memphis and the Memphis Symphony Orchestra will announce a unique
                        partnership at a press conference on Thursday, May 5, at 10 a.m. in the University
                        Center Fountain View Suite.
                     
                     
                     In a groundbreaking collaboration between a university and a professional symphony
                        orchestra, the Memphis Symphony Orchestra (MSO) will partner with the UofM to create
                        the premier destination in the Mid-South for music training and performance, music
                        outreach and arts-centered, cross-sector community development. "This unprecedented
                        partnership will bring wonderful opportunities for both our students and our faculty
                        in the UofM Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music. I believe the collaboration will become
                        a model for future relationships between professional symphonies and universities
                        across the country. The University of Memphis is fortunate and honored to be partnered
                        with the Memphis Symphony Orchestra. It's great for the city, great for the symphony
                        and great for the University of Memphis," said UofM President M. David Rudd.
                     
                     
                     The Memphis Symphony Orchestra in Residence at the University of Memphis will offer a series of world-class symphonic music on campus, while retaining a presence
                        at The Cannon Center. These top quality performances at the UofM will create a rich
                        opportunity for students, faculty, patrons and all citizens of the Mid-South to experience
                        the full range of musical offerings created by the partnership. "This is a game-changer
                        for the MSO," said Gayle S. Rose, Chairman of the Board. "We bring a wealth of professional
                        musicians from across the globe, a 62-year history of artistic excellence and an industry-leading
                        community engagement program to the table to join forces with the UofM Rudi E. Scheidt
                        School of Music and a dynamic student-centered environment, allowing both of us to
                        innovate in ways we could not separately."
                     
                     
                     Brett Egan, President of DeVos Institute of Arts Management and consultant to the
                        MSO, noted, "The partnership is central to a comprehensive MSO strategy for a sustainable
                        future. MSO is back on track and, through the partnership, ideally positioned to add
                        value across Memphis' public and private sectors." The MSO's body of professional
                        musicians will complement the world-class faculty at the UofM School of Music, creating
                        a one-stop shop for aspiring musicians in the Mid-South. In addition, the MSO's global
                        music network will attract leading ensembles and soloists to campus. Guest conductors
                        and soloists will provide master classes for UofM students each year. "I am happy
                        for the serendipity of timing, that I get to take the artistic helm with so much good
                        news abounding. New artistic leadership, new educational and civic partnerships –
                        an incredible new chapter ahead for all of us," stated Robert Moody, MSO's incoming
                        Principal Conductor.
                     
                     
                     The collaboration also will position Memphis as a hub for arts-centered social innovation.
                        The Institute for the Arts, Social Enterprise and Entrepreneurism will engage the
                        MSO, UofM faculty and students, and community partners in developing arts-centered
                        solutions for two sectors: business and government. The Institute will provide practical,
                        problem-solving services in Memphis and catalog the city's efforts to utilize arts
                        and culture as a catalyst for social change. "The magnitude of potential in classical
                        music and the arts as a whole surrounding this partnership has all the MSO family
                        swirling in possibility," said Jen Bradner, interim CEO of the MSO.
                     
                     
                     "The UofM-MSO partnership re-establishes the close ties that helped sustain each organization
                        in its formative years," said John Chiego, Director of the Rudi E. Scheidt School
                        of Music. "It promises to allow both to attain new heights of national and international
                        prominence. This is a great collaboration for our students, our program and for all
                        music in Memphis."
