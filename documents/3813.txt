						Profile of a Recent Graduate

Among our favorite stories are those of local Memphians who become successful and are able to give back to their communities.  One such story is that of Terrence Brittenum.  He graduated as Valedictorian from Trezevant High School in 1995 and knew that he had to go to college.  He says, “I was told by my mother and other family friends that education would provide me access to a better life.”  Determined to achieve a better life, Brittenum participated in the University of Memphis’s Adventures in Teaching Institute which offered collaboration and field experiences, which seemed second nature since, as he recalls, “At the age of 4, I would teach younger family members and other kids in the neighborhood. I always knew I would be a teacher.”
As an undergraduate, Brittenum served as the President of the Golden Key National Honor Society at the University of Memphis, learning valuable lessons regarding the importance of hard work, community service, resiliency, perseverance, and demonstrating courageous character and integrity in the face of adversity.  Upon graduating from the University of Memphis with a B.S. in Education, he began his teaching career, eventually becoming a school administrator.  He is currently serving as the principal of A. Maceo Walker Middle School.
Recently, Brittenum returned to the University of Memphis. The University’s now-retired First Generation PhD Fellowship program offered support during his rigorous program of study.  Brittenum says, “It is extremely difficult to work on a doctoral degree and work full time, but I am able to use my research in my everyday work.” He cites Provost Karen Weddle-West and Dr. Bonnie Cummings with fueling his passion for teaching, and one of his favorite memories at the University includes working as a graduate assistant in the College of Education under the leadership of former Dean Nathan Essex. Brittenum remembers that, “Dr. Essex always encouraged me to be my best and to push past adversity.”
Along with Terrence’s family and friends, the University is proud of Terrence and the many students like him.  He graduated with a 4.0 G.P.A. on Saturday, August 8, 2015, with his Doctorate of Education degree in Leadership & Policy Studies.  He is the first person in his family to complete a doctoral degree.
