                        and historic occupations of the region, a nature trail, a fully certified arboretum,
                        and a fascinating array of plant species used for medicinal, dye and other ancient

                     The C.H. Nash Museum was founded in 1956 following the 1930s rediscovery of a Mississippian
                        (AD 1000 - 1500) mound complex by workers preparing for the Jim Crow era Shelby County
                        Negro Park (now the T.O. Fuller State Park). The earthen mounds (still standing today)
                        are believed to have been constructed and occupied between 1000-1500 AD by the people
                        of the Mississippian culture who used platform mounds for ceremonies and residences
                        of high-ranking officials within their culture. The site is now used as a laboratory
                        for training archaeologists and as a place for the public to come and learn more about
                        the remarkable science of archaeology.
