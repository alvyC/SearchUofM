About the Consortium

The Consortium of College Testing Centers (CCTC) is a referral service provided by the National College Testing Association (NCTA) to facilitate distance learning. The purpose of the CCTC is to make test administration services available to students away from their campuses, particularly at educational institutions. It is a free service for students or others who are seeking a professional location at which to take an exam. All participating test centers must be NCTA members in good standing and are expected to adhere to the CCTC guidelines . In addition the testing center must subscribe to and indicate compliance with the NCTA Professional Standards and Guidelines . Listings are only available to operational testing centers and not to individuals or other groups who wish to serve as proctors.
