                     March 24, 2015 - Alena Allen, associate professor in the University of Memphis' Cecil
                        C. Humphreys School of Law, has been selected to participate in the 2015 Tennessee Board of Regents' Maxine Smith
                        Fellows Program. TBR is the governing body for 46 universities, community colleges
                        and technology centers throughout the state.
                     
                     
                     The Maxine Smith Fellows program provides diverse employees of TBR schools the opportunity
                        to participate in a working and learning environment that will enhance their career
                        experience and development. It is intended to provide an introduction to administrative
                        roles in system or upper-level administrative policy-making positions.
                     
                     
                     Each Fellow is assigned an administrative mentor at the TBR central office, the Tennessee
                        Higher Education Commission or one of the TBR schools. The Fellow works with a mentor
                        to develop a Fellowship work plan. Allen's mentor will be Dr. Tristan Denley, TBR
                        vice chancellor for Academic Affairs.
                     
                     
                     "I am grateful for the opportunity and consider it a great honor to be chosen to represent
                        the University of Memphis as a Maxine Smith Fellow," said Allen. "Dr. Maxine Smith
                        was a central figure in the history of Memphis' civil rights struggle, particularly
                        with respect to education. The fellowship is opportunity to continue the progress
                        towards realizing her dreams."
                     
                     
                     Allen earned her juris doctorate from the Yale Law School. Her teaching interests
                        are in the areas of torts and health law policy. She was elected Professor of the
                        Year in 2013. Allen's current research agenda includes issues related to legislative
                        attempts to improve care for women with breast cancer.
