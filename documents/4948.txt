                        Dr. Gire is an Assistant Professor of Physics who conducts research in the area of
                           Physics Education. Specifically, she is interested in students' fluency with external
                           representations when learning physics and solving physics problems, and in the professional
                           development of physics majors, including their epistemological and metacognitive development.
                           She uses research-based pedagogical strategies in her courses, encouraging students
                           to be actively engaged with the course content.
                        
                        
                        She is the undergraduate advisor for the physics department, the advisor for the department's
                           Society of Physics Students and Sigma Pi Sigma chapters, and is on the faculty advisory
                           board for the University of Memphis TigersTeach program.
