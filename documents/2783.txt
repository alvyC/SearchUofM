                     The West Tennessee STEM Hub is a project funded by a Tennessee Race to the Top grant
                        which impacts 36 Local Educational Agency partnerships in 21 counties, including urban,
                        suburban, and rural districts with nearly 17,000 teachers and approximately 240,000
                        students. The diverse geographic and demographic settings offer the ability to assess
                        the effectiveness of different STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) teaching
                        and learning strategies for the West TN region.  Principal Investigator:  Dr. Stephanie
