                     ARIES (Acquiring Research Investigative and Evaluative Skills) is a learning environment
                        with conversational agents that hold trialogs with the human learner who is acquiring
                        critical reasoning skills on science. The learner holds conversations with two animated
                        pedagogical agents while solving a number of engaging problems in the social and physical
                        sciences. ARIES is embedded in a game environment with an electronic textbook, multiple
                        choice questions, and the trialogs. Science teachers in both high school and higher
                        institutions could assign ARIES as homework, if they decide not to devote class time
                        to it.
