                                 For Adobe Connect : Prior to the first umMeet session, you will need to complete the computer test . This test will check a computer for its compatibility with Adobe Connect. It is
                                    highly recommended to complete the test a few days in advance in the event that there is a problem.
                                    If a problem is detected, troubleshooting tips are available on the computer test website.

                           Give yourself plenty of time to connect. If you're in a hurry and trying to connect
                              for the first time, you may run into trouble.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           If you're not speaking during the session, it may be helpful to turn your microphone
                              off to prevent background noise and feedback.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           Video and phone connections are options. Be sure to understand what features your
                              instructor expects you to use. For example, if video is required, and your computer
                              doesn't have a camera, you will need to use another device.
