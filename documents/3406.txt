                     International students on F-1 visas must be enrolled at least full-time (12 credit
                     hours-Undergraduate/Law, or 9 credit hours-graduate) for the fall and spring semesters.
                     The exceptions to less than full-time enrollment for international student on F-1
                     visas are: (1) if it is your last semester of enrollment, or you are working on your
                     phase of dissertation or thesis, then you must be enrolled at least part-time; (2)
                     if it is due to special circumstances (i.e., medical), then you will have to provide
                     in writing to the Student Employment Office the reason(s) and it must be approved
                     by the Financial Aid Director; (3) if it is during the Summer term and school breaks
                     between semesters (winter breaks, spring breaks), no enrollment is required. Concurrent
                     enrollment at this university and a community college, college, and another university
                     is not acceptable for enrollment requirements for employment eligibility at this university.
                     
                     Do I need a social security number in order to work?
                     International students on F-1 visas must obtain and use valid federal social security
                     number in order to be eligible for employment on-campus. To obtain a valid federal
                     social security number, you must go to the Social Security Administration Office located
                     at 1451 Union Avenue. You must bring with you your I-20 and passport to show them,
                     and on letterhead, proof of employment on-campus. Once you obtain a  valid federal
                     social security number, go the the Registrar's Office in Wilder Tower, Room 003, and
                     request that your social security number be entered in Banner under your student profile.
                     You will need to show them your social security card. Notify student employment once
                     this is done.
                     
                     How many hours a week can I work?
                     According to INS, if you are an international student on F-1 visa and enrolled at
                     least full-time, you may engage in part-time on-campus employment, but not to exceed
                     20 hours per week, which includes all pay sources. However, you may be employed on-campus
                     full-time not to exceed 40 hours a week, which includes all pay sources, during school
                     breaks (winter breaks, spring breaks, and summer term), your last semester before
                     graduating, or during your thesis or dissertation phase of study, or you have special
                     permission for full-time employment as part of a coop or internship program. The student
                     employment office will need a copy of this special permission for your employment
                     file. If you have questions regarding employment visa restrictions, contact your International
