                        staff be worried about this?
                     
                     
                     A:   Complete access to records ensures that auditors are able to carry out their job
                        responsibilities. Rest assured that internal auditors are held to very high standards
                        with regard to confidentiality and safeguarding information. The department adheres
                        to the Institute of Internal Auditors Code of Ethics, which includes the following
                        statement: "Internal auditors respect the value and ownership of information they
                        receive and do not disclose information without appropriate authority unless there
                        is a legal or professional obligation to do so."

                     Q: I'm familiar with the state auditors - is internal audit the same thing?
                     
                     A:   No. The state auditors are employed by the State of Tennessee. Each year they arrive
                        on campus and perform a required external audit of the University's financial statements.
                        The UOM Internal auditors are employed by the University of Memphis and report to
                        the UOM President and also to the TBR Audit Committee.

                     Q: Who receives reports from internal audit?
                     
                     A:   Reports are issued to the University President who forwards the report to the Tennessee
                        Board of Regents. Others receive copies based on their relationship to the activity
                        or department audited - usually the division vice president, the activity/department
                        director, and others on a "need to know" basis, depending on the circumstances

                     Q: Why didn't I receive my W-2 in the mail?
                     
                     A:   If it is past the first week or two of February, then the most likely reason is the
                        W-2 was mailed to wrong address. W-2s are processed each January, based on the mailing
                        address you entered in Employee Self Service, now accessible through the "myMemphis"
                        portal.
                     
                     
                     To get your original W-2 you may:
                     
                     Contact Internal Audit to see if it was returned to the University, and Bring your ID and stop by in person to pick it up, or Tell us your new address and we will mail it to you. Alternatively, you may log-in to the Employee area of the "myMemphis" portal and print
                        a copy of your W-2 yourself. If we do not have your original W-2, you may also obtain
                        a copy from the Payroll Office in 272 Administration, 901.678.3841.
                     
                     
                     You may also elect to receive an electronic copy instead of a paper copy of your W2
                        each year by logging-in to the "myMemphis" portal and making a one-time election in the Employee
                        tab. For more information contact the Payroll Office at 901.678.3841 or payroll@memphis.edu .

                     Q: How can I make sure the University has my correct address?
                     
                     A:   Internal Audit cannot change your address. To do this you must:

                        your address, or Visit the office of Employee Records (178 Administration Bldg.) and complete a change
                        of address form.
