	   TRACES Award
Call for Nominations: 2016 Traces Award
Deadline: November 1
Download A Nomination Form

Each year UMAR presents the Traces Award to a University retiree chosen by the three most recent winners for exemplifying the concept of remaining active in scholarly and/or civic pursuits into retirement. The award metaphorically refers to “remaining in the traces,” a concept dating to farm days. 
For more information, contact a.mizell@memphis.edu or 901.678.3119.

On behalf of the entire Alumni Association and UMAR, we would like to congratulate the TRACES Award winner for 2015, Sheryl Maxwell. 

Community News 
Children's books were donated by UMAR’s Book Club to the Family Resource Center at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which houses a library so children and their families can check out books during their extended stay at the facility.  If you missed the opportunity to give, you may still do so by contacting Ms. Barbara Joyner at 901.595.4639 to schedule a time to drop-off the books or to retrieve an address to mail them to. 
Parking Pass Update:
Parking Services is extending the expiration on all Section 5 parking tags through the end of the year. Those with expired hangtags in this area will not be ticketed. If you have moved within the past year, Parking Services has requested an updated mailing address. Please send any updated addresses to alumniassociation@memphis.edu .
