                     A New Destination for the Arts
                     
                     There is an overall feeling that the new Music Center at the University of Memphis
                        will be much more than a venue. It will be a destination where the arts will be heard,
                        seen and felt. Fans of every musical genre, from all over the region, will come together
                        for the enjoyment of music. The Center will allow much larger productions to come
                        to our campus. The Center will allow us to continue to build upon our relationships
                        with other arts programs in the City to host their performances on our campus, reflecting
                        the University's commitment to a vibrant performing arts scene in Memphis.

                     Artists and Audiences ARE Forever Changed By Your Support
                     
                     
                     Due to the age and design of the current music building, the Rudi E. Scheidt School
                        of Music productions and community programs are limited in scope. We will finally
                        be able to address issues such as lack of stage space, seating and acoustically appropriate
                        spaces. A new Music Center at the University of Memphis will give our aspiring students
                        what they deserve. Since we are the only doctoral degree-granting program in music
                        in Tennessee, this facility will help us celebrate the innovative spirit of our students
                        and continue to attract high-caliber talent to our University.
                     
                     
                     Now is the Time
                     
                     Enthusiasm continues to grow for this important project. This is a rare opportunity
                        like never before. Over 200 friends, faculty and staff of the Rudi E. Scheidt School
                        of Music have already contributed towards our goal. We are sincerely grateful to our
                        supporters and are confident that their investments will carry on the legacy of the
                        Scheidt School of Music to continue to attract world-class students and faculty for
                        years to come. The new Music Center has legacy opportunities for you, your family
                        or to honor a loved one. We will help you find the perfect way to be a part of the
                        future of music at the University of Memphis. For questions about how to be a part of our continued success please contact Katherine
