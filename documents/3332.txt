                     Each year the First Scholars Program accepts 20 students to participate in this special
                        cohort. Scholars selected to the program will receive an annual $5,000 scholarship
                        over their four year experience at the University of Memphis, for a total of $20,000
                        in scholarship funding. In addition to the scholarship, students will receive a number
                        of social, academic and leadership activities designed to guide scholars through key
                        transitions pivotal to their success.
                     
                     
                     The First Scholars staff works with each Scholar as they move through our Steps To
                        Success™. This framework focuses on an annual theme and targeted learning objectives
                        that guide First Scholars through the key transitions pivotal to their college success.

                        year of the First Scholars Program:
