                     Who can have a UUID? How do I get my UUID?
                     
                     All currently enrolled students and currently employed staff and faculty automatically
                        have a Universal User ID or UUID created. Anyone who needs assistance should contact
                        the Service Desk at 901-678-8888 or e-mail umtech@memphis.edu .

                     A student's UUID is created as soon as the student is admitted to the university.
                        Information outlining the steps to initialize the UUID is mailed along with the acceptance
                        letter. This letter contains a twenty-character account activation code used with
                        the university Identity Management system : https://iam.memphis.edu .
                     
                     
                     Faculty and returning adjunct faculty
                     
                     UUIDs are created for every tenure-track faculty member and many adjunct faculty members
                        when their contracts are approved. Faculty members should receive information about
                        initializing their accounts in the mail along their contracts.
                     
                     
                     Staff and new adjunct faculty
                     
                     New staff and new adjunct faculty should contact the ITS Service Desk to check the
                        status of their UUIDs if they have not received one from their supervisor or LSP.
                        While staff and adjunct faculty have UUIDs created automatically when their records
                        are created in the HR system, we strongly recommend contacting the Service Desk to
                        check its status. New staff should check with the Service Desk on their first day
                        at work. New Adjunct faculty should check after receiving a copy of their signed contract.
                        The Service Desk can be contacted at 901-678-8888 or by e-mailing umtech@memphis.edu .
