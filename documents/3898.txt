                        Want to sharpen or share your writing skills? The University of Memphis Center for Writing and Communication is currently planning
                           a series of workshops during the Spring 2017 semester.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     As valuable as lecture and peer-critique can be, we hope to strengthen your actual
                        writing skills through writing itself.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     For that reason, the workshops will center around hands-on practice. In a weekly or
                        bi-weekly series (TBA), professional academic writers will offer their insight and
                        guided practice in various academic writing skills and concepts. We will work on editing,
                        document design, and rhetorical analysis of instructor-provided examples as well as
                        your own writing—so don’t forget to bring it with you! The workshops will be open
                        to all members of our university community—undergraduates, graduate students, faculty,
                        and staff. Whether you are struggling with writing essays of any kind, preparing materials
                        for publication, or designing an attractive job document portfolio, we want you to
                        take part.
                     
                     
                     Please send an email to cwc@memphis.edu to express your interest. We definitely encourage suggestions; we will be finalizing
                        the schedule over winter break, so please get in touch!
