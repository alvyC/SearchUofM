                     UofM Researcher Receives $3.2 Million Grant To Study Early Prevention of Lung Disease
                     
                     September 12, 2016 - Dr. Wilfried Karmaus, professor in the Division of Epidemiology,
                        Biostatistics and Environmental Health at the University of Memphis School of Public
                        Health, has been awarded a R01 grant of $3.2 million by the National Heart, Lung and
                        Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health.
                     
                     
                     The funded study will aim to improve early prevention of asthma and chronic obstructive
                        pulmonary disease (COPD), which is essential to reducing the burden of these high-impact
                        diseases.
                     
                     
                     Intra-uterine conditions are critical for development during childhood, adolescence
                        and adulthood. Researchers will study whether metabolites, nutrients and toxins in
                        maternal serum during pregnancy are associated with methylation at specific sites
                        in the genomic DNA in blood cells collected after delivery. Then they will test whether
                        the methylation of these genomic sites is associated with lung growth between the
                        ages of 10 and 18, and a decline at 26.
                     
                     
                     "In the future, this will allow us improve intra-uterine conditions to prevent lung
                        diseases," said Karmaus.
                     
                     
                     Karmaus, Hongmei Zhang and Su Chen of the University of Memphis will collaborate with
                        Michigan State University, the Ilse of Wight Asthma and Allergy Centre and the Universities
                        of Southampton and Bristol in the United Kingdom, and the Hokkaido University in Japan.
