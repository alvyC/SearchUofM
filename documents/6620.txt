                        closely with Dr. Jerry Wolff researching mate choice and sexual behavior of prairie
                        voles. Her research focuses on the evolution of learning, memory and decision making
                        and how this interacts with patterns of change in the environment. After earning her
                        Masters degree from Northern Arizona University where her research focused on social
                        learning, spatial memory for food caches and aspects of social foraging she completed
                        her Ph.D at the University of Minnesota. Her work there was a combination of mathematical
                        modeling, operant learning experiments with blue jays and experimental evolution studies
                        with fruit flies. She is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow at The University of Arizona where she is working with bumblebees and modeling to answer questions about the value
                        and use of information. Dr. Dunlap has recently presented at the Animal Behavior Society meeting in Pirenopolis,
                        Brazil and has published several papers, including others currently in review. Summer

                        several projects, all of which considered the ecology of aquatic animals.Â  Continuing
                        his post-graduate education at The University of Michigan he studied the chemical
                        ecology in crayfish and was awarded a Masters of Science and Doctorate of Philosophy.

                        byÂ  crayfish native to the Great Lakes region and crayfish that were introduced to
                        that region by humans. Of particular interest were the impacts of introduced crayfish
                        on native species.Â  After completing a two-year faculty position at Rhodes College,Â Dr.
                        PecorÂ is now an Assistant Professor of Biology at The College of New Jersey, where

                        the ecology of introduced crayfish, and crayfish natural history.Â
