                     Dr. Carson is best known for his connections with students and his never-ending concern
                        for their representation and well-being on campus – he never forgets a student he
                        meets. He is a constant source of support for hundreds, thousands, of current and
                        past students. He has been a strong advocate in paving the way for a significant minority
                        student population on campus.
