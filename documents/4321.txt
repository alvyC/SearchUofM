                     History of the Collection
                     
                     In 1975 a collection of forty-four (44) ancient Egyptian objects was obtained for
                        the University of Memphis (then Memphis State University) from the Museum of Fine
                        Arts in Boston through the generosity of Mr. E.H. Little, a prominent Memphis businessman.
                        Since that time, and mostly through the generosity of private donors, the collection
                        has grown steadily to its present size of over 1,400 objects. The collection spans
                        the entire range of ancient Egyptian history and prehistory (ca. 100,000 B.C.E. through
                        700 C.E.). There are mummies, religious and funerary items, jewelry, sculpture, and
                        objects from everyday life.
                     
                     
                     From its inception, the collection has served as an important teaching resource for
                        students and faculty at the University of Memphis and throughout the Mid-South region.
                        Students in such diverse disciplines as art, anthropology, history, classics, art
                        history and education make use of the collection during their coursework. As part
                        of the  Master's Program in Egyptology  at the University of Memphis, students may choose an item from the collection as
                        the subject of their Master's thesis. In addition, scholars from all over the world
                        contact the IEAA regarding objects in the collection.
