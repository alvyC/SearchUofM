                     "The online program provides me the flexibility to write my own study plan and, at
                        the same time, builds the self-discipline necessary to execute the plan. As such,
                        I feel much more responsible for learning course material in an online setting."

                        looking at learning from the online students' perspective. The results have been a
                        pleasant surprise in that engaged students do a great job in class, they report getting
                        to know their classmates at least as well as they did in the traditional classroom,
                        and I feel that same student-teacher connection that I've enjoyed in the classroom.
                        As an added benefit, I've noticed that my in-class teaching has improved as a result
                        of the online course development and delivery.
                     
                     
                     Instructors teaching online courses tend to be those leading-edge teachers that really
                        value teaching and student learning. They spend a lot of time considering the best
                        ways to make your online learning experience as engaging and effective as possible.
                        We online instructors also talk to each other to learn those 'best practices' that
                        help to make our online courses as effective as possible. You can't beat the convenience
                        factor, and given the numerous technologies available today, you will most likely
                        find that your teacher is as available as any in a traditional classroom...a real
                        win-win for everybody!"

                     "The experienced faculty and personable staff made me feel like an on-campus student
                     even though I never had to visit the campus to complete my degree. The convenience
                     of the online program is priceless and I recommend this program to anyone interested
                     in receiving a world-class education in a distance education format."

                     "Taking online classes at the UofM has been a great experience. I usually like to
                     have a professor to listen to and ask questions but learning has been just as efficient.
                     Being able to adjust your classes to your personal schedule is a great benefit."
