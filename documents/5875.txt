women A special Panel on "Women in Cybersecurity: Why there are so few and what we can do about it"

Moderator: Ambareen Siraj (Tennessee Tech University).
Panelists: Ronda Henning (Harris Corporation), Yuan Xue (Vanderbilt University), Suzanne Miller (VACO).

As 2011 (ISC)2 Global Information Security Workforce Study reports, security professionals worldwide are expected to increase to nearly 4.2 million by 2015. Despite the growing demand in the job market, cybersecurity remains an area where there is significant shortage of skilled professionals not meeting the need of today’s increasingly technological society, both nationally and regionally. Even worse, women’s representation in this field is alarmingly low. According to studies and reports, women are significantly underrepresented in the male-dominated field of security. Identified barriers include unconscious bias, attitudes of men towards women colleagues/subordinates/supervisors, lack of women to act as mentors, and discriminatory practices with salaries and promotion in the field of computing in general. In addition, specifically for cybersecurity, lack of training, education, guidance, and support also work as significant barriers.
The panel, consisting of representatives from academia, government and industry will discuss, with active participation of audience, why diversity in cybersecurity workforce matters, why women are underrepresented in this field and the concerns and issues that need to be addressed to increase participation of women in cybersecurity.
