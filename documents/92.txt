                        If you want to see innovation happening, cities are the best place to start. A combination
                           of infrastructure challenges, varying socio-economic groups, and a range of technology
                           needs-based solutions makes emerging technology an essential component of a city's
                           success. Join Memphis CIO Brent Nair for a talk on what is happening at the cutting
                           edge in Memphis.
