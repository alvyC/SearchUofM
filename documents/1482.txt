                     African Diaspora Arts and Visual Culture is an interdisciplinary area of concentration
                        within the B.A. in Art History. Its mission is to introduce students to the theoretical
                        frameworks and methodologies for approaching the study of the diverse arts and visual
                        cultures of peoples of African descent.Â  Art and visual culture are examined in relation
                        to the broader African diaspora, whereby students acquire analytical skills that enhance
                        their understanding of historical and contemporary issues from a global perspective.
                        Students supplement the Art History curriculum with courses drawn from a variety of
                        disciplines.Â  The program objectives for the concentration in African Diaspora Arts
                        and Visual Culture emphasize research employing original sources, the ability to think
                        and read critically, the skill of writing meaningfully, and the application of acquired
                        knowledge in the context of cultural institutions such as museums, galleries, and
                        historical sites.

                        4381, 4386, 4660, or 4662. In addition to 9 hours ARTH 4000-level series, students

                     The study of Ancient Egyptian art is by its very nature interdisciplinary, combing
                        elements of visual analysis and art historical methods with textual evidence and archaeological
                        and epigraphic fieldwork. This concentration will introduce students, at the undergraduate
                        level, to various aspects of ancient Egyptian culture, focusing primarily on its art
                        and its language and literature. The Egyptian objects currently in the collection
                        of the Institute of Egyptian Art & Archaeology, both on display and in storage, provide
                        an invaluable asset to this program and will greatly enhance the studentsâ learning
                        experience.
