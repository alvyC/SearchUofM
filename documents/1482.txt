                                  1.) African Diaspora Arts and Visual Culture
                     
                     African Diaspora Arts and Visual Culture is an interdisciplinary area of concentration
                        within the B.A. in Art History. Its mission is to introduce students to the theoretical
                        frameworks and methodologies for approaching the study of the diverse arts and visual
                        cultures of peoples of African descent.  Art and visual culture are examined in relation
                        to the broader African diaspora, whereby students acquire analytical skills that enhance
                        their understanding of historical and contemporary issues from a global perspective.
                        Students supplement the Art History curriculum with courses drawn from a variety of
                        disciplines.  The program objectives for the concentration in African Diaspora Arts
                        and Visual Culture emphasize research employing original sources, the ability to think
                        and read critically, the skill of writing meaningfully, and the application of acquired
                        knowledge in the context of cultural institutions such as museums, galleries, and
                        historical sites.
                     
                     
                     Within the requirements for the major in Art History, students in this concentration
                        need to complete: ARTH 2020, 2030, 4184, 4185, 4186, 4187; and two courses from ARTH
                        4381, 4386, 4660, or 4662. In addition to 9 hours ARTH 4000-level series, students
                        need to take two courses outside of the Department of Art selected from the following: 
                        ANTH 4120; ENGL 3325, 3326, 4373; HIST 4051, 4222, 4288, 4879; SOCI 4420, 4904, 4905.
                     
                     
                                  2.) Ancient Egyptian Art and Culture
                     
                     The study of Ancient Egyptian art is by its very nature interdisciplinary, combing
                        elements of visual analysis and art historical methods with textual evidence and archaeological
                        and epigraphic fieldwork. This concentration will introduce students, at the undergraduate
                        level, to various aspects of ancient Egyptian culture, focusing primarily on its art
                        and its language and literature. The Egyptian objects currently in the collection
                        of the Institute of Egyptian Art & Archaeology, both on display and in storage, provide
                        an invaluable asset to this program and will greatly enhance the students’ learning
                        experience.

                     *Note:  Two semesters of hieroglyphs (arranged as ARTH 4197) must be taken during

                     The European tradition is an area of concentration within the B.A. in Art History,
                        whose mission is to introduce students to the visual cultures of the Western world,
                        from antiquity to the modern (and postmodern) age.  The concentration offers coursework
                        covering the diverse visual traditions and the variety of historical periods associated
                        with Europe and the Americas. The concentration emphasizes that its students acquire
                        the ability to read, write and understand the major concepts of art history and to
                        conduct original research in the discipline.
