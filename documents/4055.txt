                     Academic Misconduct
                     
                     Graduate students at the University of Memphis are expected to observe the regulations
                        and policies that govern the behavior of students as members of this academic community.
                        These regulations and policies are published in the Student Handbook. In particular,
                        graduate students should become familiar with the University's policies on plagiarism
                        in its various forms. Furthermore, term papers may not be used to meet the requirements
                        of more than one course unless approved in advance by both instructors.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis Code of Student Conduct defines academic misconduct as all
                        acts of cheating, plagiarism, forgery, and falsification.
                     
                     
                     The term "cheating" includes, but is not limited to:
                     
                     
                        
                        Using any unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes or tests
                        
                        Using sources beyond those authorized by the instructor in writing papers, preparing
                           reports, solving problems, or carrying out other assignments
                        
                        
                        Acquiring tests or other academic material before such material is revealed or distributed
