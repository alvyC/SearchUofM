                     A municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) is a publicly-owned conveyance or system
                        of conveyances (i.e., ditches, curbs, catch basins, underground pipes, etc.) that
                        is designed or used for collecting or conveying storm water and that discharges to
                        surface waters of the State. To name a few examples, a MS4 can be operated by municipalities,
                        counties, drainage districts, colleges, military bases, or prisons.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis operates a Phase II MS4. The MS4 is governed by the State
                        of Tennessee National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. This
                        permit is required by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation as
                        mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act of 1972.
                     
                     
                     Our goals as an MS4 are to:
                     
                     
                        
                        Reduce any discharge of pollutants that could be transported through our MS4s and
                           carried untreated to pollute our local bodies of water.
                        
                        
                        Protect water quality
                        
                        Satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of the Clean Water Act.
                        
                     
                     
                     In order to achieve these goals the University of Memphis is required to satisfy six
                        minimum control measures as outlined below.
