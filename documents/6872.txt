                     This study extends our current knowledge in the area of online consumer behavior by
                     examining how a business's sales channel strategy could influence consumer's sales
                     channel preferences. It makes a new argument that business strategies could play an
                     important role in consumer sales channel preference development. When a business offers
                     multiple sales channels (a hybrid model), its customers can compare sales channels
                     either within or outside of the same corporate business. Such freedom is, however,
                     diminished when a business employs the Internet as the only transaction medium (pure
                     Internet store). A matrix was developed to demonstrate how business strategies could
                     interplay in the consumer preference formation process and later was used to segment
                     our respondents into three different groups. They were segmented according to the
                     sales channel strategies of their selected Internet store and the brick-and-mortar
                     store that they used to make a comparison. MANOVA and structural equation modeling
                     tests were performed on 435 survey respondents. Four preferential factors, including
                     transaction cost, product, risk, and social experience, were used as examples and
                     tested across three groups of respondents. Results revealed that online users employ
                     different sets of preferential factors when comparing different sets of sales channels.
                     Such results were thereafter used to draw a new set of online strategies that could
                     be used to allocate business resources more effectively.
