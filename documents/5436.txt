                     Professor Jesse W. Spiceland Endowed Graduate Scholarship
                     
                     In 2010, family members of Professor Emeritus Jesse W. Spiceland made a generous gift
                        to create the Professor Jesse W. Spiceland Endowed Graduate Scholarship for the School
                        of Accountancy. The endowed fund is awarded to a first year graduate student enrolled
                        at the University of Memphis in the School of Accountancy masters program. The scholarship
                        is in honor of Professor Jesse Spiceland who taught at the University for over 40
                        years. During his tenure at the UofM he taught every accounting course in the curriculum
                        as well as several courses in other departments in the College. Also, he served as
                        Department Chair and served on virtually every committee in the college and university
                        at one time or another.
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     Professor Jesse Spiceland has passed down his passion for the University of Memphis
                        to his family. Professor David Spiceland, the son of Professor Jesse Spiceland, has
                        taught in the School of Accountancy at the UofM for the past 29 years. Professor David
                        Spiceland's wife, Charlene Spiceland (M.Ed 86' & M.S. 00') also is an Instructor in
                        the School of Accountancy at the UofM. Carol Warren (BBA 75'), a daughter of Professor
                        Jesse Spiceland, is the University Bursar. The Fogelman College and the University
                        of Memphis would like to thank the Spiceland family for their generous gift.
