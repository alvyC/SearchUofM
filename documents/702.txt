                     Mission and Committee Information
                     
                     The mission of the Department of Academic Affairs is to provide coordination and academic
                        support for the colleges and schools at The University of Memphis. We also provide
                        support to the Provost in the administration of the University's academic programs,
                        administer the broad academic services and programs, and serve as the coordinating
                        arm for instructional units. The department develops and maintains information for
                        decision making, conducts evaluations and assessments, and provides resources for
                        academic improvement. The Department of Academic Affairs also provides efficient and
                        courteous service to prospective and current students in support of their educational
                        goals. We are dedicated to providing the support needed to navigate the day-to-day
                        operations. Student success is our business, and we are committed to offering services
                        that enhance opportunities for our student body.
                     
                     
                     The success of Academic Affairs can directly be attributed to the commitment and dedication
                        of its employees. In an effort to recognize this, an awards program has been formed
                        to recognize the hard work and dedication of our employees and also encourages them
                        to participate in the process. An Awards Committee has been established to create
                        specific awards, develop guidelines, and make recommendations for why, how, and when
                        the awards will be presented. The Awards Committee is comprised of members representing
                        several areas of Academic Affairs. Committee members will serve for a two-year period,
                        which will begin June 1 each year. Committee members for the 2015-2016 academic year
                        are as follows:
                     
                     
                     Kate Howard, Chair, Recruitment & Orientation Services Martha Harrell, ITS Desktop and Smart Tech Support Mary Rhodes, Provost Office Bridget VanLandeghem, Athletic Academic Services Yolanda Mathews, Enrollment Services
                     
                     
                     The Academic Affairs Awards Program has been designed to recognize those individuals
                        who have made significant contributions to the success of the division and to convey
                        our appreciation for their loyalty, commitment, and contributions to the University.
                        The awards will be presented biannually at a Divisional Awards Ceremony.
