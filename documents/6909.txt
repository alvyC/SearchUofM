                     Ever since MYCIN introduced the idea of computer-based explanations to the artificial
                     intelligence community, it has come to be taken for granted that all knowledge-based
                     systems (KBS) need to provide explanations. While this widely-held belief has led
                     to much research on the generation and implementation of various kinds of explanations,
                     there has been no theoretical basis to justify the use of explanations by KBS users.
                     This paper discusses the role of KBS explanations to provide an understanding of both
                     the specific factors that influence explanation use and the consequences of such use.
                     The first part of the paper proposes a model based on cognitive learning theories
                     to identify the reasons for the provision of KBS explanations from the perspective
                     of facilitating user learning. Using the feedforward and feedback operators of cognitive
                     learning the paper develops strategies for providing KBS explanations and classifies
                     the various types of explanations found in current KBS applications. This second part
                     of the paper presents a two-part framework to investigate empirically the use of KBS
                     explanations. The first part of the framework focuses on the potential factors that
                     influence the explanation seeking behavior of KBS users, including user expertise,
                     the types of explanations provided and the level of user agreement with the KBS. The
                     second part of the framework explores the potential effects of the use of KBS explanations
                     and specifically considers four distinct categories of potential effects: explanation
                     use behavior, learning, perceptions, and judgmental decision making.
