                     1L CSO ORIENTATION
                     
                     All 1Ls are required to attend a 1L CSO Orientation in January. During Orientation,
                        students will be introduced to the services we provide; find out basic information
                        such as who we are, where we are located, and how to schedule an appointment; be provided
                        with access to Symplicity; and hear a short presentation on 1L summer jobs.
                     
                     
                     In addition, students will receive a 1L Guide at Orientation. This guide, along with
                        the Orientation PowerPoint, can be accessed through the document library located in
                        Symplicity .
                     
                     
                     January One-on-One Appointments
                     
                     Along with being required to attend Orientation, all 1Ls are also required to schedule
                        a mandatory one-on-one appointment with Career Services in January. The purpose of
                        the meeting is to help 1Ls create a strategy in planning and preparing for their careers.
                     
                     
                     Before the January meeting, we will send a short questionnaire to have students complete
                        and bring with them to the meeting. In addition, students will need to draft a legal
                        resume prior to the January meeting. We will provide tips on ways to strengthen your
                        resume during the one-on-one.
