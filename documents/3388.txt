                     How do I register for classes?

                        a schedule of courses for your first semester. After being advised, you will register
                        for the courses you and your advisor have selected. You will have a copy of your class
                        schedule when you leave Orientation.
                     
                     
                     Will I have my student ID made at Orientation?

                     Do I have to attend the entire program?
                     
                     You must attend all of the scheduled activities. Make plans to participate in the
                        entire session and arrange your work schedule and travel plans accordingly.
