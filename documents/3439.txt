                     On-Campus Interviews
                     
                     Career Services welcomes employers to UofM to conduct on-campus interviews to identify
                        UofM talent for job and internship opportunities. Interviews are typically held in
                        Career Services but some may be held in the University Center.
                     
                     
                     Employers have three interview options for on-campus interviews.
                     
                     OPEN –Employers set the interview date and determine interviewing preferences. Students
                        select an interview time on a first come, first serve basis. If you match the preferences
                        and times are still available, you may select an interview time and submit your TigerLink
                        default resume.
                     
                     
                     PRE-SELECT - Resume submission deadlines are set based on the employers' interview
                        dates. Students submit resumes and employers select individuals to interview. Selected
                        individuals will be contacted via e-mail to schedule their interview time through
                        TigerLink.
                     
                     
                     ROOM RESERVATION ONLY – Some employers advertise positions and set their own on-campus
                        interview schedule. Employers will contact you directly.
                     
                     
                     No Show/Late Cancellation Policy
                     
                     No Calls/No Shows damage UoM's relationships with employers and can negatively impact
                        student's recruiting opportunities.
                     
                     
                     Choosing an interview time is your decision. Accepting interviews with organizations
                        you are not interested in and/or failing to attend scheduled interviews deprives others
                        of opportunities, wastes recruiter and staff time, and makes you and UofM appear unprofessional.
                     
                     
                     If you must cancel an interview, you must provide at least 24-48 hours notice. Failing
                        to appear for a scheduled interview or canceling your interview without 24 hours notice
                        will affect your interviewing and TigerLink access.
                     
                     
                     Students and Alumni that do not show for a scheduled interview or cancel a scheduled
                              interview within 24 hours risk having their TigerLink access suspended.
                     
                     To reinstate access privileges, students must meet with the Director of Career Services
                        and send a letter of apology to the employer within five days. Reactivating privileges
                        will be at the discretion of the Director.
