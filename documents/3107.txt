                                       everyone.  She immediately became an integral part of the team and provides a unique
                                       perspective, amazing insight and an incredible work ethic.  Her desire to learn is
                                       invigorating and having someone new who is interested in our mission and work has
                                       challenged us to re-evaluate our processes and expand our influence."

                                    Students from the University of Memphis are among our best interns, and we have hired
                                    many of them into full-time positions."
