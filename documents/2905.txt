                        State University. WSMS-FM 91.7, carrying the Memphis State call letters, was created
                        as an all-jazz station. Although the call letters changed to WUMR, when Memphis State
                        became the University of Memphis on July 1, 1994, the station, which is now known
                        as WUMR "The Jazz Lover" U 92-FM, has stayed true to the all-jazz format during its
                        30-year history. WUMR is part of the College of Communication and Fine Arts' (CCFA)
                        Department of Communication. An element of the station's mission is to train communication
                        and journalism students in broadcasting.
                     
                     
                     "When I founded the station, we chose the all-jazz format for three reasons," says
                        Richard Ranta, CCFA Dean. "We didn't want to compete with the programming of commercial
                        radio in Memphis, and none of the stations were playing jazz regularly. We wanted
                        a musical style that appealed to a multiracial audience and, finally, jazz was a format
                        that fit in nicely with the jazz curriculum in our music department, now the Rudi
                        E. Scheidt School of Music," Ranta continues.
                     
                     
                     Although WUMR relies on volunteers and students for on-air shifts, and to manage some
                        of the daily tasks, the station's recipe for success is its focus on professionalism.
                        This professionalism was brought to the station when the late Bob McDowell was hired
                        as WUMR's general manager in 1982. McDowell was a great influence in every aspect
                        of the broadcast industry, not only in Memphis and the surrounding area, but also
                        nationally. He was the backbone of WUMR, founded and was executive director of the
                        Memphis Area Radio Stations Association, was program director for WDIA as well as
                        program director, station and general manager for WRVR before he took the position
                        at the University of Memphis.
                     
                     
                     Today, the station provides the best in classic and contemporary jazz to local listeners,
                        24-hours a day, and, a tribute to 21st century technology, the station now also streams
                        online so that jazz lovers from all over the world can tune in. WUMR will continue
                        to be a major learning laboratory for students, giving many of them the very first
                        opportunity to work at an FM station—on air and behind the scenes. It still supports
                        the jazz program at the University of Memphis as well as local jazz musicians, and
                        Mid-South jazz lovers. Malvin Massey, long-time WUMR music director and former jazz
                        musician, is the station's general manager.
