	   I joined the Alumni Association, but I have not received my membership card yet. How
long does it usually take?

    It usually takes about 5-7 business days to receive your membership packet.
    If you need a membership card before that time, you can stop by the Alumni Center,
    located at 635 Normal Street, during business hours (Monday-Friday, 8:00 am-4:30 pm)
    to pick up a temporary membership card.
    
    If you have not received it after 7 days, please contact our membership analyst at
    901-678-2586 to check on the status and confirm that the address we have on file is
    correct.
    

I just renewed my Alumni Association membership and followed the instructions above,
but I do not see the option to enable Email365.


    Please note: Once you join the Alumni Association, it can take two or more business
    days for your membership to process in the system. You will not be able to activate
    your email account until that time.
    

FAM Members: I joined online, how do I get my t-shirt?

    You will need to pick up your t-shirt at the Alumni Center, located at 635 Normal
    Street during normal business hours (Monday-Friday, 8:00 am-4:30 pm). Print out your
    confirmation page to show the person at the front desk.
    
    You can also get a temporary membership card at this time if you have not received
    your permanent membership card.
    

 
For additional questions, please contact the Alumni Association at alumniassociation@memphis.edu or 901.678.2586.
