	   ​The University of Memphis Alumni Association invites you to be a part of future traditions
at the UofM. Adding a visual and lasting symbol of our alumni and students at the
foot of the Administration Building through a 10 foot “M” medallion is a way to can
give back to the University. The school’s name has changed and people have come and
gone, but the “M” of Memphis has always remained.
Two of the Association’s goals are to beautify our campus and to pass on traditions.
“Tigers Around Town” was our first project to enhance the campus and the community.
The “M” is another such example. It is our hope that students will organically form
a tradition around the “M.” For example, if two students hold hands in the center
of the M at 19:12 (7:12 pm), they will be destined to be married, or perhaps it will
be bad luck to walk on the “M.”

A committee will continue to work on the details to determine if the final design
will be in granite, bronze, etc. The required concrete work has been donated.

We appreciate your gift to future students through your donation to the Legacy M Campaign!
Your gift will be recognized on our website, and all donors will be invited to an
unveiling ceremony. We invite you to leave your legacy and make a gift in your name,
or make a gift in honor of a friend and keep the legacy going!
