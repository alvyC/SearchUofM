      Fiscal
    Issues in Community and Economic Development
    A Student-Authored E-Text
     
    Preface
    This e-text was written by
    the students of Financing Community
    Development , a course in the Graduate Program in City & Regional
    Planning at the University of Memphis. When I set out to teach this class
    for the first time in the spring of 2006, I wanted to introduce students to
    the relationship between planning and a community’s fiscal health,
    emphasizing the causes of fiscal stress in local government and the actions
    that planners take in response. This approach relied on concepts from a
    variety of different disciplines, and I found that a convenient class text
    containing only relevant information did not exist. The student-authored
    e-text project was intended to serve two purposes: [1]
    1.       
    To develop a concise resource
    that will be informative to planning students and practitioners interested in
    fiscal issues in community and economic development, 
    2.       
    To allow students to pursue
    specialized knowledge in relevant subject areas beyond what might be
    covered in regular class discussion and readings.
     
    Part I of the text tackles a
    set of hot-button topics in community and economic development that are
    currently generating debate in metropolitan areas across the country:
    Wal-Mart, the “Creative Class,” and professional sports subsidies. Laura
    Jewell sorts out the various impacts of Wal-Mart to decipher whether
    big-box retail is a benefit or a burden at the local level. Tim Moreland
    takes a closer look at the latest chamber of commerce buzz-word, placing
    the creative class hype in the context of supply-side versus demand-side
    approaches to regional economic development. Patrick Napier examines why
    cities have been willing to spend so much public money on professional
    sports facilities. 
     
    Part II examines policies and
    tools available to address the fiscal challenges currently facing American
    metropolitan areas. Emily Hunter describes a regional approach to
    problem-solving, examining the concept of tax-base sharing. Whitney Choat
    explores a local-level solution, covering the pros and cons of tax
    increment financing. Finally, Donald Anthony provides a grass-roots
    perspective in his discussion of community development corporations.
     
    I hope that this edition of Fiscal Issues in Community and Economic
    Development will be the first of many to
    come.

Professor Norman Krumholz at Cleveland State
University that I came across while preparing my syllabus for Financing Community Development . (I try
to teach my students to always give credit where it is due.)
