                        Laboratory located in the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders at the University
                        of Memphis. The lab uses a multifaceted approach to study the neural encoding of complex
                        sound (e.g., speech and music) at both pre-attentive and cognitive levels of brain
                        processing. Methods include a coordinated blend of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs),
                        psychoacoustics, and computational modeling. Current lab projects are focused on understanding
                        the neurocomputations involved in generating basic psychoacoustic phenomena and during
                        complex music/speech listening. A special focus of the lab is to better understanding
                        the connection between neuroelectric brain activity elicited by auditory events and
                        human behavior. Complementary work examines how different listening experiences and/or
                        training (e.g., music lessons, bilingualism) influence an individual's auditory skills
                        and how these benefits might transfer to improve seemingly unrelated cognitive abilities.
                        We are particularly interested in how musical training improves speech- and language-related
                        skills.
                     
                     
                     ELENA DELaVeGA, SOCIAL WORK
                     
                     Dr. Delavega's research interest is Poverty, and the intersection of oppression, marginalization,
                        and exclusion; the role of education, disabilities, and ontologies. Her foci are sustainable
                        economic development, poverty remediation, wages, the relationship between education
                        and capital, capital transformations, and immigration.
                     
                     
                     She is fully bilingual in English and Spanish. She loves history, art, political science,
                        sociology, literature, philosophy, physics, and I enjoy museums and volunteer whenever
                        time permits, and is deeply troubled by the suffering caused by poverty.
                     
                     
                     Her goal is to contribute to the understanding and elimination of structural forms
                        of poverty and exclusion through a global focus that is locally grounded and engaged.
                        Because of a profound belief that all oppression is ultimately economic oppression
                        leading to the exclusion from sharing in social goods, her framework is based on Critical
                        Theory and French Poststructuralism, and is related to policy analysis, especially
                        on services for culturally diverse populations.
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     Donal Harris, English
                     
                     Donal Harris specializes in American literature from the Civil War until the present. His research
                        and teaching focus on the relationship between American literature and the many social
                        institutions that have taken part in producing, circulating, and judging it. His current
                        book project, entitled On Company Time: American Modernism and the Big Magazines,
                        identifies both the formal and economic affiliations between American modernists and
                        mass-market magazines, and reads modernist literary practice within, rather than against,
                        an emerging mass print culture.
                     
                     
                     His work has appeared in PMLA, Criticism: A Journal, and the collection Failing Gods
                        and Angels: 20th Century African American Writers and the Left.
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     Jennifer Mandel, Biology
                     
                     Dr. Mandel joined the department in 2014. She received a B.A. from Carson Newman University
                        with a focus in organismal biology, ecology, and natural history. Her Ph.D work involved
                        plant conservation and evolutionary genetics both in rare, endangered species as well
                        as weedy, invasives. Following this, her post-doctoral research at The University
                        of Georgia was aimed at identifying the genetic basis of evolutionary and agronomically
                        important traits in cultivated sunflower. Her research at the UofM includes plant
                        population and quantitative genetics, evolutionary genetics, and phylogenetics. She
                        employs field, laboratory, and greenhouse approaches to gain an understanding of the
                        processes and mechanisms that lead to the genetic, phenotypic, and ecological diversity
                        we see in the world. Courses taught include Ecological Genetics 7795/8705 and Plant
                        Ecology 4053/6053.
