                     GWU Professor Will Lecture on the Decline of Late Bronze Age Empires
                     
                     October 27, 2015 - Dr. Eric Cline will examine the swift demise of complex Late Bronze
                        Age empires in the Mediterranean region around the year 1177 BC in the Sesquicentennial
                        Lecture at the University of Memphis. Cline will discuss "1177 BC: The Year Civilization
                        Collapsed" Thursday, Nov. 5, in the University Center Theatre. A reception will begin
                        at 5:30 p.m., followed by the lecture at 6 p.m. The event is free and open to the
                        public.
                     
                     
                     For more than 300 years, from about 1500 BC to 1200 BC Egyptians, Mycenaeans, Minoans,
                        Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Cypriots and Canaanites all interacted and created
                        a cosmopolitan and globalized world-system. Yet around 1177 BC, these large empires
                        and small kingdoms that had taken centuries to evolve began to rapidly collapse. With
                        their end came the world's first recorded Dark Ages. It was not until centuries later
                        that a new cultural renaissance emerged in Greece and the other affected areas, setting
                        the stage for the evolution of Western society as we know it today.
                     
                     
                     Blame for these events is usually laid squarely at the feet of the so-called Sea Peoples,
                        known from the records of Egyptian pharaohs. However, as was the case with the fall
                        of the Roman Empire, the end of the Bronze Age empires in this region was not the
                        result of a single invasion, but of multiple causes. The Sea Peoples may well have
                        been responsible for some of the destruction, but it is much more likely that a combination
                        of events, both human and natural – including earthquakes, storms, droughts, famine,
                        rebellions and systems collapse – coalesced to cause such a cataclysmic turn of events.
                        The similarities and parallels that can be drawn with the world today make this more
                        than simply a study in ancient history.
