                     Child Development and Family Studies
                     
                     The Bachelor of Professional Studies in Child Development and Family Studies focuses
                        on recognizing and enhancing important developmental milestones for children from
                        birth through adolescence.Â  Students will learn how to create effective learning environments
                        to promote childrenâs healthy development as well as assist parents in creating positive
                        relationships and environments for the development of their children.Â  In addition,
                        students study the stages of development from infancy through adolescence and the
                        ways that family, culture, peers, and schools influence the growth of children. Students
                        will also explore the importance of advocacy for children and their families whether
                        it be in the classroom, hospital, or justice system.
                     
                     
                     The B.P.S. in Child Development and Family Studies courses are designed to reflect
                        professional standards set forth by the National Association for the Education of
                        Young Children (NAEYC). These standards are critical indicators of program quality.
                     
                     
                     In addition to core courses based on early childhood development, these guidelines
                        contain course work designed to develop skills and knowledge of the historical, social,
                        cultural, and educational contexts of the field.
                     
                     
                     This program DOES NOT lead to teacher licensure. Students interested in gaining a
                           teaching license should contact the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences
                           at 678-2728.
