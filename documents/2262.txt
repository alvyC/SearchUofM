                     Applying to the Graduate Program in City & Regional Planning is easy!

                     First, interested individuals should complete the University's standard online Graduate School application . You can find a step-by-step description of the Graduate School application process,

                        Program in City & Regional Planning.) Your completed Graduate School application will
                        be forwarded to the Graduate Program in City & Regional Planning for review.
