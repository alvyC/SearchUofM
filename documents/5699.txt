                     April 21, 2015 - Two departments in the University of Memphis College of Communication
                        and Fine Arts have named distinguished members to their faculty – Tom Shadyac, successful
                        Hollywood director, and Kevin Sharp, director of Dixon Gallery and Gardens.
                     
                     
                     Shadyac is the new filmmaker in residence in the Department of Communication, and
                        Sharp has been appointed joint faculty member by the Department of Art.
                     
                     
                     Shadyac's resume includes films starring Jim Carrey, Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy
                        in the hit movies Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Patch Adams and The Nutty Professor . Shadyac has been teaching at the U of M since 2013, donating his services, time
                        and resources.
                     
                     
                     "The filmmaker in residence title is a small act we can make to recognize the remarkable
                        effort and philanthropic resources that he has provided and continues to offer," said
                        Leroy Dorsey, chair of the Department of Communication.
                     
                     
                     Shadyac's course, Storytelling and Life, is a popular one, often filling up within
                        minutes of the start of registration. Initially the class was set up for 25 students.
                        Since its inception, it has grown and this spring was moved to a 95-seat classroom
                        to accommodate student expansion.
                     
                     
                     The popularity of the class is attributed to his hands-on, real world sensibility
                        to the arts, which energizes his students and the faculty. He encourages the University's
                        mission of engaged scholarship by having his students participate in community service-related
                        projects for area schools.
                     
                     
                     Shadyac's appointment is a 10-year renewable one. In addition, he continues to teach
                        at Colorado University, flying to Memphis weekly for his one-night, special topics
                        course.
                     
                     
                     Sharp will hold a six-year appointment as joint faculty member, and will teach and
                        serve on thesis/dissertation committees. Hired in 2007, Sharp's administration has
                        led to many significant contributions to Dixon. The annual budget has increased more
                        than $1 million, more than 300 works of fine and decorative art have been added to
                        the permanent collection, and he led a successful $4.5 million campaign to endow a
                        Dixon directorship. In addition, he expanded the visibility of Dixon through collaborations
                        with museums such as the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Speed Art Museum
                        in Louisville, Petit Palais in Paris, France, and Saint Louis Art Museum.
                     
                     
                     Before joining Dixon, Sharp served as director of Visual Arts at Cedarhurst Center
                        for the Arts in Mt. Vernon, Ill., curator of American Art at Norton Museum of Art
                        in West Palm Beach, Fla., and research curator at the Art Institute of Chicago.
                     
                     
                     "We are very pleased to welcome Kevin Sharp to our faculty," said Richard A. Lou,
                        Department of Art chair. "Mr. Sharp has brought tremendous vision to the Dixon Gallery
                        and Gardens that has produced a wonderful vitality with the Dixon's direct engagement
                        with the contemporary arts community and the underserved populations in the region.
                        It has been inspiring to observe all of these transformations take place in the very
                        short time that he has been here."
