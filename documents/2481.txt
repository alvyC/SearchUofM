                     Focus Area on Global History
                     
                     Approaching historical study from a global perspective and conducting research that
                        crosses boundaries and disciplines promotes a synthetic understanding of the continuities
                        and transformations that have shaped the development of human societies and cultures.
                        Global history investigates the interactions and exchanges between human societies
                        and incorporates numerous approaches — empires and colonization, the emergence of
                        religions, philosophy, and science, migration and diaspora, slavery, peace and war,
                        economic and technological change, popular culture and media, and ecological and environmental
                        shifts — that can neither be captured nor comprehended within the national borders
                        that have traditionally defined advanced historical study. Global history also embraces
                        multiple temporalities, whether studying one particular moment or the entirety of
                        human history.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis’s global history program features a strong base of faculty
                        working in different eras and areas, from ancient Egypt to 21st-century Europe, and
                        representing diverse theoretical and methodological perspectives. Our department’s
                        particular strengths in global history include women, gender, and sexuality; military
                        and diplomatic history; migrations, diasporas, and slavery; economics and global trade;
                        the history of ideas, including the history of religion and the history of medicine;
                        environmental history; and the study of space and place.
                     
                     
                     Catherine Phipps specializes in the history of Japan and the development of its transnational
                        networks in the modern era. Her research and teaching interests include the Japanese
                        empire in Asia, port cities, regional economies, comparative imperialism, and historical
                        geography. As many environmental issues are inherently global, Yan Gao’s work on climate
                        change, geological transformation, disease transmission, natural resource management,
                        and the rise of ecological and environmental ideas explore human-nature interactions
                        within the larger processes of social and economic transformation, creating an ecological
                        niche in the field of global history. Dennis Laumann, a specialist in West African
                        history, teaches courses that examine African history within a global context and
                        writes on imperialism, colonialism, and Marxism. Robert Yelle’s research covers the
                        history of religion, with special emphasis on Hinduism, British Protestantism, and
                        theories of secularization. Beverly Tsacoyianis teaches Modern Middle Eastern History,
                        and fits her regional expertise into the global history focus area through her teaching
                        and research in migration, diaspora, and conflict as well as the cross-cultural transmission
                        of medical, scientific, technological, and religious practices. Andrei Znamenski’s
                        work focuses on Russia, the indigenous peoples of Siberia/Alaska and Mongolia, and
                        their religions; he offers a cross-cultural comparative perspective that integrates
                        the history and anthropology of Europe, indigenous Northern Asia, and indigenous North
                        America. Guiomar Dueñas-Vargas's work explores issues of colonization, state formation,
                        Latin America and the international division of labor, the Cold War, the slave trade
                        and black societies, eugenics, international migration, and transnational feminism
                        and women’s movements. Courtney Luckhardt's research and teaching focuses on medieval
                        cultural and religious history, particularly in Late Antiquity and the early Middle
                        Ages, looking at medieval travel, communication, and connectivity, Mediterranean Studies,
                        and cross-cultural exchange. Andrew Daily works in the areas of French history, the
                        Caribbean, and colonial, imperial, and postcolonial history, with a particular emphasis
                        on the shared cultural and intellectual history of Europe and its empires. Scott Marler
                        teaches the history of the Atlantic World, c. 1440-1888, with a strong emphasis on
                        slavery, as well as the global history of capitalism. Susan O’Donovan works in the
                        area of slavery and emancipation, fields of study that have long defied national as
                        well as disciplinary boundaries. Her current research reveals the transnational lives
                        of enslaved Americans and she offers courses that explore the transatlantic slave
                        trade, women in Atlantic slavery, and emancipation as a historical and global problem.
