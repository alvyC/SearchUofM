                     2015 CLEA AWARD
                     
                     University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law recent graduate Bill Hardegree
                        (JD 14) was recently awarded the Clinical Legal Education Association (CLEA) Outstanding
                        Student Award.
                     
                     
                     CLEA recognizes law students who have excelled in clinical fieldwork in law school
                        by providing high quality representation to clients, and who have engaged in exceptionally
                        thoughtful, self-reflective participation in an accompanying clinical seminar. The
                        award is based on excellence in case work and the quality and extent of the student's
                        contribution to the clinical community at his law school. Bill was lauded for, among
                        other things, his ability to set the pace and the standard for his colleagues in his
                        diligence, preparation, thoughtfulness, and motivation to be the best lawyer he can
                        be.
                     
                     
                     In his mid-semester reflection, Bill Hardegree listed his tenets of life as "passion,
                        diligence, and integrity. He said, "I am extremely passionate about my work. "...If
                        I submit a trial brief with my signature, I will make sure that it is truthful, aesthetically
                        appealing, and better than any sample brief. It may not be perfect, but my diligent
                        pursuit of the best fueled by my passion will make it a contender for perfection."
                     
                     
                     In her nomination letter for Mr. Hardegree, Professor Donna Harkness notes several
                        things about Bill that make him the ideal candidate for this award. She states that
                        in his daily work, Bill lived up to his previously noted tenets, making every effort
                        to take maximum benefit from the clinic and to hone his professionalism and litigation
                        skills. He handled four cases in which he represented eight children. He deliberately
                        chose his cases to give himself a wide range of experience: a highly contested, complex
                        severe child abuse case involving four children ages seven to one; a guardianship
                        for two Central American unaccompanied minors escaping from violence in their home
                        country; a delinquency for a youth facing transfer to adult court, and foster care
                        review for a dependent-delinquent youth in a residential treatment program. He accomplished
                        representation with knowledge, persuasion, and reflection, routinely logging twenty
                        to twenty-five hours per week. Bill not only plans ahead strategically, he seeks out
                        feedback on how he can improve at every juncture.
