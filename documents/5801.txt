                           with award winning choreographer Mark Godden to produce the ballet "Two Jubilees" which

                           Cooper's Saxophone Sonata from that release is highly regarded, belonging with "such
                           landmark 'jazz/classical' pieces as the Phil Woods Sonata, on any recital or concert
                           program that explores (both) these worlds."
