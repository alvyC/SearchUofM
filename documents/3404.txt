                     You must be enrolled at least half-time (6 credit hours-Undergraduate/Law, and 5 credit
                        hours-Graduate) to be eligible to work on-campus. Note: If you are an international student under an F-1 visa, you must be enrolled full-time (12 credit hours-Undergraduate/Law,
                        and 9 credit hours-Graduate) to be eligible to work on-campus during the academic
                        year. The only exception is if it's your last semester, or it's Summer session, or
                        you are doing your thesis or dissertation phase of study, then you may be enrolled
                        less than full-time.
                     
                     
                     You can work for more than one department as long as you don't work overÂ 25 hours
                        a week. It is up to the department to determine how many hours a week you can work.
                        However, you cannot work under Regular Student Employment and Federal Work-Study at
                        the same time.Â Also, it is up to you and the department to ensure that your work schedule
                        does not interfere with your class schedule. Note: If you are an international student
                        under an F-1 visa, you can only work 20 hours a week during the academic year. The
                        exception to this rule is: (1) it's during school breaks (i.e. Fall break, Spring
                        break, and Summer session), you are allowed to work up toÂ 25 hours a week, or (2)
                        you have special permission for full-time employment in your last semester as part
                        of a coop or internship program. The Student Employment Office will need a copy of
                        this special permission for your file.
                     
                     
                     After reading over the job lists, if you see a department you are interested in, please
                              contact that department for an interview. You may take the copy of the job list with
                              you. The hiring department will provide an employment application, if needed.
                     
                     NOTE: Some departments list student employment openings on their own web sites.
