                     1. A copy of the Certificate Of Release Or Discharge From Active Duty, (DD-214 Member-4)
                        or other armed forces separation papers
                     
                     
                     2. Copy of Delayed Enlistment Contract
                     
                     3. Copy of marriage license and children's birth certificates
                     
                     4. Copy of final divorce decree if either veteran or spouse was previously married
                     
                     5. VA File Number
                     
                     6. Notice of Basic Eligibility (NOBE)
                     
                     7. Kicker Contract
                     
                     Enrollment Status : For VA educational benefits during the regular full 15 week semesters (Fall and
                        Spring), 12 semester hours constitute a full-time load for undergraduate and law students.
                        For graduate students, 9 semester hours constitute full time. Training time for summer
                        sessions and other non-standard terms for undergraduate, law, and graduate students
                        is determined by the number of semester hours enrolled in each part of term.
                     
                     
                     The Veterans Administration places restrictions on those who receive VA educational
                        benefits. Some restrictions include: (1) regular class attendance, (2) satisfactory
                        academic progress, and (3) adherence to a specific degree plan.
                     
                     
                     Degree Plan : Only courses required for the degree and major may be certified to the VA. Undergraduate
                        students now have access to UMdegree, a web-based tool that helps students and advisors
                        monitor progress toward meeting degree requirements. Courses that are listed as Fallthrough
                        on UMdegree may not be certified for VA Educational Benefits without further investigation.
                        Fallthrough generally indicates excessive elective course(s) that are not included
                        in the 120 hours needed to graduate. Students who enroll in courses that are listed
                        as Fallthrough on UMdegree should consult with their academic advisor and request
                        that UMdegree be updated if the course(s) is not correctly listed. This verification
                        is necessary before the course(s) may be included in the number of hours certified
                        to the VA.
                     
                     
                     Repeat Courses : VA will not pay for repeat courses if the grade previously earned is accepted by
                        the University of Memphis and will fulfill graduation requirements (even if the course
                        was taken at another institution with or without use of the G.I. Bill).
                     
                     
                     Although advisors are provided for veterans, this assistance does not relieve students
                        of the responsibility for fulfilling all VA and University requirements.
                     
                     
                     Certification : To request certification for VA educational benefits, students must submit the Veterans
                        Request for Certification form to Veterans Educational Benefits & Certification. Certifications
                        are not automatically processed, students must submit this form each semester.
                     
                     
                     VA Educational Tuition Deferment Request: Service members, veterans, and dependents of veterans, who are eligible for and receiving
                        VA educational benefits, may request to have their tuition and fees deferred until
                        the end of the semester by contacting Veterans Educational Benefits & Certification.
                     
                     
                     Early Registration for Veterans: Public Chapter No. 788, 2012 Acts of the Tennessee General Assembly. This new state
                        law provides that military veterans who entered and served honorably in the United
                        States armed forces on active duty, active national guard, or active reserves must
                        be allowed to register for classes at TBR and UT institutions prior to the general
                        student population. The law applies to a military veteran who is currently a resident
                        of Tennessee or whose home of record for military purposes is Tennessee, and who is
                        a student at a public institution of higher education.
                     
                     
                     Any veteran not currently receiving Veterans educational benefits who wishes to be
                        identified as a veteran in order to receive priority registration should provide a
                        copy of the DD-214 (or other appropriate military documents) to Veterans Educational
                        Benefits & Certification.
