                     Our accounting graduates have an opportunity to seek many different types of jobs.
                        The possibilities include international, regional and local CPA firms, international
                        corporations, large or small local companies, and federal, state, or local governmental
                        bodies. Some accounting graduates even decide to become entrepreneurs and start their
                        own companies. Accounting provides all those options.
                     
                     
                     Your starting salary depends on which of those choices you make, but our recent graduates
                        have had starting salaries ranging from a low of about $35,000 per year to $55,000
                        per year or more, with an average in the mid-to-high $40,000 range.
