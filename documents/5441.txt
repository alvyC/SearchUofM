        		Pursuant to Tennessee Code 49-7-104. Deferred payments by students receiving assistance.
        		
        			
        				The board of trustees of the University of Tennessee system and the board of regents of the state university, community college and area technology center system shall adopt procedures whereby a student attending an institution of higher education within their jurisdictions under educational assistance benefits administered/provided by the United States department of veterans affairs or under other governmentally funded educational assistance benefits may elect, upon formal application to the institution, to defer payment of the required tuition and fees until the student's monetary benefits from the department or other governmental agency have been received.
        				Such deferment shall not extend beyond the final day of the term for which such educational assistance benefits are being provided or until all monetary benefits are received from the department or other governmental agency, whichever occurs first; however, a further extension may be granted upon a finding of extenuating circumstances related to the delay of delivery of such benefits through no fault of the student.
        				The amount of tuition and fees deferred shall not exceed the total anticipated monetary benefits to be received by the student from the department or other governmental agency for the term.
        				Eligibility for such deferment shall terminate if the student fails to abide by any applicable rule or regulation or fails to act in good faith in the timely payment of required tuition and fees that have been deferred pursuant to this section.
        				No additional fees or service charges shall be imposed against a student by a state institution of higher education for deferred payments of tuition and fees made pursuant to this section.
        				All procedures adopted pursuant to this section are subject to the approval of the commisioner of finance and administration and shall be filed with the comptroller of the treasury.

VA only combines the total hours enrolled in each Part Of Term to determine training time when the Parts Of Terms overlap.
