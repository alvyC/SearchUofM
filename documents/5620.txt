                     UofM Will Transform Teacher Preparation Program With Gates Foundation Funds
                     
                     November 30, 2015 - The University of Memphis College of Education will transform
                        its teacher preparation program with funding from the University-School Partnerships
                        for the Renewal of Educator Preparation (U.S. PREP) consortium, a recipient of a Bill
                        & Melinda Gates Foundation grant.
                     
                     
                     The Gates Foundation will commit $34.7 million over three years to five newly-formed
                        Teacher Preparation Transformation Centers that will bring together higher education
                        institutions, teacher-preparation providers and K-12 school systems to share data,
                        knowledge and best practices. These cooperatives will develop effective teacher-preparation
                        practices to help ensure that more teacher-candidates graduate ready to improve student
                        outcomes in K-12 public schools.
                     
                     
                     The UofM is one of the partner universities in the U.S. PREP consortium headed by
                        Texas Tech University. The U.S. PREP coalition also includes Southern Methodist University,
                        the University of Houston, Southeastern Louisiana University and Jackson State University.
                     
                     
                     "The partnership enables the UoM to collaborate with universities implementing similar
                        changes," said Dr. Ernest Rakow, interim dean of the College of Education. "The U.S.
                        PREP coalition offers both a system of support and a space to learn from each other
                        as we all strive to enhance our pre-service teacher education programs and prepare
                        teachers who are culturally relevant, classroom ready and prepared to work in the
                        communities the University serves and beyond."
                     
                     
                     Dr. Heidi A. Ramirez, Shelby County Schools chief academic officer, said, "Shelby
                        County Schools is very excited by our expanding partnership with the University of
                        Memphis. This collaboration offers great promise as we continue working to ensure
                        every student has access to effective teachers and is prepared for college and career
                        success."
                     
                     
                     The Gates grant will transform the way the University of Memphis trains teachers,
                        building upon the success of the existing Ready2Teach initiative. The University and
                        its U.S. PREP partners will focus on common key drivers: building competency through
                        practice, a commitment to continuous improvement, effective teacher educators, and
                        robust partnerships with K-12 school systems and the communities they serve.
