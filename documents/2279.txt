                     Not a native of Memphis, Hornyak was like B.B. King, Elvis Presley, Sam Phillips and
                        thousands of other young dreamers who moved here as quickly as they could. Since arriving
                        for his freshman year at what was then Memphis State University, he has been a tireless
                        musical advocate.
                     
                     
                     He joined The Recording Academy in April 1994 as the first full-time executive director
                        of the Memphis Chapter and continues to serve in that position, working to provide
                        educational programs for the entire music community and expanding the region served
                        by the chapter to Louisiana and St. Louis.
                     
                     
                     One of his proudest accomplishments is directing the documentation of the region's
                        rich music heritage in more than 50 comprehensive filmed interviews with musical icons
                        for the GRAMMY Living Histories program, some of which were featured in the award-winning 2002
                        documentary, Sounds of Memphis, for which he served as executive producer. In 2013,
                        he organized "And The GRAMMY Goes To Memphis," a year-long exhibit at the renowned
                        Stax Museum of American Soul Music, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Memphis
                        Chapter.
                     
                     
                     His background includes working as a touring and studio musician; owning a sound and
                        lighting company; and serving as producer, engineer, studio owner, and artist manager.
                        His lifelong love of music still brings him to the stage as a founder of the nationally
                        touring Memphis Ukulele Band.
                     
                     
                     Since 1979, The Distinguished Achievement in the Creative and Performing Arts Award
                        has been awarded to honor outstanding Mid-South artists to celebrate the memory of
                        Elvis Presley.
