                     All applicants seeking admission to either the Master of Health Administration (MHA)
                        program must apply through either the on-line Healthcare Administration, Management
                        and Policy Centralized Application Service (HAMPCAS) system or the on-line Schools
                        of Public Health Application Service (SOPHAS) system. Some health administration or
                        management programs are in a school of business, medicine, or health sciences/professions
                        rather than in a school of public health; if you are applying to programs that are
                        in one of these schools, you may find it easier to apply through HAMPCAS.  If you
                        are primarily applying to programs that are in a school of public health, it may be
                        easier for you to apply through SOPHAS.
                     
                     
                     Before beginning an application, please read through HAMPCAS FAQs  and/or SOPHAS FAQs . 
                     
                     
                     Applicants must also apply for admission to the University of Memphis Graduate School;
                        this will be done through a link in the HAMPCAS or SOPHAS system.
