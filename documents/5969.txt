                        address at the meeting.  He discussed the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge ( MD2K ) that he directs, an NIH-funded project spanning 11 universities and Open mHealth
                        headquartered at the U of M. Since its inception in September 2014, MD2K has made
                        a tremendous impact on the research community, with 200+ published articles, $17M
                        of research funding through NIH and NSF, and 70+ scholars trained during the 2016
                        Summer Training Institute.
                     
                     
                     Since joining the Department in 2006, Prof. Kumar has been an extraordinarily successful
                        researcher. In addition to securing $20M+ of external grant funding, he has been recognized
                        at all levels for his work. His many accomplishments include an Early Career Research
                        Award (2008), selection to Popular Science magazine's "Brilliant Ten" (2010), a Faudree
                        Professorship (2011), Distinguished Research Awards (2012, 2013), and the first state-endowed
                        chair of excellence in computer science (2015). He is regarded as a national leader
                        in mobile health and is frequently invited to speak at international conferences,
                        universities, and federal agencies. He served as an advisor for President Obama's
                        Precision Medicine Initiative in 2015 and spoke at the White House on the future of
                        biosensors on 2013.

                     Prof. Wang's research focuses on improving the scalability, reliability, and security
                        of the Internet. She has received several major research grants from NSF as well as
                        smaller grants from the university. Her current major project is " Named Data Networking ( NDN )", a joint project with Colorado State, University of Arizona, UCLA, UCSD, UIUC,
                        University of Michigan, and Washington University that has received over $15 million
                        of NSF funding. She was recently awarded an NSF CRI grant with U. Arizona, UCLA, and
                        Washington University at St. Louis to support the evaluation, experimentation, and
                        further development of the NDN architecture.
                     
                     
                     She has published over 50 papers with more than 3600 citations and an h -index of 30. She received the 2010 Early Career Research Award from the College of
                        Arts and Sciences and the "PI Millionaire" recognition from the University of Memphis
                        in 2015.
                     
                     
                     
                     Prof. Vasile Rus was awarded a Dunavant Professorship from the U of M College of Arts and Sciences. His research interests lie at the intersection
                        of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational linguistics with an
                        emphasis on developing interactive intelligent systems based on strong theoretical
                        findings in order to solve big challenges such as automatically answering questions
                        from large collections of documents, furthering the effectiveness of educational technologies
                        such as intelligent tutoring systems, increasing the pace of discovery in biomedical
                        domains, developing interactive systems that optimize the effectiveness of substance
                        abuse treatments, or improving the quality of very large software projects.
                     
                     
                     Prof. Rus is currently involved in a large grant from Carnegie Learning on human and
                        automated tutoring systems, and earlier this summer he was awarded a $500K grant from
                        the Office of Naval Research to add career guidance components to a comprehensive
                        intelligent tutoring system called Personal Assistant for Life Long Learning (PAL3).
