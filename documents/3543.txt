                     JOINING MOOT COURT BOARD
                     
                     The outgoing Board selects from the twenty-five most qualified applicants in the second-year
                        class. Each candidate is required to sign a grade release form and submit a letter
                        of interest. Each candidate must have competed in at least two board-sponsored competitions
                        and be in good academic standing (GPA 2.00 or above). Participation in board competitions
                        involves being a trial or appellate advocate in an in-school or travel team competition.
                        Serving as a bailiff and/or witness in moot court or mock trial competition does not
                        satisfy moot court board eligibility requirements.
                     
                     
                     Selection
                     
                     Once candidates have submitted the grade release forms and letters of intent, their
                        index scores are calculated. An index score is calculated from the advocate's performance
                        in intraschool and participation on traveling teams. The score is based on oral and
                        appellate brief/trial notebook scores in competitive in-school competitions and round
                        advancement. Applicants who competed on traveling teams receive a five point addition
                        to the index score.
                     
                     
                     Once the index scores are calculated, the Board elects twenty members from the top
                        twenty-five index advocates. Each board member must be able to serve on the Moot Court
                        Board for one full year.
                     
                     
                     Membership
                     
                     The members of the Moot Court Board are required to perform a variety of responsibilities.
                        The Board members judge rounds of the Advanced and Freshman moot court competitions.
                        Board members may also help judge the traveling teams during practice.
                     
                     
                     Each board member who is not elected to an executive position serves on at least one
                        committee. The committees research and write the problems for the intraschool competitions,
                        grade briefs and trial notebooks submitted by competitors, and arrange for outside
                        judges for intraschool competitions.
