		“GHOST” Linux Vulnerability

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		ITS Security would like to alert the campus community of a recently announced Critical vulnerability that affects a number of Linux operating systems.  Dubbed the “GHOST” vulnerability, a flaw in the glibc library present in many Linux operating systems could allow a remote attacker to compromise an affected system through a buffer overflow against the gethostbyname() function.  Individuals responsible for Linux workstations or servers are strongly recommended to patch and reboot to protect against this vulnerability as soon as possible.  Please refer to your distribution’s support pages for further information and impacted releases, or departments may  contact their area’s LSP .
