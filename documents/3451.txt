                     I am honored to serve as the University of Memphis's first lady. Since coming to Memphis
                        in 2013, I've been inspired by the students and alumni, faculty and staff, donors
                        and community leaders who share a commitment to the success of our university, our
                        city and region.Â  Great things are happening at the University of Memphis. I'm grateful
                        to be able to contribute in a positive way to our progress.
                     
                     
                     Through my involvement with Women in Leadership and Philanthropy, I look forward to
                        creating stronger connections between the university and our alumnae and friends.Â 
                        The WLP gives women the opportunity to engage in the life of the university, to support
                        our students, and to give back in meaningful ways.
                     
                     
                     My deepest commitment is to early care and learning. Through the WLP and other partnerships
                        across campus and the city, I am confident we can improve child outcomes. Our community
                        is ripe for interventions that can make a difference in our children's future, which
                        will in turn make a difference in Memphis, across the state, and ultimately our nation.
                        By investing in children ages 0-3, we are preparing them for success in school that
                        will lead them to higher education.
