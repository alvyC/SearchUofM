The University of Memphis Alumni Association has partnered with Balfour for the creation
of an official ring for University of Memphis. The Memphis Ring is a timeless, tangible
symbol of the bond between all UofM graduates and the institution.
Before they’re distributed, each ring is taken to TOM III’s habitat and
“blessed” for good luck. Pouncer then presents each recipient with
his/her ring at the annual Memphis Ring Ceremony, held the weekend of
each December Commencement. Memphis Rings are only available to students
who have achieved 90 credit hours.
Order Memphis Rings and Graduation Announcements on Campus:
Wednesday-Thursday
October 26-27
10:00 am - 3:00 pm
University Center Lobby
Save the Date:
Memphis Ring Presentation Ceremony
Friday, December 9, 6:00 pm

Alumni will be able to order University of Memphis, Memphis State University or Memphis
State College rings in the same design. Men's and women's ring styles are available.
To order a Memphis State University ring, please call 1.866.BALFOUR.
