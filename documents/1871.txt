                     When AMUM opened in 1981, it went by the name University Gallery. At that time our
                        mission was to host temporary exhibitions. Over the years AMUM acquired the permanent

                        of Memphis; The University Gallery Board voted to commemorate this change with one
                        of it's own—a name change that reflects our transition to a collecting institution.
                     
                     
                     AMUM continues to host temporary exhibitions of contemporary art and culture alongside
                        selections from our permanent collections. Since 1994, the visiting artist series
                        has brought innovative contemporary projects to Memphis. Artists from the Mid-South,
                        New York, Chicago, Great Britain, Germany, The Czech Republic, and Russia have designed
                        site-based installations that include community and student participation. Egyptian
                        antiquities and African art are exhibited in galleries dedicated to these collections.
                     
                     
                     Our collections of Egyptian antiquities and African art are exhibited in dedicated
                        galleries and periodically updated with new themes. Students and scholars work with
                        art, objects and archival materials from our diverse collections researching individual
                        works and developing exhibitions. The 19th century to present-day print/drawing collection
                        includes several strengths: the work of Samuel H. Crone, Carroll Cloar's lithographs,
                        Épinal prints depicting Napoleon Bonaparte's life, Beth Van Hoesen's preparatory drawings
                        and prints, and Andy Warhol's polaroids, prints and silk screens.
