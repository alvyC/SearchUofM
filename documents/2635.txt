                     The Loewenberg College of Nursing received funding from Fedex Institute of Technology
                        to establish Center for Technologies and Research in Alzheimer's Care (CTRAC), a multidisciplinary
                        research center committed to research and development for innovative technologies
                        to improve the health and quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's Disease and
                        cognitive impairment. The center collaborates with researchers from other departments
                        including Electrical and Computer Engineering, Public Health, Communication Sciences
                        & Disorders, and Psychology. CTRAC also partners with community organizations and
                        industries for demonstration of feasibility of technology applications in real-life
                        settings. The research activities of CTRAC include: (a) development of the prototype
                        of an automated and adaptive software system that assists persons with AD in performing
                        computer activities and games, (b) demonstration of the feasibility of integrating
                        an innovative new flexible neuro-sensing micro device for continuous tracking of cognitive
                        neurological changes, and (c) examining effects of a therapeutic computer-assisted
                        stimulating activity program on neurocognitive improvement in persons with AD.

                     The University Of Memphis Lowenburg College Of Nursing partnered with Baptist Memorial
                        Hospitals in the metro Memphis area. The hospital utilized a high fidelity scenario
                        containing the same objectives as the one given to the senior nursing students prior
                        to graduation to assess nursing competency. Laerdal simulations scenarios were purchased
                        for university and hospital.
