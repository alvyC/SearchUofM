                     The Honors Student Council (HSC) is an organization of honors students that works
                        with the administration to develop and implement Honors Program activities. The HSC
                        brings major speakers to campus, communicates with other student organizations, and
                        promotes community among Honors students. Elections to the HSC are held in the spring
                        semester.
