                     We want to involve parents and families in the college experience, and we have designed
                        a program especially for you! This program will familiarize you with the University
                        of Memphis and everything we have to offer. You will have the opportunity to get your
                        questions answered and become acquainted with the campus so you can better appreciate
                        your favorite student’s college experience. The parent and family programs are held
                        on the same dates as the student programs but are facilitated in separate sessions.
                     
                     
                     The casual but informative program will give you the opportunity to:
