                     Growth in Business Process Reengineering (BPR) consulting services has led to a proliferation
                     of methods for conducting BPR. Sifting through vendor promotional hype and identifying
                     a set of techniques and tools that best meets a particular projectaes needs can be
                     a daunting task. This article investigates BPR Methods, Techniques, and Tools (MTTs)
                     and places them within an empirically derived reference framework. A comprehensive
                     picture of BPR emerges that includes MTTs that help in reengineering strategy, people,
                     management, structure, and technology dimensions of business processes. A BPR planning
                     approach for customizing this framework based on unique project characteristics is
                     then offered to assist in selecting those BPR project activities and techniques to
                     be emphasized. This flexible framework and comprehensive survey of commonly used BPR
                     techniques and tools forms a knowledge base to improve business process change practice
                     and provides a basis for future BPR research.
