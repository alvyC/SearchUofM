                        the University of Memphis since 1951. Active duty Air Force personnel, approved by
                        the University president, are detailed by the Department of the Air Force to administer
                        the instructional program. Air Force officers serve under appointment by the University
                        as Professor or Assistant Professor of Aerospace Studies.
