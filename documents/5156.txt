The Memphis Bulletin was founded in 1855 as a daily morning Whig Party newspaper.  As a conservative-leaning Whig newspaper it favored the Union cause during the Civil War and published throughout the war in Memphis.  After the war it was edited for a few months by former CSA Admiral Raphael Semmes and tilted towards the Conservative (Democratic) party positions.  The Bulletin ceased publication in 1868.
