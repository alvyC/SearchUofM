                     Refund by e-Refunds (Direct Deposit)
                     
                     Excess financial aid/scholarships for Spring 2017 will be direct deposited to your
                        bank account beginning January 13, 2017 (Law School - January 10, 2017) and daily
                        thereafter through the end of the semester for financial aid/scholarship awards that
                        are disbursed after the initial eRefund noted above.
                     
                     
                     It is important that you sign up for eRefund on TigerXpress by January 9, 2017 (Law
                        School - January 4, 2017).
                     
                     
                     If you receive financial aid/scholarship award amounts in excess of fees, you need
                        to sign up online on TigerXpress to have your refund deposited directly to your bank account. Note
                        that direct deposit authorization submitted to the Payroll Office is separate from
                        direct deposit authorization for financial aid/scholarship disbursement.
                     
                     
                     Refund by Check
                     
                     If you do NOT sign up for eRefund, check refunds will be mailed beginning January
                        20, 2017 (Law School - January 13, 2017), and every Friday thereafter through the
                        end of the semester for financial aid/scholarship awards that are disbursed after
                        the initial mailing noted above.

                     NOTE: For students who do not receive their refund checks in a timely manner, a stop payment
                        (initiated through the Bursar's Office) cannot be processed until 2 weeks from the
                        mail date of the check. The stop payment, re-issuance, and mailing of the replacement
                        check takes approximately 10 days. It is recommended that you sign up for direct deposit to avoid this possible 3-4 week
                           delay.
                     
                     eRefunds are the fastest way to receive your excess financial aid/scholarship funds!
                     
                     Financial Aid Disbursement Information for Students with Outstanding Debt
                     
                     
                        
                        Federal regulations require authorization from the student to use Title IV funds (i.e.
                           federal financial aid) to pay prior term charges and current non-educational charges
                           (e.g. parking tickets, library fines, etc.) within the same award year as the Title
                           IV funds. Without your authorization, your federal aid will pay only current tuition,
                           fees, Dining Dollars and dorm room charges. Federal regulations prohibit using current Title IV funds to pay any prior award/academic
                              year outstanding charges. Your account will remain on hold until you pay all past
                              due charges owed to The University of Memphis.
                        
                        Access and complete the Title IV Authorization Form online and submit to the Financial Aid Office, 103 Wilder Tower. Failure to do so
                           will require payment in full of any outstanding charges and may result in a delay
                           of processing financial aid excess refunds and/or deletion of classes. In addition
                           to the Title IV Authorization Form, a repayment agreement may be required to be completed
                           with the Bursar's Office.
                        
                        
                        If above conditions are satisfied and/or if receiving non Title IV funds to pay outstanding
                           charges, registration holds will be released beginning August 1 for Fall terms, December
                           1 for Spring terms, and May 1 for Summer terms. Grades/Transcript holds will not be
                           released until account balance is paid in full.
                        
                        
                        State Law prohibits the release of a registration hold for any student who owes debt
                           to the University.
