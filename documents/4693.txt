                     Endowed Faculty Positions (Professorships and Chairs)
                     
                     The quality of a university's faculty drives the success of its academic programming.
                        The University of Memphis is committed to investing in its faculty to ensure the integrity
                        and quality of our academic programs. One way universities provide incentives to recruit
                        and retain outstanding faculty is through annually-awarded professorships. Endowed
                        Chairs and Professorships provide support and recognition to faculty who have earned
                        distinction in research, teaching, and outreach. 
                     
                     
                     Among many roles, professors who hold endowed positions typically aid with faculty
                        development, secure additional external funding, conduct vital research and design
                        and expand curriculum. In turn, our students benefit from stronger programs and have
                        the opportunity to study under the mentorship of a prominent expert in the field.
                     
                     
                     Endowed faculty positions and chairs can be established to benefit a particular program,
                        a college or the University as a whole. For more information, contact Bobby Prince,
