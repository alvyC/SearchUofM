                     Your first week at the University of Memphis will be exciting, but in all the rush,
                        there are some things you must do in order to make your transition to college life
                        smooth.
                     
                     
                     Check location of classes Check myMemphis to CONFIRM buildings and room numbers for classes, at least 48 hours
                        prior to class. Room assignments may change after you have registered and printed
                        your schedule.
                     
                     
                     Register your car now All cars on campus must be registered and have the parking permit displayed or they
                        are subject to ticketing and/or towing. You should have received your parking hang
                        tag from Parking Services in the mail prior to the semester beginning.
                     
                     
                     Buy all your books early Get your required texts for all your classes at the beginning of the term. The bookstore
                        sometimes runs short, and books may be hard to get later. Most required materials
                        (as well as other school supplies) are available at the University Bookstore near
                        the University Center. Keep all receipts—if you need to return your book because of
                        schedule changes (or because you bought the wrong text), you'll need the receipt for
                        a full refund.
                     
                     
                     Go to all your classes and read the syllabus Each of your teachers will pass out a syllabus within the first couple of days of
                        the semester. Read each syllabus carefully and ask questions about any unclear parts.
                        Go to all classes—don't make the mistake of thinking that it is okay to miss the early
                        lectures. This is when your teachers set out the goals, expectations and even the
                        mood of the classroom. Faculty are required to report attendance to the financial
                        aid office, to ensure eligibility. Faculty are also encouraged to submit "early intervention"
                        reports for poor attendance as well as other behaviors which may interfere with success
                        in class. We can't say it enough, go to class!
                     
                     
                     Add or drop classes correctly During the first week you have the opportunity to adjust your schedule by dropping
                        and adding classes. IT IS UP TO YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BEEN DROPPED FROM A CLASS
                        ROSTER IF YOU DROP! If you simply stop attending the class, you may receive an "F"
                        on your grade report at the end of the semester.
