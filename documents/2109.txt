                              What is the difference in School Based and Camp us Based Dual Enrollment?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              The high school based initiative is a special program offered at several area high
                                 schools. The campus based "concurrent enrollment" program refers to courses taken
                                 on the main campus or satellite campuses. Concurrent enrollment has different admissions
                                 standards.
                                 
                              
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              4.
                              
                              How many courses can a student take per term?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              The high school based program will allow two per semester. The main campus program
                                 allows one per semester.

                              Can I use these courses toward high school graduation?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              Yes, with the approval of your high school.
                                 
                              
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              6.
                              
                              Do you have specific courses offered for Dual Enrollment?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              Consult your high school guidance counselor for the course offerings at your school.
                                 Common courses offered in this program include English Composition, U.S. History,
                                 College Algebra, Elementary Calculus, and Biology. Some schools are offering other
                                 courses.
                                 
                              
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              7.
                              
                              Will Dual Enrollment courses transfer to other colleges and universities?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              It has been our experience that in most cases the courses transfer without a problem.
                                 However, I would consult the school(s) you are planning to attend after high school
                                 graduation to be sure.
                                 
                              
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              8.
                              
                              If I leave the school mid-semester, may I continue my Dual Enrollment class at my
                                    new school?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              If the new high school does not offer the same Dual Enrollment course through the
                                 University of Memphis, the student would not be able to continue in the UofM dual
                                 enrollment program.
                                 
                              
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              9.
                              
                              One of my parents is a state employee or works at the University of Memphis.  Will
                                    I receive an additional discount for my Dual Enrollment class?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              The cost of the high school based program courses has already been significantly discounted
                                 and therefore additional discounts do not apply. However, those discounts may be applied
                                 to those courses taken on the main campus that have not been discounted.
                                 
                              
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              10.
                              
                              What if I do not have a test score, am I eligible to take a course?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              Students must have taken the ACT, SAT, PSAT, PLAN or ASPIRE prior to entering the
                                 program. The PSAT, PLAN, or ASPIRE can only be used if the student has not taken the
                                 ACT or SAT.
                                 
                              
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              11.
                              
                              If I do not meet the requirements, can I get an exception?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              Exceptions are not typically granted for this program but will be evaluated on an
                                 individual basis if requested by the high school.

                              The information you need is on your acceptance letter from the Admissions Office.
                                 If you no longer have that letter, you can call Information Technology support office
                                 (678-8888) and identify yourself as a Dual Enrollment student to request your User
                                 Name and Temporary Password. You must be prepared to give the technician either a
                                 Social Security number or your student U number (individual student U numbers are
                                 listed on the class rosters sent to teachers early in the semester)

                              Are there specific courses offered for Dual Enrollment at your institution for the
                                    Campus Based program?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              There are no specific courses that are offered just for Dual Enrollment students.
                                 Once a student decides what subject they are interested in the student will be required
                                 to seek approval from the academic department to enroll in the selected class.

                              Is financial aid available for Dual Enrollment?

                              I received a letter / phone call saying that I will be dropped from the class for
                                    nonpayment of fees. What do I do?
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              If you have paid your fees to your high school, you will not be dropped. The computer
