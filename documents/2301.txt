                     Our Masters of Science degree (M.S.) is designed so that upon completion of the program,

                     The mission of the CMH Counseling program faculty is to prepare counselors who will ethically promote the emotional well-being of :
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Individuals (childhood through adulthood)
                        
                        Families
                        
                        Diverse client populations located in urban, rural and international settings.
                        
                     
                     
                     Individuals admitted into the program learn in a dynamic, experiential environment
                        which affords students opportunities to achieve academic, professional, and personal
                        success
                     
                     
                     The program requires completion of a minimum of sixty (60) graduate hours of academic
                        coursework, and includes the successful completion of a practicum (3 graduate hours/150
                        clock hours) a clinical internship (9 graduate hours/600 clock hours) and successfully
                        passing a written comprehensive examination. Clinical mental health courses are held
                        both in the daytime and evenings, as many students work part-time or full-time while
                        pursuing their degree.
