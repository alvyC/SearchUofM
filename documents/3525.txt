                     DIVERSITY
                     
                     We define diversity broadly to include several aspects of human differences that contribute
                        to the intellectual discourse and inclusive environment at the University of Memphis
                        School of Law.
                     
                     
                     The Student Affairs Office of Diversity collaborates with a variety of law school
                        offices and community groups to ensure a diverse and inclusive law school environment.
                        These collaborations allow us to develop and implement initiatives that increase the
                        access, admission, retention, and graduation of diverse students. Upon admission to
                        law school, the Office of Diversity offers one-on-one counseling and support for students
                        and student organizations and encourages each student to take advantage of available
                        University services.
                     
                     
                     Access Initiatives
                     
                     Our access initiatives and recruiting efforts work to ensure prospective students
                        from historically underrepresented populations have access to information regarding
                        the legal profession, the law school admission process, and financial aid opportunities.
                     
                     
                     Access initiatives include the Summer Law Intern Program (SLIP) in partnership with
                        the Memphis Bar Association;  Diversity & Pre-Law Day; the Tennessee Institute for
                        Pre-Law (TIP) Program; and a FREE 2-day Access & Diversity LSAT Prep Course.

                     Scholarships
                     
                     A number of scholarships are available to entering students, including diversity awards, academic merit awards, and
                           awards for students with demonstrated financial need. Through state appropriations
                           and the generous donations of law school alumni and friends, over $600,000 in scholarship
                           assistance has traditionally been awarded in previous academic years. Awards range
                           from $1,000 to full in-state tuition.
