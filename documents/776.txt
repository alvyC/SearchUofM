                        pursue graduate study. The University of Memphis offers equal educational opportunity
                        to all persons, without regard to race, religion, sex, age, creed, color, national
                        origin, or physical handicap.
                     
                     
                     Students are admitted to the University of Memphis through a cooperative effort of
                        the Graduate School and the departments, colleges, and schools of the University.
                        When the Graduate School receives the student's application material, an official
                        file is established and reviewed. The department then reviews the application file
                        and makes a recommendation to the Graduate School. The Graduate School notifies applicants
                        as soon as a decision has been reached.
                     
                     
                     Applicants are required to meet admissions criteria established by the Graduate School
                        in order to enroll in graduate courses. In order to be admitted to a degree program
                        in any academic unit, applicants are also required to meet any additional standards
                        set by the unit or college. Applicants are selected on a competitive basis and, therefore,
                        admission is not granted to all applicants who meet only the minimum requirements.
                        Past behavior and classroom performance can be considered in admissions decisions.
                        Some academic programs have individual application forms and additional requirements
                        such as portfolios, proficiency examinations, auditions, etc.
                     
                     
                     Individual program requirements described in the University of Memphis Graduate Bulletin
                           2016-2017, are subject to change. Please contact the academic department or the Graduate
                           School for changes. Domestic graduate admission applications will only be accepted through Self-Service
                        Banner. The Office of Admissions no longer accepts hard-copy (paper) applications.
                        Please visit the Graduate School web site for program addresses, deadlines, and additional
                        information. Deadlines and requirements may differ for each program.
                     
                     
                     Prospective students should check with the appropriate program for specific deadlines
                           and admissions requirements. For admission to a degree program, applicants should allow approximately three to
                        six weeks from date of receipt of complete application for the necessary credentials
                        to be processed by the appropriate degree program and the Graduate School. Applicants
                        are urged to apply early to ensure full consideration. Late domestic applicants may
                        be admitted as graduate non-degree students and as such are not guaranteed placement
                        in specific programs; some classes may be closed to non-degree students. International
                        applicants should allow at least four months for the application process; they can
                        not be admitted as non-degree students.
                     
                     
                     All applications must be accompanied by a non-refundable application fee ($35.00 for
                        domestic applicants; $60.00 for international applicants), unless previously paid.
                        Applications received without the application fee will not be processed.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis requires all applicants born after January 1957 to have
                        had the measles (MMR) vaccination after January 1, 1980, in order to be admitted.
                        See "Miscellaneous Information" for additional information.
                     
                     
                     Return completed applications and required credentials to Graduate Admissions, FedEx
                        Institute of Technology Building, Suite 201, Memphis, Tennessee 38152. The applicant
                        is advised to have all credentials on file well in advance (preferable six weeks)
                        of the beginning of the term for which application is made.
                     
                     
                     See " Admission of International Students " for details about additional requirements for international applicants.
                     
                     
                     All credentials become the property of the University and will not be forwarded or
                        returned. If the applicant does not enroll, credentials will be maintained in active
                        files for 12 months, after which they will be destroyed. After that time, candidates
                        must reapply for admission and submit a new set of credentials if they wish to be
                        admitted to the Graduate School. Students who do not enroll for a Fall or Spring semester
                        must apply for readmission.
