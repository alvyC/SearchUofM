                     Begin Preparation for the ACT/SAT
So you're doing very well in high school - you have a good grade point average. What more should you be concerned with? The ACT and/or the SAT are the two primary college entrance examinations taken by American high school students. Your ability to perform well on these exams is critical for university admissions. The average entrance exam score of incoming University of Memphis freshmen is 22 on the ACT and 1040 on the SAT. However, you should keep in mind that the higher your score (in combination with your GPA) , the greater your chances of being scholarship eligible .
You are encouraged to begin preparation early for the ACT or SAT and take practice tests whenever possible. Preparation resources, and practice tests are available online for the ACT and the SAT . Your high school guidance counselor will be able to provide you additional information in regards to preparing for the exam/s.
