                     Application Acknowledgement
Following completion and successful submission of the online application, you will receive an immediate confirmation of receipt.
One to three business days after submission your application (online or paper) will be reviewed by an admissions analyst. Following this review you will receive an official acknowledgement message. The acknowledgement message will arrive in your personal e-mail account (if provided on the application) or by standard mail approximately one to three days following review.
The acknowledgement message will provide you information on how your application is being processed, including term of application and student level. This information is important for you to know in the event something is incorrect on the application – you can contact our office to correct it. Please note: Once an application has been submitted online, you will be unable to make corrections or updates yourself.
You will also receive your University of Memphis assigned ID in the acknowledgement message. This ID is referred to as your student ID, Banner ID, or U number . The ID is important as you move through the admissions / enrollment process.
This acknowledgment message should not be confused with an offer of acceptance.
