                     The vision of the College of Arts and Sciences Alumni Chapter is to develop a comprehensive
                        alumni program of national stature that will have a positive influence on the College

                        The Chapter promotes and focuses alumni support for the benefit of the College, and
                           the concepts for developing the organizational policies will be determined by the
                           Chapter's leadership.
                        
                        
                        People are the Chapter's most important resource. We will build on our diversity to
                           create a stimulating, enjoyable, and meaningful experience that encourages the participation
                           and support of alumni.
                        
                        
                        We are committed to a high standard of ethics that encompasses honesty, openness,
                           fairness, and integrity in all our processes and practices.
                        
                        
                        To reflect favorably upon the image of the College and its alumni and to develop loyalty,
                           we will always strive to provide excellent services and high-quality programming.
                        
                        
                        We will seek to work cooperatively with the College administration, faculty, students,
                           and alumni to aggressively pursue the development of new programs and creative solutions
