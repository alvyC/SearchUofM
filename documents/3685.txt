                        to you as quickly as possible, we are asking for your consent to receive notification
                        of your 1098-T tax form electronically.
                     
                     
                     Just sign in to TigerXpress through myMemphis and click on the  "Accept Consent" button when it pops up.  If you have forgotten your password, just go to https://iam.memphis.edu and reset it so that you can access the consent button!
                     
                     
                     However, If you would like to receive a paper copy of your 1098T form, click on the
                        "I Do Not Consent" button.
                     
                     
                     If electronic consent is not received by January 15, 2017, the 1098-T will be sent
                        via US Mail to the current address on file.  Please ensure that your mailing address
                        is correct.
                     
                     
                     If you do not receive your 1098-T form for 2016, or if your address has changed, you
                        may log into TigerXpress to print your 1098-T.
                     
                     
                     The benefits to you of receiving an electronic notification are:
                     
                     
                        
                        Online delivery provides access to the form 1098-T earlier than the traditional mailing
                           process. You may be able to file your tax return earlier!
                        
                        
                        Online delivery eliminates the chance that the 1098-T will get lost, misdirected or
                           delayed during delivery, or misplaced once you receive it.
                        
                        
                        Signing up for online delivery is easy and secure.
                        
                        You can receive your 1098-T form even while traveling or on assignment away from your
                           home address.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Please note: Electronic consent will remain in effect until you email your withdrawal
                           of consent electronically to bursar2@memphis.edu
