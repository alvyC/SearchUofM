                     Advising guidelines for the Bachelor of Professional Studies (B.P.S.) degree with
                        a concentration in Disability Studies and Rehabilitation Services are designed for
                        students seeking to be academically and professionally grounded in issues faced by
                        individuals seeking disability services. Students will also be exposed to the theme
                        of employment â including vocational adjustment and appropriate job placement â and
                        independent living outcomes as reaffirmed in the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of
                        1992. Rehabilitation depends heavily upon communication between both the consumer
                        and professional and among various professionals; consequently, communication will
                        be stressed, as well as an understanding of the potential influence of cultural diversity
                        and individual lifestyle choices. Courses will also enable students to understand
                        the methods used in disability services to solve consumer problems and utilize available
                        resources. Finally, a well-supervised field experience component will provide students
                        the opportunity to integrate classroom principles and develop entry-level skills in
                        a work setting.
