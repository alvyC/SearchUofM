                     June 8 - 16, 2016
                     
                     Interest Meeting: Wed, Feb 10th , 2016, noon to 1pm, Room 322 Manning Hall (Anthro Research Lab), University of Memphis 
                     
                     
                     Set in the beautiful Simeto Valley, in Eastern Sicily, UofM students and faculty will
                        engage with Simeto residents and officials in an action-research process aimed at
                        revitalizing a declining historic neighborhood through advanced historic preservation
                        and community development strategies. The focus will be on restoration strategies
                        for an old railroad, including the historic train station in the San Marco area, in
                        the city of Paternò. The main challenge is to preserve the existing cultural richness
                        and authenticity while addressing the fast economic and population decline.
                     
                     
                     This engaged-learning experience is part of an ongoing collaboration between the University
                        of Memphis and the Simeto Community, within the framework of an internationally renowned
                        community development plan for the Simeto Valley, called the "SIMETO RIVER AGREEMENT".
                        Within the broad framework offered by such Agreement, which has identified Historic
                        Neighborhood Revitalization among its top priorities, the class offers the opportunity
                        to link economic sustainability with socio-cultural and eco-environmental dimensions
                        of development.
