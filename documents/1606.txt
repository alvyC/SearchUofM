                     Spring 2017 online permit sales begin Tuesday, December 6, 2016.
                     
                     Faculty/Staff Faculty/Staff appeals will now be heard on the last Thursday of the month at 1:30
                        pm in the Parking & Transportation Services office on the ground floor of the Zach
                        Curlin Parking Garage. New permits to faculty and staff have been distributed. If you have not received a
                        new permit (which starts with the numeral 8) please contact us ASAP. Almost all of
                        the new gates have been installed and are operational. If you approach a new gate
                        that is down and you have not yet received your new permit, you will need to use the
                        callbox to gain access. Because of continuous problems with the existing callboxes,
                        all will be replaced soon. You can always call our office at 901-678-2212 if having
                        trouble at a gate.
                     
                     
                     Students New permits have been mailed to all students who registered before 8/14/16. If you
                        have not received a new permit, please contact us ASAP. Priority parking is sold out
                        except for evening access and a few resident lots.

                        Because the spaces for the rec center have not yet been lost, we will actually have
                        more parking than ever for the first day of class. Lot 18 (new resident lot for South
                        Hall) is almost finished, but it may not be ready before classes start.
                     
                     
                     New Permits
                     
                     We will begin the transition to new AVI (automatic vehicle identification) technology
                        this summer which means new UofM parking permits. These permits use RFID technology
                        to provide hands-free access to gated lots, if purchased. There are a few things to
                        keep in mind when using the new permits:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        The gates are being switched to the new technology one at a time. If a gate has not
                           yet been upgraded, it will be necessary to use the "old" magnetic strip permit to
                           enter. Depending on one's level of access, it may be necessary to enter different
                           areas with different permits. For these reasons we are asking that you keep your old
                           permit in your vehicle even if you have received a new permit. You may still need
                           it!
                        
                        
                        You can still use the gate phones to reach our office or Police Services.
                        
                        Testing on the new technology has already started and we hope to have all the gates
                           on campus converted before the start of the Fall semester.
                        
                        
                        Please contact our office at 901.678.2212 if you are experiencing any trouble with
                           your new RFID permit.

                     **We are switching from foil validation stickers to fade-resistant stickers. During
                           testing of the new RFID permits we learned that the foil stickers interfere with the
                           system's ability to read the permit. Faculty/staff who park in either garage or Lot
                           53 Statesman should already have received a new RFID permit. If you park in these
                           lots and have not received one OR if you have an RFID permit with foil stickers, please
                           contact the parking office to get your new permit.**
