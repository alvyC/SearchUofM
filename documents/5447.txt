                     June 4, 2015 - Patriot Bank is making a gift of $25,000 to the University of Memphis'
                        Finish Line program. The gift was announced at today's meeting of the Millington Rotary
                        Club.
                     
                     
                     The Finish Line program encourages students who have dropped out after earning 90
                        or more credit hours to return to school to finish their degrees at low or no cost.
                        Many of these students have to abandon their dreams of earning a degree because they
                        have exhausted their financial aid or due to social factors, such as having to work
                        full time to support a family. Finish Line students may take traditional or online
                        courses, and may receive Experiential Learning Credit for knowledge or skills gained
                        outside the University. Some earn credit through national exams..... Read More

                     Helping More Students Complete College: The Role of Emergency Aid

                     This election season has brought much attention – at least among the Democrats – to
                        increasing college enrollment. Proposals have ranged from making community college
                        loan-free to making it completely free. But we know that simply getting more people
                        started in college has little impact, if they fail to earn a degree or certificate.
                        It's completion – not enrollment – we should care about, especially when it comes
                        to four-year degrees........  Read More

                     Like many colleges and universities around the United States, the University of Memphis
                        recognized that a segment of its student population needed additional supports and

                        financial barriers to encouraging adults to return to school--but the outcomes are

                     Washington, DC – Determined to prevent low-income college students nearing graduation
                        from dropping out, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) and

                        guide detailing how universities can use micro-grants to ensure such students complete
                        their degree.
