                        About Dr. Duke
                        
                        Michael Duke is a Social/Medical Anthropologist (University of Texas at Austin 1996)
                           with over 20 years of experience carrying out social research focusing on the intersection
                           of labor, substance abuse, migration, gender and masculinity, sexuality, and mental
                           health, particularly among Latin American and Pacific Islander immigant populations.
                           He is also a nationally recognized expert on qualitative and mixed method research,
                           particularly with hard-to-reach populations, and has written and lectured extensively
                           on this topic.
                        
                        
                        Prior to coming to the University of Memphis, Dr. Duke served as Principal Investigator
                           or Co-Investigator on multiple studies, including an investigation of mental health
                           treatment barriers for Puerto Rican adolescents and a large, National Institute of
                           Health-funded study of heavy drinking and sexual risk among New England-based farmworkers.
                           This was followed by an investigation on the physical and mental health effects of
                           migration on a rural sending community in Mexico. He also served as Co-Investigator
                           of a study on syringe sharing and HIV risk among injection drug users in China's Guangdong
                           Province.
                        
                        
                        Dr. Duke's subsequent research focused on heavy drinking and their associated problems
                           among blue collar populations, specifically construction workers, restaurant workers,
                           and military personnel. More recently, he served as Principal Investigator on two
                           additional studies; one focusing on problem drinking and partner violence among farmworkers
                           in San Diego County, CA, and the other on stress and alcohol use among day laborers.
                        
                        
                        Dr. Duke joined the faculty of the University of Memphis in 2011. He is the founding
                           member and Chair of the Anthropology and Mental Interest Group (AMHIG) of the Society
                           for Medical Anthropology.

                                    Dr. Duke's primary project consists of a community-based participatory research study
                                       on the physical and mental health needs of Marshall Islanders residing in Northwest
                                       Arkansas. Specifically, the study focuses on the relationship between migration patterns,
                                       health care access, traditional healing practices, labor, and historical trauma. As
                                       an extension of this work, he is beginning a research project in collaboration with
                                       the Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese focusing on indigenous perceptions of alcohol
                                       use, drinking patterns, and prevention strategies.
                                    
                                    
                                    Lastly, Dr. Duke has several projects in development focusing on the causes, correlates,
                                       and measurement of acculturative stress among immigrant populations, and occupational
                                       stress among low income workers.
