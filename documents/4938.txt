                        About Professor Blatti
                        
                        Professor Blatti joined the department in 2008. He received his D.Phil and B.Phil
                           from Oxford University and his BA from Ohio State University. He has been the recipient
                           of a Templeton Foundation fellowship and has held positions at Duke University and
                           the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At the University of Memphis, he
                           has served as Chair of the Department of Philosophy and Director of the Marcus W.
                           Orr Center for the Humanities. Currently, he (again) serves as Editor of the Southern Journal of Philosophy . He is also an affiliate faculty member of the Institute for Intelligent Systems .
                        
                        
                        Blatti's primary area of research is metaphysics—specifically, the problem of personal
                           identity—though his work extends to related topics in philosophical psychology (e.g.,
                           animal cognition), in philosophy of biology (e.g., nature of organic life, dynamic
                           systems), in ontology (e.g., material constitution, metaontology), and at the intersection
                           of metaphysics and ethics (e.g., death, animal studies).
                        
                        
                        In 2016-17, he will be a Visiting Scholar in the Department of Philosophy at George
                           Washington University.
