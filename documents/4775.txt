		Be Aware of Phishing Attempts

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		Sophisticated email phishing attempts are being conducted in an effort to compromise University computers.  Users are, therefore, reminded to use caution when opening any email attachments or clicking any links within suspicious emails.
Please review the ITS security web pages for additional information regarding phishing attempts: ( http://www.memphis.edu/its/security/phishing.php ).
Thank you!
Ellen

		Desktop Security

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		Colleagues,
In order to comply with TBR guideline G-052 ( https://policies.tbr.edu/guidelines/access-control ) and best practices for desktop security, desktop sessions should be locked after 20 minutes of inactivity.  ITS is investigating how to implement this change throughout the University with as little impact as possible and we are considering a phased roll-out beginning in administrative units, followed by academic units.
An additional consideration, however, is the impact on instructor workstations in classrooms and student lab computers.  We’d appreciate your feedback on this issue while we are in the early planning stages.
You can leave your comments, concerns and suggestions below, or you may email Jude Knight (jknight3), who will compile all of them and share them with the ITS team.
Thank you for your input.
Ellen
