                           of attendance at the University may be eligible for a refund of enrollment fees based

                     Please note that the specific dates for these refund periods are found in the term
                        calendar for each semester at http://bf.memphis.edu/finance/bursar/calendars.php . The refund period ends earlier than the final deadline for dropping a course or

                     The University's refund policy is based entirely upon the official date of withdrawal
                        or change of course that would result in a refund. Refunds beyond the specified dates
                        or percentages will not be made for reasons such as employment conflicts, relocating
                        out-of-town, or other reasons that are beyond the University's control or responsibility.
                     
                     
                     Registration fee refunds will be processed and mailed to students beginning approximately
                        ten (10) days after classes begin and should usually be completed within four weeks.
                        The University will offset against proposed refunds any amount owed by the student
                        to the University.
