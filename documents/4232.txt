                     TLSAMP
                     
                     The UofM is a partner in the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation
                        (TLSAMP) whose goal is to increase the number of underrepresented students in Science,
                        Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) at UofM by at least 100% within a five-year
                        period. This partnership provides mentors, tutors, supplemental instruction, and a
                        summer bridge program. TSLAMP also serves as resource for undergraduate research opportunities
                        and sponsors an annual student research symposium where students can present their
                        research to faculty, the community and their peers. For more information visit memphis.edu/tlsamp/.
                     
                     
                     
                     CRISTAL Math Bootcamp 
                     
                     (formerly known as the MemphiSTEM Bootcamp)
                     
                     This was a five-year NSF-funded project which involved STEM disciplines across campus.
                        Through STEM clubs and networking activities, support for undergraduate STEM research
                        experiences, mentoring, tutoring, and STEM learning communities, MemphiSTEM worked
                        to increase the number of STEM graduates at the university. In addition, MemphiSTEM
                        supported a one-week refresher seminar (Math Bootcamp) made available to incoming
                        freshman and other UofM students to boost math skills, demonstrate links between math,
                        science and engineering and broaden the knowledge of career opportunities in STEM
                        fields. MemphiSTEM came to a close in 2015 but the legacy of this grant lives on. 
                        CRISTAL now sponsors the Math BootCamp; and we are looking forward to Math Bootcamp
                              2017.   For more information on MemphiSTEM's influence on the UofM campus please visit memphis.edu/memphistem/.

                     In September 2010, the University of Memphis was awarded a second TRIO Program specifically
                        for 120 eligible students who are enrolled in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
                        and Mathematics) majors at the UofM. Students must meet the eligibility requirements
                        to become TRIO STEM Participants. The program is very competitive with a limited number
                        of openings each year to maintain 120 participants. The STEM Program is housed in
                        405 Mitchell Hall. Mr. Melvin Harding (mharding@memphis.edu) is the director for the
                        Student Success Program.  Please visit their website for specific details and opportunities to connect with retention counselors for this
                        program.
