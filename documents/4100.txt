                        for the notary to be validated and forwarded to the Tennessee Secretary of State for
                        the apostille to be added. This process is typically requested by the graduate who
                        needs a notarized diploma to be sent internationally.
                     
                     
                     What is needed from student-
                     
                     1. Order a diploma online via the Commencement Office website (www.memphis.edu/commencement
                        - click on "Diplomas" on the left side of the screen then click "Reorder diplomas"
                        on the right side of the screen). Indicate on the order form that the diploma should
                        be delivered/mailed to Registrar in the Registrar's Office. Student should contact
                        Registrar prior to ordering so she will know to expect the diploma and that an apostille
                        is needed.
                     
                     
                     2. Send a letter to Registrar that lists where you want the diploma delivered after
                        the apostille has been added. Office of the Registrar University of Memphis 003 Wilder Tower Memphis, TN 38152
                     
                     
                     3. Enclose two checks or money orders: Made out to "Shelby County Clerk" in the amount of $5.00 Made out to "Tennessee Secretary of State" in the amount of $2.00
                     
                     
                     4. Also, provide Registrar with a FedEx account number that will be used three times:
                        delivery to Shelby County Clerk, delivery to Tennessee Secretary of State, and delivery
                        to the final destination.
                     
                     
                     If you have family or friends in the Memphis area that can assist, it is easier. If
                        that is the case, then a friend or family member can pick up the notarized diploma
                        from the Registrar's Office and take it to the Shelby County Clerk in downtown Memphis.
                        There, they would pay the processing fee to the Shelby County Clerk, leave a check
                        for the Tennessee Secretary of State, as well as pre-pay the delivery charges.
