                     Once financial aid eligibility is determined, the Financial Aid Office offers students
                        a Financial Aid Package which is posted on their myMemphis account.  It consists mainly of student loans to meet as much of the student's need
                        as possible. Enrolled hours, residency classification, cumulative grade point average,
                        and other financial assistance already received or expected will affect the amount

                     Many foundations, corporations, and service organizations provide funds for scholarships
                        or tuition assistance. Students generally apply directly to the potential donor, and
                        usually there is a direct relationship between the student and the sponsoring organization.

                     Alternative Loans
                     
                     Private loans is an option for graduate students who do not show financial aid eligibility
                        for other types of financial aid, or who need additional funds to meet educational
                        expenses. Most private alternative loans require a credit check.
                     
                     
                     Many of these alternative loan programs also look at what financial aid you are already
                        receiving for that particular period. Other financial aid assistance is deducted from
                        the cost of attendance (as determined by the institution) before aid eligibility is
                        determined for other programs.  The following link includes the names and contact

                     IMPORTANT NOTICES: The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 significantly changed the tax status of scholarships,
                        fellowships, and grants you receive from the university. Prior to the Act, they were
                        generally not subject to income tax. Since then scholarship, fellowship, and grant
                        amounts exceeding tuition, fees, and course-related books, supplies, and equipment
                        have become taxable.

                        aid amounts must be considered in determining total aid eligibility.
