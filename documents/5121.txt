                     Who are Emerging Leaders? If you look at the student featured at the top of this page,
                        you can learn a little more about who they are. Emerging Leaders are active and engaged
                        students who are learning a great deal about themselves and leadership. They come
                        from over 100 high schools and 17 states. They are leading on our campus and in the
                        community. They are proud University of Memphis Tigers!
                     
                     
                     Our Philosophy
                     
                     The Emerging Leaders Scholarship Program will be centralized around the Leadership Identity Development (LID) Model. Components
                        of the program will have an academically-strengthened foundation in research, but
                        its outcomes will be intended toward application supporting the UofM LEAD Mission
                        and Goals and progressing students through stages of the LID.
                     
                     
                     Emerging Leaders graduates will view leadership as a relational process that may be enhanced by formal position
                        but is not contingent upon it. Graduates will act upon the opportunity to exercise
                        leadership from anywhere within a team or community. They will utilize integrity,
                        communication, critical thought, and comprehensive knowledge of leadership research
                        as their tools to enhance relationships, commit to lifelong personal development,
                        and contribute to positive social change.
                     
                     
                     Our Process
                     
                     Students who are selected for Emerging Leaders commit to four years of learning responsibilities,
                        in addition to their receipt of the scholarship. As long as those responsibilities
                        are fulfilled, students continue to progress with the program. Take a look at the
                        Freshman Obligations document to get a better picture of the program's 1st year. Similar documents for
                        the 2nd-4th years can be found on the Current Emerging Leaders section.
                     
                     
                     In addition to these responsibilities to aid your personal and professional development,
                        Emerging Leaders are offered a network of supporters. First-year students live together
                        in a residence hall community and have an upperclassman to assist as a mentor. Second
                        and third-year student are offered unique opportunities to connect with local companies
                        and non-profits. Throughout the experience, students are supported by program staff
                        through formal meetings and more casual interactions.
                     
                     
                     Your Next Step
                     
                     The application for Fall 2017 Freshmen will open on November 15, 2016. The deadline
                        to submit your application is February 1, 2017 for students starting college as a
                        first-time, first-semester freshman. Due to application volume, we are unable to commit
                        to communicating when an application has been received so you may want to contact
                        us a week after submitting the application to confirm.
                     
                     
                     Once the application deadline passes, program staff reviews all applications, scoring
                        them according to a rubric that considers academics, high school involvement, community
                        service, essay responses, and recommendations. This process typically takes 2-3 weeks.
                        Invitations are then extended for up to 150 applicants to complete an interview. Interviews
                        will take place in mid-February each year. Final selections for the 50 available spaces
                        in the program are communicated in late March to early April.
