                     What is the Emerging Leaders Program?
                     
                     The Emerging Leaders Program is the premiere learning experience under the LEAD banner
                        at the University of Memphis. It began in 1983 and has been of benefit to over 700
                        students since its inception.
                     
                     
                     Emerging Leaders is a comprehensive scholarship program designed to contribute significantly
                        to a balanced, thriving college experience. The current scholarship is $5,500, but
                        the value of the program far exceeds that amount.
                     
                     
                     Whether you are a current Emerging Leader, prospective student, or family member of
