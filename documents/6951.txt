                     CHEM 4901/4902/4903 courses are offered to students who are engaged in chemical research
                        under the sponsorship of a faculty mentor either on campus or off-campus. A research
                        contract must be completed prior to obtaining a registration permit. Choose a mentor
                        (see below) and research project, complete this form , and submit the signed form to Dr. Bridson (pbridson@memphis.edu or fax: 901-678-3447).
                     
                     
                     Undergraduates can engage in research before or after they have taken CHEM 490x, or
                        even if these courses are not required for graduation. Some faculty members may have
                        government, industry, and University funding to pay hourly wages or small stipends
                        for undergraduate research. Check the MemphiSTEM  page for scholarships. Students are also welcome to volunteer in the research lab
                        when no funding is available. It still looks great on your résumé! Do not hesitate
                        to ask a faculty member about available opportunities! 
                     
                     
                     Multiple opportunities will be available for students to present the results of their
                        research at regional and national meetings. Please take a look at the webpages for
                        the current and previous Undergraduate Research Conferences held in our Department of Chemistry each February.
                     
                     
                     The faculty listed here are among those available to mentor undergraduate research
                        in chemistry. Follow the links for more details on research interests, and be sure
                        to schedule meetings with one or more faculty in order to choose a project of mutual
                        interest before completing the form referenced above.
