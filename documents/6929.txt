                     Why Internships?
                     
                     Internships are excellent opportunities for students to apply what they learn in the
                        classroom in a "real world" context. For employers, internships provide an effective
                        recruiting strategy for new entry level talent and a chance to "interview" for upcoming
                        positions.
                     
                     
                     In addition, the Fogelman College of Business & Economics offers students the opportunity
                        to apply their course content in "real world" settings. Students have the option to
                        apply for academic credit for their internship if they meet the minimum qualifications
                        (2.75 GPA and 60 hours of completed college credit, with 15 hours in upper level FCBE
                        core coursework) and have an internship description and offer letter. If approved
                        by faculty for credit within the respective major, the internship substitutes for
                        a required elective for 3 hours credit within all business majors. The Social Media
                        minor and the Supply Chain Management major both require internships as part of the
                        graduation requirements.
                     
                     
                     Benefits of an Internship
                     
                     The benefits of an internship are many! The points below highlight just a few reasons
                        that students should seek an internship! According to national research conducted by the 2014 Internship & Co-op Survey, National
                        Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE):
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        96.9% of responding employers plan to hire interns and/or co-ops students in 2014.
                        
                        Employers made a full-time offer to 64.8% of their interns in 2013.
                        
                        79% of interns accepted a full-time job offer with their internship employer in 2013.
                        
                        After one year, employers retain about three-quarters of their new college hires who
                           have had an internship experience with their organization.
                        
                        
                        Students may also seek to have non-credit internships or general elective credit for
                           internships as well.
