                     The Sport Performance and Health Consulting Center (SPAHCC) is focused on the testing of athletes and other individuals interested in learning
                        of their physical performance capabilities and related variables (e.g., metabolic
                        rate, body composition, bone density). Current members of the Center include a PhD
                        level sport biomechanist, a PhD level exercise physiologist, a sport psychology consultant
                        and professional runner, and a systems biologist.  A wide variety of athletes use
                        the Center for routine performance-based testing. Moreover, individuals who are not
                        athletic but are interested in aspects of physical health such as resting metabolic
                        rate, body composition, and bone density are routinely tested in the Center. For more
