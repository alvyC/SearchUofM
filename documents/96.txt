                     FedEx Institute of Technology Community PartnersÂ 
                     
                     On April 25th we kicked off the community partners program, an opportunity for technology-oriented
                        organizations which share the FedEx Institute's goal of making Memphis the leader
                        in emerging technologies research to come together in a spirit of collaboration and
                        connection. Memphis has more potential for excellence in technology innovation than
                        any other city, and we are committed to working with all of the organizations in Memphis
                        to realize this potential.Â 
                     
                     
                     Welcome our Newest Partner

                     The FedEx Institute of Technology introduced the Community Partners Program in April
                        of 2016. This program, designed to create strategic alliances with the community organizations
                        impacting technology trends in Memphis, was initiated with a signing ceremony between
                        the University and two key partners, Memphis Technology Foundation and Tech901. Since
                        that signing, the close partnership between the University of Memphis and the local
                        organizations committed to advancing technology skills and resources in Memphis has
                        grown significantly.
                     
                     
                     We are pleased to welcome our newest community partner, Memphis PASS (Professional Association of SQL Server) Chapter. PASS is an independent, not-for-profit
                        organization run by and for the community. With a growing membership of more than
                        100K, PASS supports data professionals throughout the world who use the Microsoft
                        data platform. PASS strives to fulfill its mission by:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Facilitating member networking and the exchange of information through our local and
                           virtual chapters, online events, local and regional events, and international conferences
                        
                        
                        Delivering high-quality, timely, technical content for in-depth learning and professional
                           development
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     PASS was co-founded by CA Technologies and Microsoft Corporation in 1999 to promote
                        and educate SQL Server users around the world. Since its founding, PASS has expanded
                        globally and diversified its membership to embrace professionals using any Microsoft
                        data technology
                     
                     
                     The Memphis PASS Chapter was founded in March 2009 and is an official chapter associated
                        with the Professional Association for SQL Server (PASS). Our mission is to provide
                        our members in the Mid-South area with a forum for education, facilitate networking,
                        and guidance around best practices in SQL Server and related products and services.
                        We normally meet on the second Thursday of every month. Membership in the group, as
                        well as attendance to our monthly meetings, is free. The Institute is changing the way the world views Memphis. If you have a passion for
                        emerging technologies and the role that technology has in shaping the future of Memphis,
