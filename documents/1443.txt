                     Accelerated B.S./M.S. Program in Computer Science
                     
                     This program allows outstanding majors in Computer Science  to begin the coursework
                        for the Master of Science in Computer Science while enrolled as undergraduates.. Students
                        are encouraged to consult their advisor and begin planning to enter the Accelerated
                        B.S./M.S. program early in their undergraduate study. The 5-ear program is designed
                        to save both cost and time as it removes some typical requirements (e.g. taking the
                        GRE exam) in a standard application for our M.S. Program. 
                     
                     
                     Candidates for the accelerated program must meet the following requirements:
                     
                     
                        
                        Complete COMP 1900, COMP 2150, COMP 2700, and at least two upper-division COMP courses
                           by the end of the semester of application.
                        
                        
                        Have a minimum 3.0 overall GPA, and a 3.6 GPA for COMP courses.
                        
                     
                     
                     To apply for the accelerated program and be allowed to take graduate classes, students should
                        submit two reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Computer Science
                        department. Applicants will be asked to complete an interview with the graduate program
                        coordinator in computer science.
                     
                     
                     The accelerated program allows up to 9 hours of graduate course work to be applied
                        to both the undergraduate and graduate programs. To continue in the graduate program
                        once the B.S. degree is completed, students must apply for full admission into the
                        Graduate School and into the Computer Science department's M.S. program. The GRE requirement
                        for graduate admission is waivedfor students in the accelerated program.
