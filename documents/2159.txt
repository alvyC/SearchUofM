                     At the University of Memphis, the study of architecture and interior design encompasses
                        both the art and science of design. The focus is on the education of the individual
                        student through a well-rounded approach in a sequence of foundation courses, design
                        studios, and professional/technical courses.  The program of study for each degree
                        program is structured to engage students in the processes and professional standards
                        of design and technology necessary for shaping the built environment. Students are
                        placed at the center of discovery-based studies, and required to assume responsible
                        participation in the study of architecture and interior design.
