                              Military families make extraordinary sacrifices, and it is difficult for civilian
                                 families to truly understand the hardships they endure. While there is no way to truly
                                 repay them for their service, there are some rewards that can help to ease their burdens.
                                 Scholarships are one way of giving back to the families of military service members,
                                 and to provide much needed financial assistance for the spouses and children of service-men
                                 and women as they pursue a college education. Scholarships for military spouses take a variety of different forms, and are supported
                                 by the various branches of the military, as well as Federal and state governments.
                                 Some scholarships target the wives and husbands of currently serving military personnel.
                                 Others are dedicated to the spouses of service members who have been killed or disabled
                                 in service to their country. The wide range of scholarships for military spouses are
                                 designed to help military family members pursue their college education. It is a small
                                 way of giving back to the military community, and it helps thousands of men and women
                                 every year to achieve their college ambitions.
