                     Purpose:Â  The purpose of this paper is to elicit tacit knowledge exhibited in expert information
                        system (IS) professionals in a form that can be shared with others; and to develop
                        categorical framework suggesting key content areas of tacit knowledge in the requirements
                        analysis domain.
                     
                     
                     Design/methodology/approach:Â  Requirements analysis is selected as the main focus of this study due to the importance
                        of this phase to the success of IS development and the nature of requirements analysis
                        tasks requiring extensive amount of tacit knowledge. The authors used the "storytelling"
                        approach, a semi-structured interview technique for knowledge elicitation.
                     
                     
                     Findings: Â The study resulted in 132 knowledge items using a qualitative method and categorized
                        them into 14 categories using cluster analysis. The study found that experienced,
                        successful analysts see systems analysis in behavioral, managerial, and political
                        terms and focus heavily on interpersonal, project management, and organizational issues.
                     
                     
                     Research limitations/implications:Â  The limitations in the research sample, or in the recollection capability of the research
                        subjects could compromise the comprehensiveness of the tacit knowledge in the requirements
                        analysis domain; however, the elicited knowledge at least represents important dimensions
                        one might reasonably find in this domain.
                     
                     
                     Originality/value:Â  Very little research has attempted to capture this tacit dimension of system analysts'
                        knowledge. Thus, capturing and transferring the tacit knowledge from experts should
                        help in the evolution of novice to expert system analysts thereby improving both their
                        effectiveness and the quality of the information systems developed.
