                     It's a spiritual thing. Religious Life is on campus to make sure that students have
                        the opportunity to worship, pray, serve others, find fellowship, and express themselves
                        spiritually. Each religious organization has a weekly worship experience (Catholic
                        Campus Ministry celebrates Mass four times a week). Students often turn to campus
                        ministers from these organizations for advice, mentorship and counsel concerning their
                        everyday needs — things like dating, finances, parents, as well as the powerful tug
                        of spiritual needs.
                     
                     
                     The campus ministers are available to lead seminars for residence halls and help the
                        campus community as a whole as needs develop. Most of the religious organizations
                        try to reach out to the campus community as well as the Memphis community at large
                        by doing things like providing Thanksgiving meals for international students, refugees
                        in the city, and the community at large and also by adopting a family at Christmas
                        or tutoring at after school programs. Many organizations also offer opportunities
                        for service work through summer missions and Alternative Spring Break Trips.
                     
                     
                     * There are twenty-one Registered Student Organizations classified as religious. Nine
                        (listed above) have denomination-supported staff, while six maintain facilities or
                        houses within a block of campus (*). These nine organizations are referred to as the
                        Religious Life Staff at the University of Memphis.
