                     University Review
                     
                     University review may begin as soon as the budget has been approved by the Office
                        of Sponsored Programs (OSP).
                     
                     
                     The PI/PD will attach a draft narrative of the project description to the PSF for
                        the purpose of routing and securing signatures. Deliver signed PSF, draft budget,
                        and proposal to OSP, 315 Administration Building.
                     
                     
                     To ensure your proposal is submitted by the deadline, please allow sufficient time
                        for review by the OSP staff.  Ideally, the OSP staff should receive the final (ready to be submitted with no updates required) proposal at least two (2) days prior
                        to the submission deadline.
                     
                     
                     The proposal will be reviewed for compliance with sponsor guidelines and university
                        policies, proper order format, and consistency of information. Any sponsored-required
                        Institutional signatures will be secured by the OSP staff.
                     
                     
                     Submission Process
                     
                     Once the PI/PD has indicated to the OSP staff that the proposal is ready to be submitted,
                        the proposal will be shipped or submitted electronically, per sponsor specifications
                        by the OSP staff. OSP staff will notify PI/PD when the proposal is submitted.
