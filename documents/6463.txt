                     Mountain Warfare School is a two-week course taught by the Vermont National Guard
                        at Ethan Allen Firing Range in Jericho, Vt.
                     
                     
                     Both a summer and a winter phase are offered. The training is designed to make you
                        an expert in mountain operations. Mountain Warfare School is both physically and mentally
                        demanding. Training is non-stop, 15 hours per day, for 14 days.
                     
                     
                     If you can carry a 65-pound rucksack up to five miles per day in mountainous terrain
                        and are competent with both day and night land navigation you may have what it takes
                        to complete this intense training. Cadets attending Mountain Warfare training must
                        be in top-notch physical condition. The majority of this course is not taught in a
                        garrison environment. It is a tough, combat arms oriented course, and many of the
                        students are from active Special Forces and Ranger battalions.
