                        is available on over 200 workstations located throughout the libraries, on the campus
                        network, and through the Internet. Faculty and staff of the University Libraries are
                        available to assist library users with identifying and making the best use of library
                        resources. The Interlibrary Loan staff will borrow resources from other libraries

                        agreements with several local academic libraries that enable direct borrowing by students,
                        faculty, and staff of the University of Memphis. For more information on library services
