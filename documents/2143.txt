                     Your Score on the ALEKS Assessment
                     
                     Immediately after completing the ALEKS Assessment, you will be shown a pie chart which indicates your placement result score on the ALEKS Assessment. The percentage
                        score above the pie chart area is your ALEKS score (Placement Result: 93%).
                     
                     
                     You can log back in to the ALEKS math placement website to view the pie chart (View Previous Results) at a later time. Clicking on the subject headings will allow
                        you to view topics you are ready to learn.
                     
                     
                     What Math Course am I Eligible to Take?
                     
                     After you have completed the ALEKS Assessment, check with your advisor regarding the
                        appropriate course for your major.  Please refer to the chart below for course placement.

                           course selection during orientation.
                        
                        
                        If you are a returning student, you should log into myMemphis and enroll in your math course for the upcoming semester.
                        
                        
                        If you need any assistance with your math course selection, please contact your academic
                           advisor.  
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Do you wish to retake the ALEKS Assessment to try to improve your score?
                     
                     You must wait 48 hours after your initial placement assessment before attempting another.
                        There is generally no benefit to re-taking the assessment immediately after completing
                        a prior attempt. Unlike the SAT or ACT, you cannot improve your results by simply
                        re-taking the assessment without spending time in the Prep and Learning Module to
                        refresh material that you may have forgotten or to learn new material.
                     
                     
                     What is the ALEKS Prep and Learning Module?
                     
                     After the assessment, a targeted Prep and Learning Module is available for you to
                        review and learn material, and to improve placement and eventual course outcomes.
                        Students must begin the Learning Module within 6 months of completing the initial
                        ALEKS assessment.
                     
                     
                     How long can I use the ALEKS Prep and Learning Module?
                     
                     Once students begin the Prep and Learning Module, they may use it for up to 6 months.
                        Students using the learning module should check the email account provided to ALEKS
                        for reminders about the amount of time remaining in the learning module. Before the
                        third ALEKS assessment, students must work in the Learning Module for 3 hours. Between
                        the third and fourth assessment, students must work in the Learning Module for at
                        least 3 hours. After the fourth assessment, students must work at least 3 hours in
                        the learning module before they can take the fifth assessment. Students who do not
                        complete 3 hours in the learning module after the second, third, or fourth assessment
                        will not be able to take the next one.
                     
                     
                     Why would I use the ALEKS Prep and Learning Module?
                     
                     
                        
                        If you do not place into the desired math course, the Prep and Learning Module may
                           assist you in reaching the required minimum score for placement into the course. Students
                           will need to retake the ALEKS assessment after working in the Prep and Learning Module
                           in order to attempt to place higher. Progress in the Prep and Learning Module does
                           not automatically result in a new placement.
                        
                        
                        All students are strongly encouraged to spend several hours using the ALEKS Prep and
                           Learning Module. Even if you have achieved placement in your desired course, time
                           spent in ALEKS will better prepare you for your upcoming course and ultimately lead
