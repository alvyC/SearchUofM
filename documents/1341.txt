                     Our Priorities
                     
                     A priority of the Vice Provost's office is to maintain the integrity of our academic
                        programs. We receive recommendations from eminent scholars and program experts during
                        the peer review and accreditation process on issues from curriculum to budget. This
                        feedback is a valuable tool used for strategic planning to improve the overall excellence
                        of our academic programs. These ongoing processes help us to attract and retain the
                        greatest faculty and brightest students.
                     
                     
                     Our Goal
                     
                     Our goal is to manage academic programs and resources to accomplish the University's
                        mission of producing dreamers, thinkers, and doers.

      Never Too Late
      
         
            "I feel grateful to finally have the diploma that I worked so hard to achieve many
               years ago, and it was awesome to see my kids in the crowd when I walked at graduation.
               My oldest son is at the U of M now on the same scholarship I had in the 80’s and it
               was great to see him learn the lesson that it is never too late to try and achieve
               your goals."
