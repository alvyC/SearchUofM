                     Background Checks FAQs
                     
                     What kinds of background checks will be conducted? Will credit checks be done? At this time, we search federal, state, and/or municipal jurisdictions for criminal
                        convictions, national sex offender registration, and driver's license history only
                        (if the position requires driving). Credit checks are not routinely done but if required,
                        will be highlighted on the position posting announcement.
                     
                     
                     Why do you conduct criminal background checks? Background checks are conducted to support workplace productivity, safety and security
                        and to ensure applicant backgrounds and qualifications are suitable for the position
                        being considered.
                     
                     
                     For what types of jobs/employees will criminal background checks be conducted? Newly-hired regular full-time and part-time administrative/professional, faculty,
                        clerical/support, and temporary staff members are subject to criminal background checks.
                        In addition, any student worker or graduate assistant whose role requires the handling
                        of keys, cash and/or children are also subject to criminal background checks.
                     
                     
                     Additionally, in accordance TN Code § 49-7-149 (2015), known as the Kristen Azevedo
                        Act, "all persons applying at public institutions of higher education for employment
                        in housing facilities owned or operated by such institutions, who shall have access
                        to student rooms or apartments, including students applying to become resident assistants
                        or resident directors, before being employed in such position, shall be required to
                        supply a fingerprint sample and submit to a criminal history records check to be conducted
                        by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
                        (FBI) or other vendor contracted for the same purposes."
                     
                     
                     Does a candidate have to give permission for a background check to be conducted? Yes. In compliance with federal requirements, candidates give permission by acknowledging
                        the Disclosure and Authorization Release portion of the online background check process.
                        If a candidate declines to give permission, a background check will not be conducted.
                        Since a background check is a requirement for employment or appointment, candidates
                        who decline this permission cannot be employed by the University.
                     
                     
                     How are background checks administered? Background checks are completed electronically through a third party vendor. A request
                        is made by the hiring department via e-mail to Workforce Management . The vendor then sends an email with appropriate instructions to the potential temporary
                        employee who must initiate and complete the information.
                     
                     
                     Will having to conduct a background check on the recommended applicant slow down the
                           hiring process? Human Resources diligently works with hiring departments to ensure a satisfactory
                        background check is received prior to the first day of employment. However, as an
                        exception, applicants may be hired "subject to" a satisfactory background check, and
                        that clause would be written into the employment agreement. New hires would be able
                        to start before the results are received by HR. Notwithstanding, if the results of
                        the check are deemed unacceptable (as outlined in the internal Guidelines for Assessing
                        Criminal Background Reports) or if it is discovered that the employee falsified any
                        of the information provided on the application, the individual will be terminated.
                     
                     
                     What happens if a candidate does not disclose any or all convictions? Falsification, including misrepresentation or failure to disclose information (omission)
                        as part of the application process or on the disclosure and authorization release,
                        may disqualify a candidate from employment/appointment whether or not the falsification
                        was intentional. Current employees may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action,
                        up to and including dismissal.
                     
                     
                     What is the cost of the background check and how will it be budgeted? Since background checks are a requirement for hire, the cost of each check is paid
                        by the Division of Business and Finance. However, departments whose operations require
                        additional or expanded checks (e.g. departments who receive grant funding and additional
                        checks are a requirement of the grant) will incur the cost of all additional checks.
                        Please contact Workforce Management for additional information.
                     
                     
                     Do you conduct background checks on student workers? Background checks are only conducted on student workers if they are hired into one
                        of the positions listed above. To obtain a comprehensive list of other positions for
                        student workers requiring background checks, you may e-mail Workforce Management .
                     
                     
                     Will the hiring department receive a copy of the background check results? No. Human Resources does not share the results received from the background check.
                        If the candidate is ineligible for hire, the department is notified the applicant
                        is not approved for (without further disclosure) and the department will then have
                        the option to select the next best qualified applicant or repost the position.
