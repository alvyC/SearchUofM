                     Computer Science faculty and students gathered today in the FIT Fishbowl in order
                        to view presentations from over 20 participants in a variety of exciting research
                        areas.Â  We awarded the top three places in each category; however, all of the participants
                        did an excellent job.Â  Each of the first place winners received tablets and second
                        and third place winners received Amazon gift certificates.
