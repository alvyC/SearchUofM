                     PhD Admissions
                     
                     The PhD program at the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders is designed
                        to prepare students for academic-research careers in speech, language, or hearing
                        sciences. The School offers a Ph.D. in Communication Sciences and Disorders with two
                        areas of concentration: (1) Hearing Sciences and Disorders or (2) Speech-Language
                        Sciences and Disorders. The program is highly individualized to the needs and background
                        of the student and is developed in accordance with the student's research interests.
                        Each student will form a planning committee upon entry into the program, and an individualized
                        course of study will be designed to meet the student's educational and long term goals.
                        Mentoring is a critical component of each student's doctoral plan. Graduation requirements
                        vary depending on the degrees the students have when entering the program. These requirements
                        are listed in the graduate catalog.
                     
                     
                     Funding available
                     
                     Full graduate assistantship funding (tuition +stipend) is available for the most meritorious
                           applicants to pursue doctoral work. We encourage applications in all our areas of
                           research (see http://www.memphis.edu/csd/research/ ) and especially in voice, fluency, and auditory amplification.
                     
                     Finding a Mentor
                     
                     Having an excellent mentor is crucial to optimizing your doctoral program. In addition
                        to your course work a significant amount of learning occurs in interaction within
                        laboratory and research settings with your mentor. This one-on-one interaction is
                        best when the mentor and student have a compatible personality and similar interests.
                        To pick a mentor first look for someone with a similar interest by looking through
                        the faculty profiles; then read their papers. Once you have found someone who looks
                        compatible, call that person and discuss your interest in the Ph.D. program. Finally,
                        visit the program so you can get to know them and other faculty members as well as
                        the general program facilities and environment. If you do not have a firm research
                        goal, and many new students do not, talk to several individuals on the faculty and
                        we can help you focus your interest areas. The person you choose as a mentor is important
                        as he/she will help guide your application through the system.
