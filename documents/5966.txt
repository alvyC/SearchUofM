                     The U of M will lead a team of researchers from three other universities â UCLA, UC
                        San Francisco, and University of Pennsylvania â on the project, entitled " mProv: Provenance-based Data Analytics Cyberinfrastructure for High-frequency Mobile
                              Sensor Data ." Other collaborators on the project include Open mHealth, Open Humans, and Quantified
                        Self.
                     
                     
                     The mProv cyberinfrastructure will annotate high-frequency mobile sensor data with
                        data source, quality, validity, and semantics to enable sharing of such data with
                        the wider research community. This will help unleash the potential of mobile sensor
                        data to improve health and wellness on an individual level by developing computational
                        models of human health and behavior.
                     
                     
                     Prof. Kumar is also the PI on the NIH-funded Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor
                        Data-to-Knowledge ( MD2K ), also involving UCLA and UCSF. The open-source software developed by MD2K allows
                        any researcher to collect, analyze, and interpret high-frequency sensor data from
                        the natural environment. However, research with such sensor data is still out of reach
                        for most researchers; it involves significant resources and expertise to acquire sensors,
                        obtain study approval, and recruit human subjects before collecting the data.
                     
                     
                     Said Kumar: âWith the mProv provenance cyberinfrastructure complementing MD2Kâs software,
                        investigators can collect, curate, analyze, and interpret mobile sensor data, as well
                        as share data. Doing so can amplify the research utility of their data and, most importantly,
                        help establish benchmarks and bring reproducibility, which are key to scientific rigor.âÂ 
                        Department chair Prof. Lan Wang stated, "By addressing fundamental challenges in data provenance and privacy, the
                        mProv project led by Dr. Kumar will likely have far-reaching impact on mobile health
                        data sharing and data science in general. The Computer Science department is proud
                        to be home to such cutting-edge research."
                     
                     
                     U of M President David Rudd added, âThis $4 million grant represents the largest single
                        NSF award received by the University of Memphis and reflects our growing reputation
                        as a hub for mobile sensor âbig dataâ and mHealth research, as well as Dr. Kumarâs
                        national and international reputation as a leader in this field.â
                     
                     
                     âEarlier this year, Google cited the MD2K Center at the U of M as a reason why Memphis
                        was named the Digital e-Capital for Tennessee,â said Dr. Andy Myers, Vice President
                        for Research at U of M. âThe new mProv project builds upon the MD2K project, and further
                        enhances the University of Memphisâ nationwide reputation as a hub for mHealth research.â
