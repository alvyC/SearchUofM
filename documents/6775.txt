                     What critical factors contribute to knowledge workers' effective information management
                        and consequent job performance? This paper begins to address this important question
                        by developing a conceptual definition of a new construct called personal information
                        management effectiveness (PIME) and its constituent dimensions. Specifically, we theorize
                        that PIME consists of two underlying dimensions: personal information management motivation
                        (PIMM) and personal information management capability (PIMC). Synthesizing the extant
                        literature on information management and information orientation, we further conceptualize
                        PIMM as having four sub-dimensions of proactiveness, sharing, transparency, and formality,
                        and PIMC as possessing five sub-dimensions of sensing, collecting, organizing, processing,
                        and maintaining. Moreover, we develop a theoretical model that positions PIME as a
                        mediator between two selected individual characteristics (IT self-efficacy and need-for-cognition)
                        and job performance. New measures for PIME dimensions were developed and shown to
                        have strong psychometric properties. The proposed model was empirically tested using
                        data collected from 352 knowledge workers. As theorized, PIME was found to have significant
                        effects on job performance (41%) and fully mediate the effects that the selected individual
                        characteristics have on job performance. Responding to recent calls for advanced research
                        on personal information management, the measures of PIMM and PIMC developed in this
                        study have practical value as research and diagnostic tools and the findings provide
                        useful insights to help organizations improve knowledge workers' information management
                        practices.
