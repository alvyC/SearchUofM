                     Advanced Moot Court Competition
                     
                     The Advanced Moot Court Competition begins shortly after Labor Day. This competition
                        gives second- and third-year students the opportunity to practice and improve skills
                        in appellate advocacy. Teams of two students write an appellate brief and then present
                        oral arguments. Each team argues both the petitioner's and respondent's position.
                        The brief is due in September and the competition begins in October.
                     
                     
                     First-year students may serve as bailiffs during oral arguments, giving them an opportunity
                        to observe appellate advocacy before competing in the Freshman Moot Court Competition
                        in the spring semester. Participation as a bailiff does not count toward Moot Court
                        credit.
                     
                     
                     Scores on the brief and from oral arguments are a factor determining eligibility for
                        membership on the Moot Court Board. Successful completion of the competition goes
                        toward obtaining credit for graduation.
                     
                     
                     The problem for the Advanced Moot Court Competition is prepared under the direction
                        of the Associate Justice for the Advanced Competition and is distributed as a part
                        of the Advanced Appellate Advocacy curriculum.

                     A student's perspective:
                     
                     "Working with a partner makes this competition slightly less nerve-wracking than the
                        Freshman. I had a great experience. I believe both my oral argument skills and courtroom
                        demeanor improved during the competition. I received constructive criticism that was
                        helpful." - Madison Patey 
                     
                     
                     Mock Trial Competition
                     
                     The Mock Trial Competition is held at the beginning of each spring semester. It is
                        open to second- and third-year students, offering them an opportunity to practice
                        and improve skills in trial advocacy. Two-person teams submit a a motion and trial
                        notebook and participate in a mock trial. Each team represents both the plaintiff
                        and the defendant.
                     
                     
                     The plaintiff team for each round must provide two witnesses and a bailiff. The defendant
                        also must provide two witnesses. It is each team's duty to ensure that witnesses are
                        briefed and prepared to testify. Participating as a witness or a bailiff provides
                        first-year students with an opportunity to experience trial advocacy. Participation
                        as a bailiff or a witness does not count towards Moot Court credit.
                     
                     
                     Students need not have completed Trial Advocacy or Evidence in order to compete successfully,
                        although it is suggested.
                     
                     
                     Scores on the trial notebook and from performance on oral arguments are factors in
                        determining eligibility for membership on the Moot Court Board. Successful completion
                        of the competition goes towards obtaining credit for graduation.

                     First Year Moot Court Competition
                     
                     The First Year Moot Court Competition begins after Spring Break. The First Year Moot
                        Court Competition is open only to first-year students. The competition is held each
                        year during the spring semester, providing first-year students with the opportunity
                        to practice and improve skills in appellate advocacy. Teams of two present oral arguments
                        based on the Legal Methods II appellate brief assignment. Each team member argues
                        both the petitioner's and respondent's position. The scores for the competition are
                        based solely on performance during the oral arguments.
                     
                     
                     The petitioner team must provide the bailiff for the round. The bailiff may be anyone
                        who is not currently a participant in the competition.
                     
                     
                     Scores from performance during oral arguments are a factor in determining eligibility

                     "This competition requires one to be flexible, because you never know what questions
                        you will get from a judge. Win or lose, this competition is a great experience. Everyone's
                        in the same boat, which means you have the potential to be the best if you drop your
                        nerves and give it your all!" - Ashley Finch
