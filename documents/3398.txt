                     The University of Memphis is a community of scholars founded on mutual respect and
                        is committed to providing a living, learning and working environment that is free
                        from sexual misconduct and harassment. Such behavior can impair or limit the educational
                        and occupational opportunities of members of the University community and have no
                        place in any academic environment. This policy applies to all University of Memphis
                        students. It defines unacceptable behavior, identifies resources for persons who have
                        been the victims of sexual misconduct, and describes the University's prevention and
                        education efforts.
                     
                     
                     Sexual misconduct in any form is a violation of both state and federal laws and may
                        be prosecuted in the criminal justice system as well as through the University's disciplinary
                        process. Legal definitions may vary from those used by the University of Memphis community
                        as outlined here. Pursuing resolution through the University's prescribed process/procedures
                        does not preclude one from pursuing criminal or civil action now or in the future,
                        and vice versa.
