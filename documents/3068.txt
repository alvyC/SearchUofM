                     The state of Tennessee requires state public institutions of higher education to verify
                        that students have received mandated immunizations and meet certain health requirements.
                     
                     
                     We have created a new system where students may upload health documents for processing.
                         After our office reviews the uploaded documentation, an email message will be sent
                        to the student's @memphis.edu email address.
                     
                     
                     You may upload immunization documentation at https://umwa.memphis.edu/immunizations
