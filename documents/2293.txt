                     Graduate Admissions
                     
                     Applicants for Fall 2017 admission must have their applications completed by January
                           13, 2017 to be guaranteed consideration for a graduate assistantship. The Graduate Admissions Committee considers applications in light of multiple factors.
                        These include the applicant's undergraduate and graduate grade point average, GRE
                        scores, statement of purpose, writing samples, relevant employment history, and letters
                        of recommendation. Admission is always contingent on the program's ability to provide
                        faculty expertise appropriate to a student's specific research interests. We encourage
                        all applicants to arrange time for a campus visit. 
                     
                     
                     Applicants whose highest degree is from a foreign university must have their credentials
                        evaluated. The committee will accept evaluations done by any credentialing agency
                        listed on the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services web site ( http://www.naces.org ). A course-by course report is required.
                     
                     
                     admissions Process
                     
                     Applicants must submit two (2) separate applications.
                     
                     Departmental Application
                     
                     Applicants submit certain materials to the Department of Communication – e.g., letters
                        of recommendation, writing samples, statement of purpose, and so on – by first creating
                        an account on DecisionDesk . 
                     
                     
                     University Application
                     
                     Applicants submit certain materials to the Graduate School – e.g., official transcripts
                        and GRE scores – via the graduate school webpage . The committee does not review an applicant's case for admission until s/he has completed
                        each of the two (2) required applications. All components – including an official
                        GRE score – must be in place before review can begin. Fall admission is standard and
                        preferred. In exceptional cases, the committee will consider applicants for Spring
                        admission to the Master's program but not to the Doctoral program.
                     
                     
                     The Department of Communication reviews applications for admission on a continuous
                        basis. If you've questions, please email Graduate Studies Coordinator, Antonio de
                        Velasco ( adevelsc@memphis.edu ).
                     
                     
                     All admissions questions should be directed to the Graduate Studies Coordinator.
