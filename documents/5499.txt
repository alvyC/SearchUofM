                     The Ed.D. program consists of 54 credit hours and extends students' knowledge and skills by preparing them to conduct reality-based
                        research that examines the role of instructional design and technology in learning. We
                        tailor your experiences and projects so that you are qualified and prepared to pursue
                        your professional goals.
                     
                     
                     IDT doctoral students commit to studying with a cohort. The course rotation schedule is available before you even begin taking classes enabling you to make plans well
                        in advance. There are some semesters in which 9 hours are taken; however, these semesters
                        are usually comprised of a 14-week class and two 7-week classes allowing you to only
                        be working on 2 classes at any one time.
                     
                     
                     Note that some, and in specific cases all, of these hours may apply towards a Master's
                        or doctorate in IDT, as well as many other graduate degrees.

                     Doctoral students are only admitted once a year in the Summer. We accept applications
                        to the doctoral program until January 31st (It's ideal if everything is submitted
                        by Jan. 15th) and then conduct our reviews and interviews in February. Notifications
                        typically go out in late February or early March.
