                     Around 10:40 PM on Friday, November 20, 2015, the University Police received a report
                        of two men with weapons near Patterson and Norriswood. A group of men and women told
                        police that as they were walking on Patterson, a man in a silver or gold Toyota Camry,
                        newer model, asked if the group knew where he could buy drugs. When one of the men
                        in the group answered “No” in a playful manner, the man in the Toyota pointed what
                        appeared to be a black rifle at the man who answered. A second man, who was the driver
                        of the Toyota, walked up and showed a pistol in his waistband. No one was injured,
                        and nothing was demanded or taken from anyone.
                     
                     
                     The man with the rifle was described as African-American, in his 20’s wearing a gray
                        hooded sweatshirt. The driver/man with the pistol in his waistband was described as
                        African-American, in his 20’s, 6’1”, 150 lbs., light complexion, wearing a black sweatshirt,
                        a green shirt under the sweatshirt, khaki shorts, and had a beard and mustache. There
                        were 2-3 other men in the Toyota, no descriptions available. The men were last seen
                        driving south on Patterson from Veterans Avenue in the Camry.

                     UPDATE FROM 05/22/2015: The University and Police Services are issuing this message as a follow-up to the
                           safety alert issued on Tuesday, May 19, 2015, and to provide updated safety information
                           to our students, faculty, staff, and visitors.
                     
                     The two men who were reported to have approached a man outside of Wilder Tower around
                           2:20 Tuesday afternoon and demanded money and threatened him, have been identified.
                           Arrest warrants for both men were issued yesterday through General Sessions Criminal
                           Court. Neither of the men have a connection to the UofM.
                     
                     I would like to take this opportunity to thank the campus community for the information
                           we received in response to our TigerText and email, which helped lead to both men
                           being identified. I would also like to thank UofM police officers Captain Kevin Langellier
                           and Detective Sammie Ballard for their prompt, thorough, and diligent work in this
