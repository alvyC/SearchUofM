                     Gifts from employees of International Paper will be used to fund scholarships to UofM
                        students who are economically disadvantaged or face other financial hardships that
                        make it extremely difficult to continue paying for tuition and college living expenses.
                     
                     
                     Scholarship opportunities, like the one IP has created, are crucially important to
                        so many bright, deserving students. Many are mid-way through a successful college
                        education when the money runs dry. These are highly motivated students, without a
                        safety net at home, who have exhausted all federal financial assistance. With several
                        years of college to go and no way to afford it, frustration and depression set in.
                     
                     
                     IP's goal is to remove some of the financial, mental and emotional stress that these
                        hardworking students face every day. Without you, they might not get to finish college.
                        With you, they become college graduates. Tigers for life.
                     
                     
                     Memphis Tigers helping other Memphis Tigers. That's what it's all about.
