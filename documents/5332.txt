                     The Baccalaureate Contract Program
                     
                     Undergraduate students admitted to University College may design either of two degrees
                        through the Baccalaureate Contract Program: the Bachelor of Liberal Studies (B.L.S.)
                        or the Bachelor of Professional Studies (B.P.S.).
                     
                     
                     To be eligible for this program, a student must have a cumulative undergraduate grade
                        point average of 2.50. Upper-division courses within the student's Coordinated Study
                        (i.e., major) must be from two or more departments on campus. In addition, the proposed
                        degree must be unlike any other degree offered by the University of Memphis.
                     
                     
                     A Baccalaureate Contract Advising Committee, comprised of faculty members from the
                        two primary departments represented in the student's Coordinated Study, will assist
                        the student in the development and execution of a degree program that serves the student's
                        needs and meets the academic requirements of University College and the University
                        of Memphis. The committee members may be regular or adjunct members of the University
                        of Memphis faculty. A third committee member is optional. The committee may direct
                        the student in the preparation of a portfolio to obtain credit for knowledge gained
                        through experience or nontraditional instruction (see Expenses and Aid for a description
                        of credit evaluation fees in this bulletin).
                     
                     
                     All baccalaureate contracts will be reviewed and approved by a baccalaurate contract
                        advisor and by the assistant dean of University College. The baccalaureate contract
                        must include work to be completed in the following areas: (1) General Education, (2)
                        Coordinated Study, (3) Thematic Studies, (4) a Senior Project, and (5) General Electives.
