                        (room 110) during regular McWherter Library hours . Non-U of M students under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult to use the
                        computers in the U of M Libraries. A valid University of Memphis ID will be required

                     • Loud, disruptive or threatening behavior is not permitted in the labs, as it is
                        a disturbance to others. Anyone engaged in behavior that disturbs others will be asked
                        to leave.
                     
                     
                     • The lab telephone is not for personal use.
                     
                     • When students are waiting to use a computer, lab monitors will ask those using computers
                        for recreation (games, web browsing not related to class/instruction, MySpace, Facebook,
                        etc.) to relinquish their seats to those needing to do their academic work.
                     
                     
                     • Installing peer to peer file sharing programs to download or upload copyrighted
                        material is prohibited. In addition, songs, videos and movies are almost always copyrighted;
                        therefore, downloading/uploading these materials through the use of peer to peer file
                        sharing can result in personal liability for copyright infringement.
                     
                     
                     • While software is available to copy CDs you may be required to show copyright permission
                        when making copies of CD's.
                     
                     
                     • Use of lab equipment to view or download sexually explicit materials may require
                        the user to demonstrate their educational purpose for such use. Lab attendants are
                        required to make this inquiry upon a complaint from another user. If the educational
                        purpose cannot be determined you will be required to cease.
                     
                     
                     • You will be asked to leave the lab if you cannot comply with these guidelines. All
                        incidents are logged and may be reported to the Dean of Student Conduct for further
                        disciplinary action.
