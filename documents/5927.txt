                        The Peter I. Neathery Fellowship may be awarded competitively each year to up to four qualified graduate students.
                        
                        
                        The Information Assurance Scholarship Program offers full-ride funding to qualified students in return for serving the Department
                           of Defense after graduation. U.S. citizenship is required.
                        
                        
                        Graduate Assistantships are offered by the Department to a limited number of graduate students. Graduate
                           assistants work a total of 20 hours per week to support departmental teaching, lab,
                           and other needs. The appointment provides a stipend and tuition & fee waiver for the
                           academic year, but it does not include summer support. To be considered for a graduate
                           assistantship, your graduate program application must be received by the end of February
                           for the Fall semester, or the end of November for Spring.
                        
                        
                        Research Assistantships are available through research faculty and are supported by external grants. They
                           provide stipends and waivers comparable to those from Graduate Assistantships, but
                           duties depend on specific research projects. Please contact individual faculty for further information.
