                     Exploring the experience of the Jewish people.
                     
                     Bornblum Judaic Studies explores the experience of the Jewish people within the contexts
                        of world cultures. Non-theological in its orientation, it provides students the opportunity
                        to study the history of the Jewish people, the Hebrew language, the religious, intellectual
                        and aesthetic traditions of the Jewish people, and structures and politics of Jewish
                        communities.
                     
                     
                     In addition, to providing students with intensive study in one of the world's great
                        intellectual traditions, a major or minor in Judaic Studies will also be useful to
                        students who wish to teach, to pursue careers in social or communal services, to enter
                        seminary, to prepare for graduate study in various fields, or to pursue international studies .
                     
                     
                     Mission
                     
                     The mission of Bornblum Judaic Studies is to provide students with a knowledge of
                        Judaica and to prepare students majoring in Judaic Studies for careers in Jewish education,
                        Jewish community service, graduate studies, and other areas, as well as to pursue
                        research programs contributing to a variety of areas of learning in Judaic studies.
