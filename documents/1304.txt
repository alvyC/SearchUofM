                        Visit the University of Memphis
The Office of Recruitment and Orientation Services welcomes group visits for 10 or more individuals.  Students must be in the 7th grade or higher to visit the campus.  We ask that you provide at least one chaperone for every 20 students in your group.
Reservations are required .  Only one group tour is conducted per weekday.  We cannot guarantee your preferred date, so please try to schedule your visit at least two weeks in advance.    
Your visit will consist of a walking tour that will last between 1 and 1 ½ hours.  Tours are conducted rain or shine so please dress appropriately. Please remember this is a WALKING TOUR . Wear comfortable shoes and dress appropriately.  If you are unable to walk for the duration of the tour, please reconsider attending the tour. 
Accommodations cannot be made for any group tour members unable to walk.  Visitors with special needs must provide their own accommodations for the tour. Chaperones are responsible for the conduct of each student participating in a tour.  University of Memphis staff and tour guides reserve the right to end a tour due to inappropriate behavior, inappropriate language, or gross misconduct.
