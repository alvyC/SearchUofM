                     April 21 Gala Will Highlight Contributions of African-American Men
                     
                     March 9, 2016 - The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change will honor West
                        Tennessee native Marvin R. Ellison, CEO of JCPenney, at the Institute's annual "Join
                        Hands for Change" gala on April 21. The gala's theme, "Empowering, Supporting and
                        Celebrating African American Men: Triumph through Perseverance," highlights the contributions
                        of men such as Ellison, a UofM alumnus who has achieved significant personal and professional
                        success. The gala will also highlight the Hooks Institute's innovative programs that
                        are intended to help eliminate racial, educational, economic and other disparities
                        in the Mid-South, such as the Hooks African-American Male Initiative, a program that
                        focuses on increasing the retention and graduation of African-American students at
                        the UofM.
                     
                     
                     "As a University of Memphis alumnus, I couldn't be more proud of the mission that
                        the Hooks Institute is leading, and I am truly humbled to be honored at this year's
                        gala," said Ellison. "I believe hard work, strong faith in God and a commitment to
                        education are keys to achieving the success one desires in life. I hope my story can
                        serve as an inspiration to others and help shine a light on the important work the
                        Institute is doing to increase the retention and graduation rates of African-American
                        males attending the University of Memphis."
                     
                     
                     The gala will begin at 7 p.m. at the UofM Holiday Inn, 3700 Central Ave. Tickets may
                        be purchased online from Eventbrite at memphis.edu/benhooks . For sponsorship information or for additional information about this event, contact

                     Ellison has nearly 30 years of experience in the retail industry. Prior to joining
                        JCPenney in 2014, he spent 12 years at Home Depot, where he rose to become executive
                        vice president of retail stores. Before joining Home Depot, Ellison spent 15 years
                        with Target in a variety of operational roles, including corporate director of asset
                        protection.
                     
                     
                     Ellison is actively involved in philanthropic efforts, including inner-city school
                        renovations, as well as mentoring programs aimed at developing inner-city youth. He
                        earned a business administration degree in marketing from the UofM and a master of
                        business administration degree from Emory University. Ellison's wife, Sharyn, is also
                        a graduate of the UofM.
                     
                     
                     In 1996, UofM officials received approval from the Tennessee Board of Regents to create
                        the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change in the College of Arts & Sciences.
                        The mission of the Institute is teaching, studying and promoting civil rights and
                        social change. The Hooks Institute archives include Hooks' personal papers, which
                        are housed in the Mississippi Valley Collection in the University's McWherter Library.
