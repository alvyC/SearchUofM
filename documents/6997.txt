                          How do I obtain a computer account?
                           
                           In order to obtain a university email account, you have to initialize your account
                              here . The university utilizes a single sign-on (SSO) system for access to many university
                              accounts. SSO allows access control to multiple independent software systems with
                              the same user login credentials. However, because we use this SSO system, it is even
                              more important to protect the integrity of your account password. Your SSO credentials
                              will allow for access to hundreds of TigerLan computers in labs scattered across campus--many
                              of these labs are open 24/7. Find a computer lab with the university's Technology Resource Locator .
                           
                           
                           Here is a website detailing the conditions of a strong password, as well as providing
                              a random strong password generator.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                          How do I obtain an High Performance Computing (HPC) Facility computer account?
                           
                           Please have your advisor send an email to hpcadmins@memphis.edu stating the request for an HPC account with your full name and uuid.

                           Use a VPN connection to access on-campus computers and software from off campus.
                           
                           
                           UM also supports vmware ( umWare ) for access to software applications. umWare provides users with access to the software available on TigerLan computers. This
                              software can be used from anywhere on or off campus and is available for both Windows
                              PCs and Macs. Your work is saved to your own computer and you can print locally. All
                              you need is a computer, an internet connection, and your uuid/password.

                          My computer is not working. How do I get it working or worked on?
                           
                           First fully power down your machine; then restart your machine. A simple "restart"
                              of your computer is not the same as a full "shutdown".
                           
                           
                           Restart your computer in "Safe Mode" by pressing F8 at the BIOS splash screen, right after the computer is started, and selecting "Safe
                              Mode" from the menu. Correct the problem, and reboot normally.
                           
                           
                           If there is a serious hardware problem, submit an UM Helpdesk Ticket here . Please describe the issue explicitly in your UM Helpdesk ticket.For software issues
                              and minor hardware issues, UM Chemistry faculty, staff, and students that are on-campus
                              can contact Dr. DeYonker .

                           Is there vendor support? If so, contact the vendor. Is this software installed on
                              a machine at the HPC facility? If so, contact hpcadmins@memphis.edu and provide details about your issue.

                           Check the ethernet cable and its connection to the router, switch, or wall. Reboot
                              your computer. Check the network connection: Start-->Settings-->Network Connections.
                              Check the "status" and "repair" the connection.
