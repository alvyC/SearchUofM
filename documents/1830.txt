                     Crews Center Startup Feather Reaches Funding Milestone
                     
                     March 1, 2016- Feather, a mobile marketplace that helps families find, hire and coordinate
                        in-home senior care, has reached a major funding milestone.
                     
                     
                     Feather, which has been working out of the Crews Center for Entrepreneurship since
                        September 2015, has raised $250,000 in cash and services from Hayseed Ventures, a
                        venture capital firm based in Fayetteville, Ark. Hayseed is led by Dr. John James,
                        who founded the successful startup Acumen Brands, which focuses on the online retail
                        business-to-consumer market.
                     
                     
                     Families can use Feather to connect with qualified and compatible caregivers. They
                        also can use Feather's web and mobile app to schedule appointments, check in on their
                        loved one, and even chat with their caregiver.  
                     
                     
                     The company was founded by University of Memphis alumni Rachel Fuller and Nick Fuller,
                        current UofM computer science student Evan Black, and Christopher Williams. The team
                        has since expanded to include UofM alumna Shannon Kelly and current UofM student Kieran
                        Blazier.
                     
                     
                     Crews Center director Mike Hoffmeyer mentored Feather through its fundraising process.
                        "The University of Memphis is committed to encouraging and supporting our students
                        as they progress in their entrepreneurial journey," he said. "This funding is a major
                        milestone for Feather as they continue to penetrate the senior care market."
                     
                     
                     Feather currently offers services in Memphis and Nashville, and will be expanding
                        to Little Rock and Northwest Arkansas in March. As part of its partnership with Hayseed
                        Ventures, Rachel and Nick Fuller and Williams have moved operations to Fayetteville
                        to leverage their strategic investment and to scale their operation and optimize service
                        delivery to seniors and families. Feather's development team (Black, Blazier and Kelly)
                        will remain at the Crews Center for Entrepreneurship.
