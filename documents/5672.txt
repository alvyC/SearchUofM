                     UofM Law Professor Daniel Kiel Receives Fulbright Award
                     
                     August 13, 2015 - Daniel Kiel, associate professor of law at the University of Memphis,
                        has been awarded a Fulbright Scholar grant for research at the University of the Free
                        State in Bloemfontein, South Africa, during the fall 2015 semester.
                     
                     
                     Kiel's research project is titled "Comparative Analysis of Educational Remedies in
                        Destratifying Societies." The fellowship will allow him to expand his research on
                        American educational law and disparities in the South African context. His research
                        will involve comparing the post-apartheid South African experience confronting educational
                        inequities with the decades-long experience following the Brown v. Board of Education
                        decision in the United States. The similarity to Memphis, given local demographics
                        and persistent racial issues, made the choice of South Africa a particularly compelling
                        choice for Kiel.
                     
                     
                     Kiel is one of approximately 1,100 U.S. faculty and professionals who will travel
                        abroad through the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program in 2015-2016. The program is administered
                        by the Council for International Exchange of Scholars, a division of the Institute
                        of International Education.
                     
                     
                     The Fulbright Program is the flagship of the international educational exchange program
                        sponsored by the U.S. government and is designed to increase mutual understanding
                        between the people of the United States and the people of other countries. The primary
                        source of funding for the Fulbright Program is an annual appropriation made by the
                        U.S. Congress to the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural
                        Affairs. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations and foundations
                        in foreign countries and in the United States also provide direct and indirect support.
                        The program operates in more than 155 countries worldwide.
