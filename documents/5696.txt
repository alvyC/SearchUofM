                     Chiego, who joined the UofM faculty in 1979, is a professor of double bass. He has
                        been an active performer his entire career serving in positions such as principal

                        Brevard Music Center, Allegheny Summer Music Festival, Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp and
                        the Tennessee Governor's School for the Arts before joining the faculty of the National
                        Music Festival.
                     
                     
                     "I'm thrilled that Professor Chiego has accepted our offer to lead the Rudi E. Scheidt
                        School of Music," said UofM President M. David Rudd. "We have great confidence in
                        his ability to lead the school in the coming years, build on a solid foundation and
                        achieve national and international recognition for a remarkably talented group of
                        faculty and students. The Scheidt School of Music is one of the true gems at the University
                        of Memphis."
                     
                     
                     UofM Provost Karen Weddle-West said, "I am tremendously impressed with John Chiego's
                        knowledge and understanding of the budget model, strategies to maximize resources
                        during the SRI (Strategic Resources Investment) transition, his awareness of and appreciation
                        for the University's culture, and his vision to enhance the national and international
                        recognition of the high-quality scholarly/creative productivity among the faculty
                        and students in the Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music. His leadership will be an asset
                        to the College of Communication and Fine Arts and the larger community."
                     
                     
                     Chiego has been an artist-in-residence at the Bay View Chamber Music Festival and
                        toured with such artists as Amy Grant and Vince Gill. He has traveled extensively
                        throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe, with featured solo recitals at the Edinburgh
                        International Double Bass Festival and the International Society of Bassists worldwide
                        convention. He is the author of The Musical Experience, a popular textbook for introductory
                        music courses used by colleges and universities across the country.
                     
                     
                     "As the new director of the School of Music, it will be my privilege to work alongside
                        an extraordinary faculty and help bring well-deserved recognition to the already world-class
                        work they and their students do every day in the school and in the community," Chiego
                        said. "I invite music lovers of every type to join us at any of the more than 250
                        concerts we present each year to hear for themselves the quality of our students as
                        they prepare to become the next generation of performers and music educators."
