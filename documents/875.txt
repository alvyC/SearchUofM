                     Budget Development
                     
                     The draft budget must be developed using the internal budget template ( Forms ) and submitted to osp@memphis.edu along with the intent to submit, program announcement or proposal guideline information,
                        proposal submission deadline date, and if possible, the draft budget narrative.
                     
                     
                     The draft budget should be submitted 10 working days prior to the submission deadline
                        date to ensure the OSP administrator has sufficient time to review the budget for
                        accuracy and compliance with University and Sponsor policies.  If you have Subawardee(s),
                        please note that budgets cannot be finalized until a Letter of Commitment and budget
                        are received from the Subawardee(s).

                     MTDC (modified total direct costs): Indirect cost rates, in most instances, is to be applied to all budget items except
                        capital expenditures (equipment $5,000 or more per unit), tuition remission, the portion
                        of each individual subcontract in excess of $25,000, charges for patient care, rental
                        costs of off-site facilities, and scholarships and fellowships. Off-campus rate is
                        applied in cases where rent for off-campus facilities are budgeted as a direct cost.
                     
                     
                     Indirect cost rate for TN State Agencies and Local Governments: 15% of Total Direct Costs (TDC), unless
                        otherwise specified in sponsor guidelines.
                     
                     
                     When the sponsor caps the indirect cost rate and they do not specify how the rate
                        is to be applied, UofM's standard practice is to charge the capped rate to total direct
                        costs (rather than modified total direct costs, or MTDC).

                     General Purpose Supplies and Administrative Personnel Cost
                     
                     The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21 requires that certain
                        expenses be treated as indirect costs and paid for through the indirect mechanism.
                        To qualify as a direct charge on a sponsored project, costs normally considered indirect
                        costs must be charged in a timely manner and must be consistent with established institutional
                        policies and practices. To request authorization to direct charge expenditures that would normally be treated
                        as indirect costs, please complete the Unlike Circumstance Request Form. This form
                        is part of the budget template, located on the this website under Forms . The Unlike Circumstance Request form should be completed at the time of proposal
                        submission, when it is known that general purpose office supplies and/or administrative
                        personnel costs will be directly charged to a project. In some cases, when it is not
                        known at the time of submission, the form may be submitted after the award, but prior
                        to the purchase or charging of the cost directly to the project .
                     
                     The justification to direct charge administrative personnel costs that are normally treated as F&A must include the following:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                         description of how the duties performed by the administrative person are distinct
                           from their normal duties,
                        
                        
                         document how the duties will be allocated exclusively to the project to which they
                           are being charged,
                        
                        
                        describe the specific goals with the project that would not be accomplished with these
                           administrative activities, and
                        
                        
                        the administrative costs must be pre-approved by the sponsor, either in the original
                           budget narrative or separately after the award has been made.

                        description of how the item being purchased is different from the normal use of similar
                           items,
                        
                        
                        document how the item will be allocated exclusively for the use of the project to
                           which it is being charged,
                        
                        
                        describe the specific goals within the project that would not be accomplished without
                           these items, and
                        
                        
                        the items must be pre-approved by the sponsor, either in the original budget narrative
