                     UofM and City of Memphis Will Use Smart Technologies to Address Critical Challenges
                     
                     August 21, 2015 - Our cities face complex challenges involving interconnected infrastructure
                        systems such as transportation, water and sewer, communication, buildings and public
                        services. The University of Memphis and the city of Memphis have agreed to collaborate
                        on using smart technologies to find solutions to these pressing challenges.
                     
                     
                     Representatives from the city and the University will sign an agreement for the Memphis
                           Smart City Innovation Program Monday, Aug 24, at 4:30 p.m. in the FedEx Institute
                           of Technology Video Conference Room. 
                     
                     Under the Smart Cities Innovation Program, the city and the UofM will partner to pursue
                        21st century solutions to challenges confronting infrastructure, city services and
                        civic engagement. Using conventional approaches, addressing these issues would require
                        significant investment. Research universities like the UofM have the physical and
                        human resources to help their cities meet these challenges by researching, developing
                        and deploying innovative projects at a lower cost.
                     
                     
                     "Every great city needs a great university, contributing to its cultural experience,
                        economic development, innovation environment and quality of life," said UofM President
                        M. David Rudd. "Recent advances in the development of smart technologies are now opening
                        up opportunities for cities to function more efficiently and effectively in serving
                        their citizens. The University of Memphis is collaborating with the city of Memphis
                        on 'smart' projects specifically designed to help resolve some of our most difficult
                        challenges."
                     
                     
                     Brent Nair, the city's chief information officer, said, "We are excited to begin a
                        new collaborative partnership with the University of Memphis in the Smart City Innovation
                        Program. This program aligns perfectly with Mayor Wharton's priorities: create safe
                        and vibrant neighborhoods, grow prosperity and opportunity for all, invest in our
                        youth, and advance a culture of excellence in city government. One example is our
                        partnership will be with Dr. Naveen Kumar, the University's new data science professor,
                        who will be reviewing how data can be used to develop blight predictors."
