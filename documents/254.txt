	   Keep in touch with the classmates that you spent all-nighters studying
with and network with fellow alumni of a similar profession by getting
involved in an academic chapter.
Each chapter hosts events throughout the year in order to honor outstanding alumni, reconnect with friends, show appreciation for faculty and staff members, raise money for scholarships, or give back to the community. Show your support by attending an event!
Academic chapters rely on the support of alumni and friends to plan events and advance the chapter toward achieving its goals. You can help by volunteering to serve on a governing board or by attending meetings and sharing your ideas. To learn more, select a chapter name to the left and contact the Alumni Coordinator.
Have an idea for an academic chapter? Contact alumniassociation@memphis.edu or 901.678.2586.
