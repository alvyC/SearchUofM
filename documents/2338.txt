                     Courses provide students an opportunity to study plants and animals in both laboratory
                        and field environments. Field courses primarily have focused on animals and have included
                        extended field trips to various parts of the United States, Mexico, Trinidad, and
                        Belize.
                     
                     
                     These courses take classes to new and exotic habitats and are the experience of a
                        lifetime for many students. Students get the chance to see first-hand the ecological
                        principles that they learned in the classroom. They use state-of-the-art field techniques
                        to design and conduct experiments in classes such as General Biology and Wildlife
                        Ecology or develop their own research projects in one-on-one mentorship arrangements
                        with research faculty.
                     
                     
                     During the summer, several courses are offered which include Field Techniques in Vertebrate
                        Ecology, River and Stream Ecology, and Local Floral of Tennessee. Students comment
                        that besides being informative and enriching, courses that include extended periods
                        in the field provide them with some of the most unique and lasting memories they have
                        of their college experience. Course work is available through the Department of Biology to meet the requirements for B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees.
