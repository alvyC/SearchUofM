                     Welcome to Human Resources!
                     
                     The Department of Human Resources exists to support the University's mission of teaching,
                        research and community involvement. We are a committed workforce that maintains a
                        diverse body of dedicated faculty and staff who promote the University's core values.
                        We serve as business partners for the University community by consistently championing
                        relevant and meaningful HR issues that address the growing needs of our dynamic institution.
                     
                     
                     Human Resources will encourage innovation and initiative on HR policies, processes
                        and practices in order to deliver a timely and creative approach to leading a diverse
                        and engaged workforce. We will serve as leaders in the Memphis community and be known
                        as one of American's Great Metropolitan Research Universities.
