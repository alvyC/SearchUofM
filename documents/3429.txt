                     The SSP UMentor Program is an undergraduate mentorship program which links freshman
                        SSP participants with SSP student leader mentors in order to enable students to develop
                        life and career skills through the guidance of seasoned participants. Mentoring allows
                        the student to learn about student life, career paths, networking, organizational
                        cultures, business functions and industries. Participants receive constructive feedback
                        about career goals, career building, personal skills and business skills.
