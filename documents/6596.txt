                        About Dr. McKenna
                        
                        I came to the University of Memphis in 2010 from a Ph.D. (Organismic and Evolutionary
                           Biology) and Postdoc at Harvard University I am an insect systematist and evolutionary
                           biologist. My taxonomic specialty is beetles (order Coleoptera; ~400,000 described
                           species), particularly the Phytophaga, a huge clade containing ~140,000 species, comprised
                           of the weevils, leaf beetles, longhorned beetles, and relatives, most of which feed
                           on plants. My research employs large-scale molecular data sets, and information from
                           museum specimens and field studies, to reconstruct relationships and timing and patterns
                           of ecological and taxonomic diversification, with a focus on the evolution of beetle-plant
                           interactions and phytophagy (plant-feeding). I am a member of the Insect 5000 Genomes
                           (i5k) Pilot Project, through which I lead the Asian longhorned beetle genome project,
                           and I am a collaborator on the 1,000 Insect Transcriptome Evolution (1KITE) Project.
                           I am the PI on a 3-year US National Science Foundation grant (the 1K Weevils Project)
                           which seeks to reconstruct the phylogeny of family Curculionidae (true weevils), using
                           phylogenomic and morphological data. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the
                           Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Memphis, a faculty Associate
                           of the Program in Bioinformatics and the Feinstone Center for Genomics at the University
                           of Memphis, and a Research Associate in Entomology at the Harvard University Museum
                           of Comparative Zoology. I currently teach courses in Entomology (Biological Sciences
                           4900/6900) and Evolution (Biological Sciences 4100/6100).
