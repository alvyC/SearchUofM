                        diaspora of African peoples; (b) critique the experiences of African and African American
                        women within the context of the collective experiences of Africans and African Americans
                        and the world as a whole; (c) apply methodological approaches and analytical skills
                        used in the humanities, the social and behavioral sciences, or the arts to the study
                        of the experiences of Africans and people of African descent in the Diaspora; (d)
                        demonstrate an understanding of the links between African cultural institutions and
                        those of people of African descent in the Diaspora; (e) compare and contrast the history
                        and cultures of peoples of Africa to the history and cultures of peoples of African
                        descent in the Diaspora. A. University General Education Program (41 hours)
