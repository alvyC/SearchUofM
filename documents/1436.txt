                        women within the context of the collective experiences of Africans and African Americans
                        and the world as a whole; (c) apply methodological approaches and analytical skills

                        of the experiences of Africans and people of African descent in the Diaspora; (d)
                        demonstrate an understanding of the links between African cultural institutions and
                        those of people of African descent in the Diaspora; (e) compare and contrast the history
                        and cultures of peoples of Africa to the history and cultures of peoples of African
