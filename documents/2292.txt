                     PhD in COMM
                     
                     The PhD program trains students mainly for careers in higher education, though some
                        COMM PhDs have also gone on to work in positions outside of academia. The program
                        is marked by curricular flexibility and a commitment to supporting students as they
                        work to become leaders in the field. Under close faculty supervision, students take
                        courses within Communication and in other disciplines as they build expertise in an
                        area of specialization and prepare their dissertation.

                     Program Basics
                     
                     Upon admission to the Doctoral program, students are advised by the Graduate Studies
                        Coordinator until they choose a major advisor, convene a committee, and submit a Plan
                        of Study for approval. Students work closely with their advisory committee to form
                        a plan appropriate to the student's scholarly goals. The plan spells out the student's
                        area of research emphasis, describes a dissertation topic, lists the courses that
                        s/he will take, and offers a timetable for completion.
                     
                     
                     Students must complete 36 hours of doctoral-level coursework (12 classes) before moving
                        on to their comprehensive examinations, which are administered by the advisory committee
                        and tailored to the student's research interests. Upon successful completion of their
                        exams, students submit their dissertation prospectus for committee approval. Upon
                        approval of the prospectus, students begin writing their dissertation. Students earn
                        the doctorate once their dissertation is approved by the full committee and the Graduate
                        School.
                     
                     
                     Full-time students typically spend two years in coursework, one year taking exams
                        and drafting their prospectus, and one year writing the dissertation. Obviously, this
                        varies depending on the student's success in moving through each stage of the program.
