                     Bashir Morshed, Ph.D., a recipient of the prestigious Canadian Commonwealth Scholarship,
                     is currently a faculty member of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
                     at Herff College of Engineering of the University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, and Director
                     of Embedded Systems Advanced Research and Prototyping (ESARP) lab. Dr. Morshed has
                     completed B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering
                     and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2001. He then moved to Canada to complete
                     M.A.Sc. in 2004, at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the University
                     of Windsor, Windsor, Canada. He earned Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
                     from the Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada in 2010 with
                     biomedical concentration. He was a post-doctoral fellow working on interdisciplinary
                     medical device related research at the Medical Devices Innovation Institute (MDI2)
                     of the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada till 2011. He also worked as a part-time
                     faculty at Algonquin College, Ottawa, Canada from 2009 to 2011. He is a member of
                     The University of Memphis faculty since 2011. His primary research area is embedded
                     systems with applications focused towards biomedical devices. His research aims to
                     resolve challenges at the interface of cyber and physical entities towards the next-generation
                     Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
                     
                     Dr. Morshed's current research projects include:
                     
                     1) Wireless, Integrated, Implantable, Integrated and Self-Powered Embedded Device for
                           Neuronal Sensing and Stimulation Intracortical sensing and stimulation of neurons can provide insight of functionality
                        and reorganization of cortical interconnects, and can essentially be vital tools to
                        treat Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, and many other neuronal disorders. The project aims
                        to develop a wireless, miniature, integrated and self-powered neuronal sensor and
                        ICMS for in vivo applications and being pursued in collaboration with Dr. Kozma, CS.
                     
                     
                     2) Co-analysis of EEG and HRV using Embedded Miniature Wireless Sensors to Develop Personalized
                           Instructions for Children with Developmental Delays Children with developmental delays respond in significantly unique manner to common
                        instruction modes. This is extra challenging to determine for children who have certain
                        developmental delays such as autism, cerebral palsy or other delays that make it difficult
                        to observe typical responses. By using miniature, customized, wireless embedded sensors
                        to record EEG and HRV signals and co-analysis of the responses, we expect to develop
                        highly effective personalized instruction plans and classroom curriculum for children
                        with development delays. The project is being pursued in collaboration with Special
                        Kids & Families (SKF).
                     
                     
                     3) Cyber-physical System (CPS) Development for Sensing and Tactile Actuation for Persons
                           with Severe Visual Impairment This project aims to develop a CPS system for persons with severe visual impairments
                        using embedded systems by integrating knowledge of a number of disciplines including
                        biological science, sensor technology, embedded systems, low-power wireless technology,
                        mobile and cloud computing, data mining, context aware semantic computation, and compressive
                        sensing. The project collaborator is Dr. Yeasin, EECE.
                     
                     
                     4) Electrical Impulses for Directional Growth Neurons on a Chip Neuronal growth patterns and directionality control with electrical impulses on a
                        chip surface based on aerogel substrate is investigated in collaboration with Dr.
                        Sabri, Physics.
                     
                     
                     5) Analysis of Single Molecule DNA Sequencing Using a CNT This project investigates the feasibility of a novel structure based on CNT and active
                        enzyme to sequence single molecule DNA. The project collaborator is Dr. Mussivand,
                        University of Ottawa, Canada.
