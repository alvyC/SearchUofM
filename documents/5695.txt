                     The Church Health Center opened in 1987 with a commitment to provide primary health
                        care to low-income, uninsured working people. CHC provides health care to more than
                        65,000 patients in its clinic, which includes primary care, dentistry, optometry,
                        counseling and social work services. The Center also has created the Wellness and
                        Faith Community Outreach ministries, which combine the disease prevention of medicine
                        with the spiritual care of the faith community. Morris is a physician and an ordained
                        United Methodist minister.
