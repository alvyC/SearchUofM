                     Program Overview
                     
                     The Philosophy Department inaugurated a PhD program in the Fall of 1990, in preparation
                        for the increased demand for university and college professors. The PhD program complements
                        an active MA program, which has been in place since 1968, and an expanding undergraduate
                        program, which has nearly 100 majors.
                     
                     
                     The program is designed to address a felt need in the profession of philosophy for
                        scholars able to transcend the confines of a specialty. In their research, members
                        of the department address major issues of both Anglo-American and continental philosophy
                        as well as scholarly issues concerning major figures of the history of philosophy.
                        This diversity is coupled with a unique spirit of cooperation throughout the faculty.
                     
                     
                     The course of study of graduate students is designed to take advantage of this breadth
                        and attitude of cooperation. Each student receives a thorough grounding in the history
                        of philosophy and familiarity with both the contemporary analytic and continental
                        traditions, in order to achieve an understanding of the place of his or her areas
                        of research within the several basic areas and methodologies of philosophy and the
                        historical tradition on which they are based.
                     
                     
                     Specializations are available, supported in each case by several members of the department,
                        in most areas of analytic and continental philosophy and the history of philosophy,
                        as well as on topics and issues that cross traditional boundaries.
                     
                     
                     Seminars are small, and students receive individual attention, often from several
                        members of the department with overlapping research interests. The atmosphere in the
                        department is congenial. There are many informal opportunities for ongoing philosophical
                        discussion among students and faculty away from the classroom.
                     
                     
                     PhD Program Structure
                     
                     The PhD program is structured to provide a broad background in the history of philosophy
                        and in the different contemporary methodologies, and then to proceed to the specialization
                        requisite for the dissertation. It is designed to avoid a premature and overly narrow
                        specialization and to ensure a competence in the basic fields of philosophy as a foundation
                        for subsequent concentration in one or more areas of continental philosophy, analytic
                        philosophy or the history of philosophy. Graduates will thus be prepared to teach
                        not only their specialty, but also a wide variety of basic courses, and will be prepared
                        to function effectively as teachers and colleagues even in departments in which the
                        main focus is in a tradition or methodology different from their own concentration.
                        They will also be able to apply their expertise to areas of endeavor outside academia,
                        such as law, publishing, medicine, computer design, theology, and secondary education.
                     
                     
                     Students whose objective is a PhD in philosophy at the University of Memphis and who
                        satisfy the admission requirements should apply directly to the PhD program. Applicants
                        not admitted to the PhD program because of lack of space will be considered for the
                        MA program if they indicate their desire to be so considered by marking MA/PhD on
                        their application and letter of recommendation forms. (Students in the MA program
                        may apply for admission to the PhD program).
