                     Cadet Field Training at West Point
                     
                       
                     
                     Cadet Field Training (CFT) is a 4-week event conducted at West Point during their
                        Cadet Summer Training (CST) Cycle. The purpose of CFT is to integrate ROTC Cadets
                        into the West Point Corps of Cadets during CST, where they will train on Individual
                        and collective small unit tasks. Only contracted Cadets are eligible to attend CFT.
                     
                     
                     The benefit of this program is two-fold. One, this is an incredible training opportunity
                        for less experienced ROTC Cadets to fully immerse themselves into Army training and
                        operations for an extended period of time. Two, this is a great opportunity to integrate
                        ROTC and West Point Cadets before they are commissioned together into the officer
                        corps.
                     
                     
                     Each summer approximately 130 ROTC Cadets are integrated into the Corps of Cadets
                        for this event at about a rate of 1 ROTC Cadet per Corps of Cadets Platoon. The ROTC
                        Cadets chosen to participate in CFT are representatives of Cadet Command to the United
                        States Military Academy (USMA) and should reflect the highest standards of ROTC.
