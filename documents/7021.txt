                     Admission Procedures
                     
                     For admission into a degree program, applicants should allow a reasonable amount of
                        time for necessary documents to be processed by the appropriate degree program and
                        Graduate Admissions (approximately three to six weeks) . International applicants should allow at least four months for the application process.
                        Applicants are urged to apply early to ensure full consideration.
                     
                     
                     All determinations concerning the classification of a student as in-state or out-of-state
                        for fee purposes are made in the Graduate Admissions office. If, for any reason, there
                        is a question about a state residency classification, the student is responsible for
                        requesting a review of his/her residency status BEFORE classes begin. Complete an
                        Application for Residency Classification and submit it to Graduate Admissions (FedEx
                        Institute of Technology Building, Suite 201) for review.

                     All admission credentials become the property of the University and will not be forwarded
                        or returned. Credentials will be maintained in active files for 12 months, after which
                        they will be destroyed.
                     
                     
                     Steps for applying:
                     
                     
                        
                        First view departmental information about admission requirements, test score requirements,
                           application deadlines, etc. Some departments may also require a separate admissions
                           application and may have an earlier application deadline.
                        
                        
                        Use our electronic admission applications to apply to Graduate School, file for readmission or to change your current degree
                           program or student level. (Application fees for initial admission are $35 application
                           fee for domestic students and $60 for international students).
                        
                        
                        All college transcripts and test score information should also be sent directly to
                           Graduate Admissions. Beginning with Summer and Fall 2013 admittance, the following
                           programs require the ETS® Personal Potential Index (PPI) Evaluation Report containing
                           a minimum of three (3) evaluations from separate evaluators in order to consider your
                           application complete. The PPI is a third-party evaluative tool administered by the
                           ETS (Educational Testing Service) organization. There is no fee to submit the PPI report to the University of Memphis. See the PPI Steps page for more information. You can create an ETS PPI account and review the ETS PPI Information
                           Bulletin, which explains the service, at http://www.ets.org/ppi/applicants/start/ .
                           
                           
                              
                              The PPI is required for the following programs: The Master of Arts, Master of Fine Arts, and Doctoral programs in the Department of
                                 English The Master of Science and Ph.D. programs in the Herff College of Engineering
                              
                              
                              The PPI is highly recommended for the following programs: The Master of Arts program in Public and Non-Profit Administration The Master of Science and Ed.D. programs in Counseling
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        Applicants whose highest degree is from a foreign institution must have their credentials
                           evaluated by any credentialing agency listed on the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services web site . Course-to-course evaluation is required. If the program to which you are applying
                           requires letters of recommendation, those letters should be sent directly to the department.
                        
                        
                        Once your application and application fee have been received, all pertinent data will
                           be entered into a central database. At that time, Graduate Admissions will send confirmation
                           of the receipt of your application.
                        
                        
                        After all pertinent admissions information (test scores and transcripts) is received
                           by Graduate Admissions, your record will be forwarded to the respective department
                           for evaluation.

                        If the department decides to recommend your admission, Graduate Admissions will be
                           notified. Subsequently, you may hear from the department regarding their recommendation
                           of admission before you hear from Graduate Admissions regarding final admission.
                        
                        
                        Graduate Admissions will send official letters of admission.
                        
                        For international applicants, the I-20 or IAP-66 needed to secure an F-1 or J-1 visa
