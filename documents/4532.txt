                     Dear Campus Community:

                        to exceed last year's numbers following summer graduation (2014-2015). I will share

                        making solid gains. Our total graduation numbers have increased from 3,999 in 2011-12
                        to 4,311 in 2013-2014, an increase of 7.8%. If you look at undergraduate degrees granted,
                        we improved from 2,727 to 2,991, a remarkable 9.6% increase over two years. As you
                        know, these totals represent far more than can be communicated in a line graph. The
                        number of lives changed is nothing short of extraordinary. Thank you for engaging
                        in the important work of helping our students complete their degrees.
                     
                     
                     Over the past few months, we have received several gifts to support the U of M Finish
                        Line Program. As of this week, 101 students have already completed their degrees through
                        Finish Line, with another 115 expected to graduate in December. As shared a few weeks
                        ago, our summer initiatives have also been effective, with an increase in summer enrollment
                        for the first time in three years, and a significant increase in the number of first-time
                        freshman taking summer courses at the U of M.
                     
                     
                     I know that many have had questions about the impact of Tennessee Promise, with the
                        expectation that it may well result in a decline in freshman enrollment at TBR universities,
                        coupled with a marked increase in community college numbers. As of this week, our
                        student orientation numbers exceed those of last year by about 11%. As you know, last
                        year's freshman class represented an increase over the previous year of 11.6%. Given
                        the range of new variables this year (e.g. Tennessee Promise, new private housing
                        options around campus) it's difficult to be precise in our predictions. Some of our
                        colleagues are predicting rather sizable declines in freshman numbers. Given the full
                        range of data available, we are projecting some positive increase in freshman enrollment,
                        with the worst case scenario suggesting flat enrollment (consistent with last year's
                        numbers). I'll keep you updated as more definitive data becomes available. As we look
                        at overall university enrollment, it is important to keep in mind that, prior to last
                        year, we experienced two years of significant decline in freshman enrollment. Coupled
                        with the increases in our graduation numbers, it will take several years to grow as
                        an institution. The gains in freshman enrollment will be offset by smaller 3rd, 4th,
                        5th, and 6th year classes, secondary to the issues noted.
                     
                     
                     Thank you for your dedication and commitment to the U of M and Memphis. Go Tigers!
