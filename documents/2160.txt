                        In each of these, the partner must be actively engaged including meeting with students
                        and participating in design juries. Often, multiple sections of design studios are
                        integrated so that each community partner (and the students) has the advantage of
                        at least two faculty members involved. This collaborative model exposes students to
                        a more realistic, practice-based situation similar to what they will find in the professional
                        workplace after graduation.
                     
                     
                     Community Engagement Partners (past several years)
                     
                     TERRA Demonstration House (LEED Platinum): At least 50 community partners, especially the Henry Turley Company, City of Memphis,
                        MLGW, and DPC Construction, were involved in this over the seven semesters of design
                        and construction and several have continued to work with us on post-occupancy monitoring.
