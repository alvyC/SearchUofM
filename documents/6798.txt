                     and target individual consumers with tailored ads. Consumer data are among the most
                     valuable assets that firms own. An interesting phenomenon is that competing firms
                     often trade their consumer data with each other. Based on a common-value all-pay auction
                     framework, this paper studies the advertising competition between two firms that target
                     the same consumer but are asymmetrically informed about the consumer value. We characterize
                     firms' equilibrium competition strategies. The results show that better consumer information
                     does not help the better-informed firm save the advertising expenditure but does enable
                     it to reap a higher expected profit in competition. Sharing individual-level consumer
                     data may soften the competition even though firms compete head-to-head for the same
                     consumer. We also find that the better-informed firm may sell its data to its competitor
                     but never voluntarily shares it with its competitor.
