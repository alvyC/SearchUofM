                        About Dr. Paul Simone
                        
                        Dr. Paul S. Simone, Jr. is an assistant professor of chemistry at The University of
                           Memphis, where he earned his B.S. Ch., M.S. and Ph.D., and started his career as an
                           tenure-track professor at The Citadel in Charleston, SC. Dr. Simone works at the nexus
                           of research and business, developing new technologies at The University of Memphis
                           to help drinking water utilities comply with ever stricter USEPA regulations of drinking
                           water disinfection by-products. The new technologies are protected through patents
                           and subsequently commercialized through Foundation Instruments, Inc. Foundation Instruments
                           was co-founded with Gary L. Emmert and Wei Wu-Emmert, and is a high-tech, small business
                           spun out from The University of Memphis.

                        Research and Scholarly Activities
                        
                        Broadly, Dr. Simone's research interests are in trace analysis of regulated chemical
                           species in environmental samples which are at the nexus of Research, Business and
                           Regulations. More specifically, Dr. Simone is interested in development and commercialization
                           of new, fully-automated chemical analysis systems for two classes of chemical carcinogens,
                           the trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) regulated by the USEPA in finished
                           drinking water. These new chemical analysis systems handle all sampling handling,
                           chemical analysis, and reporting of concentrations.
