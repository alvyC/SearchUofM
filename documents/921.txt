                     All university fees and charges are calculated and assessed consistent with policies
                        and procedures of the Tennessee Board of Regents and The University of Memphis. The
                        listing of any fee or incidental charge in this catalog does not constitute a contract
                        between the University and the student. Because of rapidly changing conditions, it
                        may be necessary to alter a fee structure before the next edition of the catalog is
                        published. As a condition of registration, each student will pay the fees in effect
                        for the semester for which he or she registers. The University will usually collect
                        the amount of fees due at the time of registration each semester in accordance with
                        the residency classification and fee rates in effect. After all enrollments are complete,
                        any over-collections will be refunded and students will be billed for any under-collections.
