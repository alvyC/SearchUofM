The University of Memphis Moving Allowance POLICIES

Issued:  June 5, 2014 Responsible Official:  Vice President for Business & Finance Responsible Office:  Accounting Office Purpose   Payment of a moving allowance must be approved in advance by the President or designee.
Approval of a moving allowance may be made when considered in the interest of the University and when such payment is a part of the employment negotiation with a new employee or the relocation of a current employee.  This procedure applies to a moving allowance paid by The University of Memphis, including Restricted Funds and Auxiliary Funds.
An allowance as provided in these regulations shall not be allowed unless and until the employee agrees in writing to remain employed with the University as a full-time employee for a period of twelve (12) months following the effective date of the move, unless separated for reasons beyond the employee's control and acceptable to the University. The service agreement statement should be maintained in the employee's personnel file.  In case of a violation of such an agreement, including failure to effect the transfer, any allowances shall be recoverable from the employee concerned, as a debt due the University.   This policy has been established to effectively implement procedures to comply with the Tennessee Board of Regents' Moving Allowance policy related to moving expenses.     Contents Definitions Employees Procedures Authorization I.
