                     Private gifts are increasingly important to maintain a quality program in Political
                        Science. Support from alumni, family and friends will make a difference in academic
                        opportunities we can offer to our students and faculty. Our funding needs include
                        the following:
                     
                     
                     Political Science Enrichment Fund
                     
                     We will use these funds to provide additional opportunities for our students, such
                        as research travel funds and additional undergraduate and graduate scholarship support.
                        These funds will also help us attract and retain high-caliber faculty members through
                        such things as supplementing research travel or the purchase of specialized data sets
                        or computer software.
                     
                     
                     Gary Carman Memorial Fund
                     
                     The Gary Carman Merit Award was established to honor the memory of Gary Carman. Gary
                        placed great importance upon serving the department and the university, and was widely
                        known for his friendliness and his willingness to help wherever and whenever needed.
                        He viewed students, faculty and staff as part of his extended family. In 2007, he
                        passed away after an intense struggle with cancer and the department decided to pay
                        tribute to him by creating an award that recognizes a student, who demonstrates a
                        strong commitment to excellence in service to the Department of Political Science
                        and The University of Memphis. The long-term goal of the department is to endow this
                        fund.
                     
                     
                     Mock Trial Team Fund
                     
                     We will use these funds to provide travel support for our Mock Trial Team to compete
                        in national tournaments. Members of our Mock Trial Team have gained invaluable experience
                        by competing against strong national competition and participation of our students
                        in this program will help prepare them for careers in the field of law.
