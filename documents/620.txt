                     ACADEMIC CURRICULUM
                     
                     Memphis Law offers both a full-time day program and a part-time day program. The part-time
                        program is for a limited number of students whose other responsibilities make full-time
                        study difficult. Our curriculum is designed to challenge students and prepare them
                        for the practice of law. The curriculum reflects a commitment to traditional legal
                        education with the emphasis on fundamental lawyering skills and core areas of knowledge.
                     
                     
                     Memphis Law operates on the semester system and requires 90 semester hours for the
                        J.D. degree. A full-time student is required to enroll in at least 12 hours each semester.
                        Students in the full-time program normally graduate in three years. Summer classes
                        are sometimes available and students can graduate after five semesters and two summer
                        sessions of full-time study.
                     
                     
                     Part-time students normally will graduate in four or four-and-one-half years (including
                        summer semesters). Graduation requirements for those students enrolled in the part-time
                        program are the same as for those students enrolled in the full-time program. A part-time
                        student is required to enroll in at least eight hours, but may enroll in no more than
                        11 hours, each semester.

                     Transferred Credit Credit for law school work competed at law schools other than at The University of
                        Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law will be credited toward fulfilling graduation
                        requirements only after individual consideration by the Dean. No credit, however,
                        will be given for work completed in a United States Law School which is not ABA approved.
                        Advanced standing will be granted only for work done after the student has completed
                        a Baccalaureate degree.To be eligible for transfer, credit earned in each course considered
                        for transfer credit must be at least equal to the overall grade point average required
                        for graduation at the University of Memphis, Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law.
                     
                     
                     Determination of Credit Hours for Coursework
                     
                     Standard 310. DETERMINATION OF CREDIT HOURS FOR COURSEWORK (a) A law school shall
                        adopt, publish, and adhere to written policies and procedures for determining the
                        credit hours that it awards for coursework. (b) A "credit hour" is an amount of work
                        that reasonably approximates: (1) not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty
                        instruction and two hours of out-of-class student work per week for fifteen weeks,
                        or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or (2) at least
                        an equivalent amount of work as required in subparagraph (1) of this definition for
                        other academic activities as established by the institution, including simulation,
                        field placement, clinical, co-curricular, and other academic work leading to the award
                        of credit hours. Interpretation 310-1 For purposes of this Standard, fifty minutes
                        suffices for one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction. An "hour" for out-of-class
                        student work is sixty minutes. The fifteen-week period may include one week for a
                        final examination. Interpretation 310-2 A school may award credit hours for coursework
                        that extends over any period of time, if the coursework entails no less than the minimum
                        total amounts of classroom or direct faculty instruction and out-of-class student
                        work specified in Standard 310(b).
