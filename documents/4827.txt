                     Individualized Professional Development Plans
                     
                     Student affairs staff participate in an optional process to develop professional development
                        plans. Such plans serve as blueprints for professional development activities each
                        year. Developing these plans is a part of staff annual evaluation efforts. You can
                        review the template for this plan by going here.
