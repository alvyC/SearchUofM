                     General Information: Inorganic Chemistry is a very broad subject, encompassing many disciplines. Inorganic
                        courses at the undergraduate level are varied, some give a very lengthy discussion
                        to descriptive chemistry (traditional), some provide a rigorous introduction to physical
                        methods, while others are a mixture of these two approaches. This situation puts pressures
                        on both instructor and students to compress the study of a considerable amount of
                        material into a relatively short period of time.
                     
                     
                     Course Objectives: To provide students with an in-depth conceptual and practical understanding of various
                        topics in inorganic chemistry. To provide students with appropriate background for
                        further study in undergraduate level inorganic chemistry.

                     Grades: A comprehensive final examination will be administered in class at the assigned time.
                        At least one test will be administered in class and graded before the last day to
                        drop. Other tests, quizzes, and graded assignments, weighting, and grade ranges are
                        at the discretion of the instructor, and will be detailed on a syllabus distributed
                        on the first day of class.

                        Tardiness and unexcused absence from class are unprofessional behaviors which should
                           be avoided, but attendance will not be graded.
                        
                        
                        Electronic devices such as cell phones and pagers should be turned off in the classroom.
                        
                        Reasonable and appropriate accommodations will be made for students who present a
