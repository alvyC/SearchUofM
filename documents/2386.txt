                     Parking is available in the main Central Avenue lot on campus. You will receive a
                        parking permit in the mail once you register for E-Day. Please be sure to display
                        this hang tag in your vehicle to avoid a parking ticket. Buses will unload in front
                        of the Engineering Administration Building (labeled EA on the Campus Map) and then
                        MUST proceed to Goodlett and then Poplar Avenue to access the Conlee Lot for parking.
