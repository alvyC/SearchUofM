                     Preparing the next generation of public health leaders.
                     
                     Welcome to the University of Memphis School of Public Health, making a world of difference.
                     
                     As population increases and diseases evolve, the need for leadership in health institutions
                        also grows.  The University of Memphis School of Public Health (SPH) is preparing
                        the next generation of leaders to address public health concerns and is focused on
                        translating research into practice.  Our mission is global, but our work begins in
                        our own community.  We actively work with officials and leaders in the community to
                        take on pressing issues like HIV/AIDS, childhood obesity prevention, asthma, heart
                        disease, tobacco use and cessation, sickle cell disease, and social inequities that
                        adversely affect health.  Our students and faculty are active participants in public
                        health research and practice.  We envision change for our world while making a difference
