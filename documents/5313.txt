                     Under the Tennessee Career Mobility Plan registered nurses who have graduated from
                        Tennessee schools or out-of-state NLN accredited programs will be able to progress
                        to the baccalaureate degree in nursing without testing to verify previous nursing
                        education. Registered nurses articulating to the baccalaureate level may be awarded
                        or transfer in nursing credits equivalent to approximately one year of nursing courses.
                        For this to occur, a minimum grade of "C" must have been earned in previous nursing
                        course work. Nursing credits transferred or awarded will be held in escrow. These
                        credits will be placed on individual transcripts only after students have successfully
                        completed 15 hours of nursing courses with a minimum grade of "C" in The LoewenbergÂ College
                        of Nursing. Non nursing credits are transferred according to university policies.
                        Testing will be required for graduates of non NLN accredited programs or for students
                        who have not been in active clinical practice in the past three years.

                     Science Course Validation: If seven years have lapsed since credit was earned in BIOL
                        2010/2011 and 2020/2021 (Anatomy and Physiology), or BIOL 1230/1231 (Microbiology),
                        the content is considered outdated, and students are required to either repeat the
                        course(s) or validate currency of knowledge. Required validation of current science
                        knowledge for RNs will occur through employer verification, repeating of course, taking
                        a higher level science course in the same field, or obtaining a fiftieth (50th) percentile
                        score or above on the NLN appropriate science test.
