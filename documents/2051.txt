                     The department offers an Accelerated BS/MS degree program, with concentrations in
                        Applied Mathematics, Mathematics, and Statistics.
                        			This program allows outstanding undergraduates to complete both a Bachelor of Science
                        degree in Mathematical Sciences and a Master of Science degree in Mathematical Sciences
                        within a total of five years, as opposed to the minimum of six years normally required.
                        Students admitted into the program will follow a carefully designed program of study
                        which allows them to begin course work for the Master of Science program during their
                        senior year. Interested students are encouraged to consult with their undergraduate
                        advisor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences and to begin planning to enter
                        the accelerated BS/MS degree program early in their undergraduate career. Through
                        careful coordination with their undergraduate and graduate advisors students will
                        be able to graduate with both a bachelor's and master's degree within a five year
                        period.
                     
                     
                     		
                     To apply, students must have finished 18 credit hours of course work in mathematics
                        by the end of the semester of their application. Applicants must have a cumulative
                        GPA of 3.00 (on a 4.0 scale) as well as a GPA of 3.30 (on a 4.0 scale) in their mathematics
                        courses. The initial application for the accelerated BS/MS degree program consists
                        of the following two parts:
                     
                     
                     
                        	
                        A letter of intent including two letters of reference and a copy of the applicant's
                           transcript to be submitted to the Department of Mathematical Sciences
                        
                        	
                        Application with the Graduate School for "combination senior" status
                        
                        		
                     
                     		
                     To continue in the program beyond the bachelor's degree, students must also apply
                        for full admission into the Graduate School and be accepted into the master's program
                        by the Department of Mathematical Sciences.
                     
                     
                     
                     Up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both the undergraduate and
                        graduate programs. Details on courses that can be applied will be available in the
                        Department of Mathematical Sciences. However, any graduate course work will not be
                        used to calculate the undergraduate GPA.
