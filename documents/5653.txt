                     UofM Will Screen The Hunting Ground as Part of Critical Conversations Initiative
                     
                     September 14, 2015 - The University of Memphis will host two showcase screenings of
                        the documentary The Hunting Ground Oct. 6 at 1 and 7 p.m. at the Michael D. Rose Theatre on campus. The documentary
                        premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival and has been showing on
                        college campuses and other venues throughout the country. The UofM was selected for
                        the showcase screening, which is being underwritten by a grant secured by the filmmaker
                        and features writer/director Kirby Dick in the panel discussion following each of
                        the screenings. Dick will also be on campus throughout the morning to speak with students
                        in classes or small groups.
                     
                     
                     The engaging and provocative film offers a straightforward look at the prevalence
                        of sexual assault on college campuses, university responses to these incidents, and
                        the toll that they take on survivors. The purpose of this event is to promote honest
                        and open discussions about sexual assault, address myths and misunderstandings about
                        rape, and the elements of a comprehensive prevention and post-assault program.
                     
                     
                     This event is free and open to the public. College students from Memphis area campuses
                        are particularly encouraged to attend the screenings and a Community Resources Fair
                        from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the University Center atrium. University officials and
                        student organizations are also planning other events during the week before and after
                        the screenings to encourage students to think further about such issues as consent,
                        responsibility and the importance of active, positive bystander interventions.
                     
                     
                     The screenings are a part of a larger, campus-wide "Critical Conversations" initiative
                        which started this spring. The goal of Critical Conversations is to use collective
                        scholarship to sustain and facilitate a democratic civil society that values diversity,
                        civil rights, human rights, and nonviolent movements and initiatives.
                     
                     
                     The Hunting Ground showcase screening is sponsored by the Director of Diversity Initiatives/Office of
                        the Provost, the Center for Research on Women, the Critical Conversations Committee
                        and the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change.
