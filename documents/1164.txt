	   Known originally as West Tennessee State Normal School, the institution opened its
doors Sept. 10, 1912, with Dr. Seymour A. Mynders as president. Students in the first

holds that the colors, those of the opposing armies during the Civil War, were chosen
in commemoration of the reuniting of the country after that divisive conflict. -Continue Reading-

Tiger Traditions
Since 1912, our University has proudly sent well over 100,000 graduates into the world. These scholars have gone on to shape our community and our future, and they have each played a part in writing our history and creating our traditions. The UofM Alumni Association charges each member of our Tiger family to uphold these traditions and write your own Tiger Tale. Take those memories with you and continue to spread your Tiger Pride. Remember, wherever you are, you’re a Tiger!
