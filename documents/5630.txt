                     UofM Professors Uncover Possible Ice Age "Social Networks" With Park Service Grant
                     
                     November 2, 2015 - Ancient Ice Age American artifacts shed light on how people may
                        have lived 10,000 years ago. University of Memphis professors Ryan Parish, David Dye
                        and Ying Sing Li used funding from the National Center for Preservation Technology
                        and Training (NCPTT), a program of the National Park Service, to analyze stone spear
                        points from central Tennessee. The goal was to understand how people used stone resources
                        and adapted to the warming climate at the end of the last Ice Age.
                     
                     
                     The research team continues to develop new technologies that can identify where Native
                        Americans got their stone resources on the landscape. The current study shows that
                        three groups of hunter-gatherers from southern Illinois, northern Alabama and central
                        Tennessee congregated at camp sites along the Tennessee River near modern-day Savannah,
                        Tenn. The periodic assembling of dispersed groups would have been important as the
                        exchange of information regarding ever-shifting resources minimized risk. The spectroscopy
                        techniques used in the study are non-destructive and provided a method to source the
                        stone used to manufacture the spear points back to where the material outcrops, allowing
                        the researchers to track their movements.
