                     An internship is a cooperative educational arrangement between the student, the University
                        of Memphis, and a community partner. Each year more than 5,000 UofM students are interning
                        in schools, hospitals, businesses, nonprofit organizations and government agencies.
                        Through internships, the community offers students the opportunity to:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Enhance professional development with first hand experience in the world of work
                        
                        Build an effective resume that results in better job offers after graduation
                        
                        Improve knowledge, skills, and abilities to meet career goals
