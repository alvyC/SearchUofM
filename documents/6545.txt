                        Naseeb Shaheen, who was a professor in the English Department at the University of
                        Memphis for many years. Dr. Shaheen wrote extensively about early modern literature,
                        chiefly Shakespeare. His books on biblical references in Shakespeare's plays (1999,
                        2002) and Spenser's The Faerie Queene (1976) remain the definitive work in this field.
                        He also published a two-volume Pictorial History of Ramallah (Palestine) (1992, 2006).
                        In addition to his scholarly work, Dr. Shaheen was a noted philanthropist and collector
                        of pre-King James English Bibles.

                     The U of M English Department is pleased to welcome Prof. William J. Maxwell of Washington
                        University in St. Louis, who will deliver the Seventh Annual Naseeb Shaheen Memorial
                        Lecture on October 20, 2016 . Prof. Maxwell's talk is entitled: "Born-Again, Seen-Again James Baldwin: State Surveillance,
                        Afro-Pessimism, and the Literary History of Black Lives Matter." Prof. Maxwell's lecture
                        will be held on October 20th, 2016, at 6:00pm in the University Center River Room
                        (UC 300), and will be preceded by a reception at 5:30pm.
                     
                     
                     James Baldwin, buried in 1987, often looks like today's most vital and beloved new
                        African American author. This lecture will explore the reasons behind Baldwin's resurrection,
                        from his elevated place in the cultural memory of the Black Lives Matter movement,
                        to his function as an antidote to the frozen time of Afro-Pessimism, to his status
                        as an icon of state surveillance and racial counter-surveillance.
