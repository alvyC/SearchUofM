                     ON CAMPUS INTERVIEWS
                     
                     During the fall and spring, employers from around the region conduct interviews on
                        campus for summer associate and post-graduation positions. During the fall, the on-campus
                        interviews (OCI) start in August and end in November. Spring OCI starts in January
                        and end in April.
                     
                     
                     Preparing for OCI
                     
                     The CSO offers two programs to help prepare you for Fall OCI: resume reviews and mock
                        interviews.
                     
                     
                     Resume Review
                     
                     To have your resume reviewed before you apply for OCI, please email it to the Career
                        Services Office at lawcareerservices@memphis.edu
                     
                     Mock Interviews
                     
                     Before OCI, local attorneys will be on campus to conduct mock interviews. Mock interviews
                        are a great opportunity to practice your interview skills and to receive feedback
                        to improve your performance. Interview sessions typically last 30 minutes. To sign
                        up for mock interviews, please follow these instructions  or contact the Career Services Office for assistance.

                     In addition to resume reviews and mock interviews, you can prepare for OCI by checking
                        out our Resume Guide, Cover Letter Guide, and Interview Preparation Handout located
                        in Symplicity's document library.
                     
                     OCI Policies
                     
                     The CSO and all students must adhere to the National Association for Law Placement
                        (NALP) Principles and Standards for employers, law students, and law schools. The
                        policy is found in its entirety at on the NALP Student Professionalism website.
                     
                     You are required to honor all interview appointments unless you have accepted another
                        position by the date of the interview. Emergencies are the only exceptions and must
                        be cleared with the Assistant Dean for Career Services.
                     
                     
                     If you fail to appear for an interview, you must provide a written letter of apology
                        to the employer within 24 hours of the scheduled interview. In the letter, be sure
                        to copy to the Assistant Dean for Career Services. The Assistant Dean has the authority
                        to suspend your access to OCI, Symplicity, or other CSO resources for exhibiting unprofessional
                        behavior.
