                     During the course of employment at the University of Memphis, we hope you are never
                        injured on the job, or suffer from an occupational illness. If you do have an on-the-job
                        injury, proper reporting of the situation will expedite the filing of a claim for
                        medical expenses and compensation if necessary.
                     
                     
                     What should I do if I am injured on the job?
                     
                     
                        
                        If it is an emergency, seek treatment at the nearest emergency room. Then contact
                           your supervisor and the University Benefits Administration Office as soon as possible
                           to start the claim process.
                        
                        
                        In a non-emergency, notify your supervisor immediately and follow the steps below.
                           
                           
                              
                              Tell your supervisor what happened, how it happened, who saw what happened, and if
                                 you were injured as a result of the accident.
                              
                              
                              You and your supervisor should then call the Workplace Injury and First Notice of

                              Select option #1 to speak with a registered nurse who will evaluate the nature of
                                 your injury and determine your immediate care or treatment options. Your supervisor
                                 will only verify that you are reporting a work related injury to the registered nurse.
                              
                              
                              If no medical treatment is recommended, the registered nurse will document the call
                                 for you and your supervisor and enter an incident report in the reporting system.
                              
                              
                              If medical treatment is recommended, the nurse will direct you to the nearest State
                                 approved medical provider.
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        You and your supervisor will need to complete the First Report of Injury or Illness
                           form found online at First Report of Injury or Illness . This form should be returned to the Environmental Health and Safety Office.
