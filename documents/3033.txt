                     Contact Minutes
                     
                     Courses are required to meet a minimum number of contact minutes based on their credit
                        hour values. Instructors teaching sections that fall short of minimum contact minutes
                        should supplement course meeting requirements to ensure that the minimum is reached.
                        Refer to the Contact Minutes page for information on determining minimum contact minutes.

                     The charts allows you to determine if a class adheres to a standard meeting pattern
                        or if it follows a non-standard pattern and, thus, requires approval ( Non-Standard Course Offering Request ). Fall/Spring    |    Summer
