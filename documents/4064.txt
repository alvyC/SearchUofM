                     Graduate Faculty Members
                     
                     Before undertaking ANY work on a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation, a faculty
                        committee must be formed, and the Graduate School should be notified of said committee
                        (minimum of three members for a master's thesis committee; minimum of four members
                        for a doctoral dissertation committee). It is the student's responsibility to ensure
                        that all members of their committee are current members of the graduate faculty. Students
                        must not defend their document until all committee members have U of M graduate faculty
                        status, even if a committee member is not affiliated with this university. Click on the links below to find departmental listings of current graduate faculty
                           members within each college or school.
                     
                     CRITERIA
                     
                     The University maintains six levels of graduate faculty: full, associate, affiliate,
                        adjunct, research co-mentor and teaching adjunct.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Full or associate graduate faculty may chair master's committees.
                        
                        Only Full graduate faculty members may chair doctoral committees.
                        
                        Associate members may direct theses in an academic department other than their own
                           at the discretion of the graduate coordinator and/or the chair of that department.
                        
                        
                        Affiliate or adjunct graduate faculty may be members of doctoral and master's committees
                           in their areas of expertise, but may not chair them.
                        
                        
                        No more than one adjunct or affiliate graduate faculty member may serve as a voting
                           member of a student's committee.
                        
                        
                        Teaching adjuncts members may not serve on graduate faculty committees.
                        
                     
                     
                     If the chair of a student's committee leaves the University of Memphis, that person
                           can no longer serve as chair and must be replaced by another graduate faculty member.
