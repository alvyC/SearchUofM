                     The University of Memphis worked with the Tennessee Department of the Treasury in
                        the development of the SmartTennessee program. Through the leadership of Treasurer
                        David Lillard, the University secured an additional $150,000 to be matched by $100,000
                        by First Tennessee. The program, which is in its 6th year, has already trained teachers
                        in over 150 schools across Tennessee.
