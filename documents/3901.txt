                      The CWC is please to offer faculty a number of services that can support their students’
                     writing and communication.  - Classroom Orientation. Faculty can request a representative from the CWC to visit
                     their classroom and give a short, 15-minute orientation to students about what the
                     CWC does and how they can take advantage of our services. - Class Visits to the CWC. Faculty can schedule a time to bring their students directly
                     to the CWC in McWherter Library. We will give students a short orientation and show
                     them how they can use the CWC and the library’s reference resources in tandem. - Support for particular assignments. If you encourage your students to visit the
                     CWC for a particular assignment, one of our representatives can meet with you to get
                     a copy of the assignment and discuss how best to assist your students.  If you would like to schedule an orientation or CWC visit, or if you have any other
                     questions, please send an email to cwc@memphis.edu.
