                        for any programs are subject to state contractual terms and does not constitute a
                        contract between the student and the UofM.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis reserves the right to make changes as required in course
                        offerings, curricula, academic policies and other rules and regulations affecting
                        students to be effective whenever determined by the institution. These changes will
                        govern current and formerly enrolled students. Enrollment of all students is subject
                        to these conditions. Any fees, charges or costs, and all academic regulations set
                        forth in this Catalog are subject to change at any time, and all courses, programs,
                        and activities described in this Catalog are subject to cancellation or termination
                        by the UofM or the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) at any time.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis provides the opportunity for students to increase their
                        knowledge by providing programs of instruction in the various disciplines and programs
                        through faculty who, in the opinion of the institution, are trained and qualified
                        for teaching at the college level. However, the acquisition of knowledge by any student
                        is contingent upon the student's desire and ability to learn and the application of
                        appropriate study techniques to any course or program. Thus, the University must necessarily
                        limit representation of student preparedness in any field of study to the competency
                        demonstrated at that specific point in time at which appropriate academic measurements
                        were taken to certify course or program completion. (TBR 2:04:00:01)
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis offers equal educational opportunity to all persons without
                        regard to race, religion, sex, creed, color, national origin or disability. The University
                        does not discriminate on these bases in recruitment and admission of students or in
                        the operation of its programs and activities, as specified by federal laws and regulations.
