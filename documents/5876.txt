scada Workshop/Tutorial on Automation and Control Device/SCADA
Instructor: Dr. Thomas L. Pigg, Jackson State Community College, Tennessee
Instructor: Robert Hamilton, Information Security Specialist, Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education
Time: 1pm - 5pm
 
This Pre-Cyber Expo workshop will focus on the threats directed toward our nation's critical infrastructures, the vulnerabilities these infrastructures present and potential defense mechanisms that may be deployed to thwart potential attacks. The proposed workshop would meet in a computer lab at the Center for Information Assurance, the University of Memphis from 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM. The workshop will include discussions, demonstrations and hands-on labs. The workshop will be conducted by the Tennessee Cyber Security Education Consortium. It is also proposed that a small fee be charged to those who attend the workshop. It will probably be necessary to limit the number of participants for this workshop to the number of computer workstations available in the computer lab.
