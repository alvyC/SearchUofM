                     When requesting student acquisition of course content resources (e.g. textbook, readings,
                        online materials, etc.) it is imperative that faculty take into consideration a broad
                        range of course content accessibility issues including, but not limited to, cost,
                        format, platform, and availability.  Faculty are strongly encouraged to insure course
                        content resources can be readily available for student use in a common area, such
                        as the University Libraries' reserve rooms or electronic reserves system, with disability-related
                        accessibility for all users at all times, on all devices.
