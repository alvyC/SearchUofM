                     Termination Procedures
                     
                     Graduate Students may be terminated from a program for a second failure on comprehensive
                        examination, unsuccessful defense of thesis or dissertation, a second consecutive
                        semester on academic probation, or an action of a program retention committee.
                     
                     
                     Procedures for notifying students of termination:
                     
                     
                        
                        The Advisor informs the student of intended recommendation to terminate.
                        
                        The student's Advisor consults the Graduate Coordinator of the program.
                        
                        The Advisor, Graduate Coordinator, and/or Department Chair review the recommendation.
                           If approved the Advisor, Graduate coordinator, and/or Department Chair sign and submit
                           the termination form for review to the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies for the student's College or
                           School. The Associate Dean will consult all relevant parties.
                        
                        
                        If approved, the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies signs and submits termination
                           form to the Graduate School.
