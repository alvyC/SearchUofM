                           The primary focus of my research pertains to ground-water migration and contaminant
                              transport through field investigations and numerical modeling. All of my research
                              is multi-disciplinary crossing multiple departments and academic institutions. Numerous
                              students are involved in my research, allowing them to exercise their book smarts
                              and apply their ideas.
