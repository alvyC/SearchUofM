                     UofM Doctoral Student in Psychology Receives NIH Dissertation Grant
                     
                     July 23, 2015 - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded Lidia Meshesha,
                        a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Memphis, a two-year dissertation
                        grant titled Behavioral Economic Supplement for Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment.
                     
                     
                     The grant will provide support for Meshesha to complete an ambitious dissertation
                        study in a community alcohol treatment center and to further her training as an addiction
                        researcher.
                     
                     
                     Alcohol use disorders are associated with substantial individual and societal costs,
                        according to Dr. James Murphy, professor of psychology. "Existing alcohol treatments
                        are helpful for some individuals, but rates of relapse are high and there is a need
                        for novel treatment elements that incorporate technology and help individuals in recovery
                        develop constructive alternatives to drinking," he said. Murphy received funding from
                        NIH to develop a behavioral economic alcohol intervention for college students who
                        drink heavily that increases engagement in both constructive alternatives to drinking
                        and in thinking about the future.
                     
                     
                     Meshesha's dissertation grant will extend this intervention approach to adults who
                        are participating in intensive outpatient treatment for alcohol use disorders. Her
                        approach will include novel technological elements, including the use of text message-based
                        intervention elements to encourage engagement in constructive alternatives and drug-free
                        activities focused on the future.
                     
                     
                     Murphy is the faculty supervisor for the grant, and will collaborate with Dr. Edward
                        Wise, director of the Mental Health Resources treatment facility, as well as leading
                        addiction researchers from Brown University, the University of Florida and University
                        of New Mexico.
