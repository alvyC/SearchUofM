                     STUDENT SPOTLIGHT: Jennifer Jarvis
                     
                     "Mmmm, not all Engineers are Created Equal!"
                     
                     Jenny Jarvis, a Biomedical Engineering doctoral student, has an amazing educational
                        career story that shows promise for all of her pursuits beyond the completion of her
                        degree. Jarvis is a native of Niagara, Wisconsin; she received her undergraduate degree
                        in Chemistry from Northern Michigan University. Jarvis is an avid science lover, and
                        earning a Bachelor's degree was just the beginning for her. Jarvis's passion for science
                        steered her to the University of Memphis where she obtained her Master's degree in
                        Biomedical Engineering in 2014 and expects to graduate with her PhD in the summer
                        of 2017. Jarvis's work with the University has certainly garnered attention. Incorporating
                        knowledge from her previous studies in Chemistry, she designs chemical sensors for
                        measuring ions (e.g. potassium, sodium, calcium) in whole blood. Although these ion
                        sensors are used every day in clinics and hospitals, there are currently no easy-to-use
                        at home ion sensors that patients may use without having to visit a physician. Jarvis's
                        amazing work will allow for patients to measure their ion concentrations with a disposable
                        ion sensor using just a drop of blood in the comfort of their own homes. Jarvis chose the University of Memphis to pursue her graduate studies because of the
                        University's partnership with the UT Health Science Center, which has expanded the
                        breadth of her academic studies. The University of Memphis Biomedical Engineering
                        program has variety and diversity, and the opportunities have been endless because
                        of the increased faculty and class experiences. These double resources have been nothing
                        short of amazing for Jarvis, and she truly appreciates the variety of professionals
                        with whom she has been able to work. Jarvis wants students to know that graduate education is the opportunity to mold one's
                        self and find one's passion. She feels strongly that students should consider the
                        University of Memphis to pursue their graduate degrees. Jarvis notes that the faculty
                        truly care about their students; they push for internships for their students, and
                        they help students find jobs upon graduation. Most importantly, the faculty care about
                        every student's experience at the University and their overall success. When asked what she likes most about the University of Memphis, Jarvis replied, "The
                        opportunities that I have been provided have been great, although unexpected." Jarvis
                        has traveled to Nashville to speak to legislators about her research and the importance
                        of graduate school education. She took advantage of an opportunity to travel abroad
                        to Turku, Finland and study with top researchers in her field. She loves that she
                        gets to take business trips with companies that are in her area of interest, as she
                        gains experience and new ideas. The variety provided by the Biomedical Engineering
                        program has allowed her to find her "perfect fit." Since graduation is a year and
                        half away, Jarvis is taking time to explore her opportunities and possibilities. With
                        her experiences from The University of Memphis, her future is undoubtedly boundless.
