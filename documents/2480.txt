                     Focus Area on Egyptology
                     
                     The Department of History at the University of Memphis offers both an MA and PhD in
                        History with a concentration in Egyptology. While other Egyptology programs at major
                        institutions across North America concentrate in Egyptian language, art history, and
                        archaeology, the University of Memphis is unique in offering a graduate program in
                        Ancient Egyptian history and historiography at both the Masterâ€™s and Doctoral level.
                        At the same time, we provide our students with advanced training in Egyptological
                        philology, art history, and archaeology through the History and Art History Departments.
                        As a public university, we offer all this at a highly competitive price at the only
                        Egyptology program in the southern United States.
                     
                     
                     Within the Department of History, we approach the advanced study of the language,
                        culture, and history of ancient Egypt from an interdisciplinary perspective centered
                        on historical practices and methodology. Our students learn not just the basics of
                        Egyptian history, but become firmly grounded in the historiography and practices of
                        Egyptological research and writing within the field. Gaining other necessary skills
                        in the disciplines of philology, archaeology, and art history, our students research
                        wide-ranging topics within Egyptian history under the direction of Drs. Peter Brand
                        and Suzanne Onstine. Students also have opportunities to travel to Egypt and participate
                        in field projects there.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Brand specializes in the political history and foreign relations of Pharaonic
                        Egypt, especially during the New Kingdom, as well as the study of Egyptian historical
                        texts. As an expert in monumental epigraphy, he also directs the Karnak Hypostyle Hall Project Â which gives students opportunities to study and record monumental reliefs and inscriptions
                        from one of Egypt most iconic structures, the Great Temple of Amun-Re at Karnak. Dr.
                        Onstineâ€™s focus is on social history with special interests in gender, religion, and
                        Nubian cultures. Her background in anthropology and archaeology support the programâ€™s
                        commitment to interdisciplinary approaches. Students are also able to take courses
                        with Dr. Chrystal Goudsouzian, an instructor in the department, who specializes in
                        daily life and religion, with a focus on Egyptian women, gender, sexuality, and the
                        body. Additionally, the Department of Artâ€™s Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology , or IEAA, currently employs three Egyptologists who offer graduate level courses
                        in Middle Egyptian language, art history, and museum studies.
