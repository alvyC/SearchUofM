                     1 How to calculate the price of a histology project: a UM user who requests to have
                           10 tissue samples processed & embedded and 2 H&E stained slides per tissue samples
                           will be charged: $50 (processing and embedding) + $2.5x10x2 + $40x3 hrs tech time (may vary depending
                           on the tissue sample) = $220
                     
                     2 How to calculate the cost of a SEM project: for biological samples, about 3 hours
                           of technician time are needed in addition to critical point drying and sputter coating.
                           Non-biological samples may or may not require technician time for preparation.
                     
                     3 Consumables are charged at cost and this cost varies depending on the number of samples
                           processed. Processing biological samples for TEM is labor intensive and project cost
                           is therefore determined by technician time. A typical project may require anywhere
                           between 10 to 20 hours of technician time depending on the number of samples and how
                           difficult they are to section.
                     
                     Turn Around Time
                     
                     For routine histology and transmission electron microscopy sample processing, turn
                        around time is dependent on the workload, service requested and request volume, but
                        we strive for 3-7 working days turn around time.
                     
                     
                     Quotation
                     
                     If needed, the lab manager will provide a quotation after discussing the project scope
                        with the user. The quotation will be based on current IMC fee schedule.

                        ensure efficient operations and to provide for an organized and traceable workflow.
