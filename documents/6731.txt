                        available to business majors through the Professional Development Center. Invest in

                     Make your Résumé stand out
                     
                     Your resume is your potential future employer's first impression of you, so make it
                        stand out for all the right reasons. Hiring managers typically spend no more than
                        30 seconds reviewing job candidate résumés, so whatever makes you competitive must
                        be easy to spot. In addition, your résumé reflects your ability to communicate, which
                        is one of the top five most demanded skills in today's job market. Remember, you never
                        get a second chance to make a first impression!
                     
                     
                     Start with these helpful tools.
                     
                     Resume Planner – this worksheet will help you get the ball rolling. Resume Packet – this helpful guide will assist you in preparing your career-related content.
                     
                     
                     Choose the right template.
                     
                     To help get you noticed, we've developed templates for two different types of résumés,
                        based on recommendations from recruiters for several top companies - ones you've definitely
                        heard of! As you review each version, consider your unique experience and ask yourself,
                        "What experience do I currently have that would impress an employer?"
                     
                     
                     Sample Version A is right for you if your experience is related mostly to academics and campus or
                        community involvement. Sample Version B is for you if your skills and experience are closely tied to your work history. Be

                     The Fogelman Internship Network (FIN) is a great place for your resume to be seen by lots of potential employers. First,

                     ACE YOUR INTERVIEW
                     
                     So, you've landed an interview! Now it's time for a mock interview, which will serve
                        as a dress rehearsal for your real interview. Your coach will present you with some
                        of the most commonly asked interview questions and provide valuable feedback about
                        the content of your responses and your communication style (both verbal and non-verbal).
                        She will point out your areas of strength and give you constructive tips for making
                        improvements where needed. You will leave feeling much more confident and better prepared
                        for the "real thing."
