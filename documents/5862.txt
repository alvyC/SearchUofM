                     As part of an ongoing research effort, AMUM is searching for original works of art
                        by Samuel Hester Crone.
                     
                     
                     Samuel Crone was born on May 2nd, 1858 in Columbia Tennessee. Shortly after, his family
                        moved to Memphis. At the age of 17 he left Memphis to study at the Royal Academy of
                        Fine Arts in Munich, Germany. He spent nearly four decades moving around Europe, where
                        he developed a level of skill comparable to the most prolific and well-known artists
                        of his time. At the age of 55, he decided to return to the United States – but contracted
                        pnuemonia and died only a few short days after his arrival. Though he was always able
                        to make a living as an artist, he never recieved much attention during his lifetime,
                        or afterwards. To this day, his work is a mystery to all but a handful of scholars
                        and collectors.
                     
                     
                     Crone self portrait AMUM is currently in the process of developing an in-depth online
                        resource that catalogs known works and records vital information. We hope to help
                        transform Crone's "big story" into legacy by bringing this information to the public.
                        Please contact Leslie Luebbers if you know of any paintings, drawings, or related material by this 19th century
                        American artist.
                     
                     
                     From Home to Memphis, by Elizabeth Jane Walk |The University of Memphis Magazine,
                        Winter 2001
                     
                     
                     "The circuitous trip of Crone's artwork from Europe to Memphis is a fascinating story
                        involving academic curiosity, tenacity and good fortune. When architect William Huff
                        was a young man, his mother presented him with about 200 sketches wrought by his great
                        uncle through marriage, Samuel Crone. "She said, 'Well you're the artistic one in
                        the family so you should have these," recalls Huff, who at the time was being indoctrinated
                        into modern art in his pursuit of architectural studies. "I sort of thanked her and
                        put them in the back of my closet and didn't do much with them. They just stayed there
                        for a decade or so."
                     
                     
                     Later, Huff worked for the legendary Philadelphia architect Louis Kahn, who was a
                        gifted artist. "Kahn was quite a master at making wonderful sketches," says Huff.
                        Kahn's influence convinced Huff that the sketches languishing in the closet were worthy
                        of serious attention. With his curiosity piqued, Huff eventually took the sketches
                        to Carnegie Institute's Museum of Art for a second opinion. Impressed by the sketches,
                        the curator proposed mounting a Crone exhibit. Then he posed a simple question to
                        Huff: "What do you know about Crone?"
                     
                     
                     Huff suddenly realized that his knowledge of his great uncle was restricted to a few
                        family anecdotes, an incomplete genealogical entry, a handful of photographs and the
                        portfolio of sketches.
                     
                     
                     Huff's adventure would take him to a country cemetery in Pennsylvania, across Europe
                        and finally to Memphis, Tennessee and the Art Museum of the University of Memphis.
                        AMUM has organized three exhibitions of Samuel H. Crone's work: A Return to Memphis:
                        The Art of Samuel Hester Crone, 1997; Samuel H. Crone: The Working Process of a 19th
                        Century Painter, 2001; and Samuel H. Crone: Answers and Questions, 2005. "Thus began
                        an itinerary whose course was hazy, but objective clear: to bring to Samuel Hester
                        Crone a measure of recognition in the annals of American art," writes Huff in an article
                        about his family member. "Suddenly, the lack of a substantial record of the artist's
                        background, its revelatory context of place and time, was threatening my hope for
                        Uncle (Great Uncle, to me) Sam's overdue recognition. I soon turned that distress,
                        however, into the adventure of an open-ended search."
                     
                     
                     Huff has decided to bequeath his large collection to the University of Memphis, along
                        with an endowment that will be used for preservation and study. Leslie Luebbers, Art
                        Museum Director, says the works will complement the Art Museum's permanent collection.
                        "The drawings are absolutely wonderful," says Luebbers. "Even the quickest little
                        line sketches are pretty glorious. The paintings range from finished paintings to
                        oil sketches," she continues. "And they range in style form his earliest kind of academic
                        paintings, which are in the style of late Baroque painting, up to abstract expressionist
                        landscapes. In particular, a series of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906 are
                        spectacularly expressionistic."
                     
                     
                     Huff continues his quest and adventure, searching for the paintings of Samuel Crone
                        sold in Europe; and AMUM's plans call for a Web site that will serve as a Crone clearing
                        house.
