                     As we approach June 30th, the end of FY 2016, the Accounting Office is reminding financial
                        managers, administrative officials, department heads, and directors of accounts to
                        carefully review your financial activity and submit corrections to the Accounting
                        Office as soon as possible.
                     
                     
                     Remember that you may monitor your account activity by accessing Banner Self-Service
                        or INB. This allows you to review current activity within your account and eliminates
                        the need to wait for e~Print reports.
