                     Universities across the globe are grappling with the issue of "Free Speech" in classrooms
                           and on campus communities. Some believe that free speech is under attack. Others believe
                           that there is too much protection for abusive or hateful language. Should speech be
                           monitored? Should trigger warnings be added before discussion of sensitive classroom
                           discussions and texts? Where do we draw the line between freedom and abuse, and between
                           sensitivity and censorship? 
                     
                     On November 9, 2016, Professor Steve Mulroy of the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law
                           will facilitate the Critical Conversations forum on free speech.
                     
                     Topics will include:
                     
                      â¢ What is free speech and why do we value it? â¢ Where is the divide between free speech and hate speech? â¢ How do free speech and academic freedom intersect?

                     Through an engaging discussion among students, faculty, staff, and the Memphis community
                        about key issues that impact our city and nation, we hope to sustain and facilitate

                        tactics that facilitate this collaboration among the U of M and community leaders.

                     The Final Word: The Supreme Court, Marriage, Same Sex Couples, and the Constitution

                     The hotly contested issue of who one can marry has come before the United States Supreme
                        Court twice in two different contexts. In 1967, in Loving v. Virginia, the United
                        States Supreme Court struck down state laws that banned interracial marriages. Almost
                        50 years later, on April 8, 2015, in DeBoer v. Synder, the Supreme Court will hear
                        arguments on the following two constitutional questions: 1) can a state legally refuse
                        to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples?; and 2) must a state legally recognize
                        marriages of same sex couples legally wed in other states? Two of the plaintiffs in
                        the DeBoer case, Ijpe DeKoe and Thomas Kostura, from Tennessee, are joined by couples
                        from Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio in their challenge to state laws that do not recognize
                        same-sex marriages.
                     
                     
                     At this event, plaintiffs DeKoe, Kostura, and their attorney Maureen T. Holland from
                        Memphis, TN will discuss the constitutional issues involved in this case.
                     
                     
                     This event is free and open to the public.
                     
                     This event is co-sponsored by the Director of Diversity Initiatives and the Office
                        of the Provost; The Critical Conversations Committee at the University of Memphis;

                     The University of Memphis' Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice will host
                        the panel discussion "Brown, Garner and Martin: Police and Social Justice."Â In the
                        wake of the recent deaths of Michael Brown, Antonio Martin and Eric Garner, African-American
                        and other communities are grappling with the fairness of American institutions and
                        their processes, including the criminal courts, the grand jury and law enforcement,
                        while others view law enforcement and the administration of criminal justice as fair
                        and just.Â How do we as a community and nation bridge these divided opinions and experiences?
                        How do we as a nation protect the rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness
                        for all people? What issues are at play in policing diverse communities and in the
                        use of deadly force? What are the roles and responsibilities of the prosecutor, the
                        grand jury and the criminal courts? How can citizens improve or change these processes
                        to promote civility, democratic ideals, fairness and equality?
                     
                     
                     Dr. K.B. Turner, Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, will
                        moderate the discussion.

Hook's Institute for Social Change Â· Trey Moore, Criminal Justice Graduate Student, University of Memphis Â· Steven Mulroy, Professor of Law, University of Memphis Â· Mary Tucker, Professor of Criminal Justice, University of Memphis
