                     The Data Warehouse is a database designed for analytical and information processing.
                        Data are extracted from the university's business systems into a single integrated
                        information asset. The warehouse is a read-only collection of data intended to answer
                        business questions.
                     
                     
                     A Data Warehouse can:
                     
                     
                        
                        enable users with better information,
                        
                        improve accessibility to integrated data,
                        
                        enable informed decision-making leading to increased or improved service,
                        
                        improve data quality in the OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing) systems,
                        
                        improve consistency with data from multiple systems,
                        
                        help identify hidden business opportunities, and
                        
                        act as a strategic planning tool.
                        
                     
                     
                     The Data Warehouse is an On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) system that is populated
                        using data from the University's operational systems—also known as an On-Line Transaction
                        Processing (OLTP) systems. An OLAP system provides a means of archiving data gathered
                        over time by OLTP systems, and then analyzing that data for trends. OLAP and OLTP
                        can be compared in the following ways:

                        What data is contained in the Data Warehouse?
                        
                        Data contained in the Data Warehouse is organized by Subject Areas such as Student,
                           Course, Census, Employee, Financial Aid, Person, Finance, Alumni, and Bursar.  Most
                           subject areas contain data from both Banner (current ERP system) and PLUS (prior ERP
                           system).
                        
                        How frequently is the Data Warehouse updated?
                        
                        The Data Warehouse is updated every week day. This is determined based on user information
                           needs and the confines of the systems that run the University's daily business.

                           completing the training course, access can be requested here .
