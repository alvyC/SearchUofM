                     Preengineering Enrichment Project (PEEP)
                     
                     An environmental enrichment program, Pre-Engineering Enrichment Project (PEEP), is
                        conducted during the summer and directed by Dr. Larry W. Houk, Professor of Chemistry
                        at The University of Memphis. He is assisted by a graduate student or city school
                        teacher who serves as a liaison, mentor, advisor, and counselor. Ten high school scholars
                        from East High School in the Memphis City School System are selected as program participants.
                        All participants are currently majoring in either mathematics or science and are members
                        of economically disadvantaged families.
                     
                     
                     The program is approximately seven weeks in duration. Participants work and study
                        in a variety of local settings in order to become familiar with a wide range of water
                        resource needs and challenges. Students acquire first-hand experience:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        testing treated wastewater to manually check settling and removal efficiencies at
                           each stage of treatment at two advanced wastewater treatment facilities;
                        
                        
                        inspecting sewers, manholes, and flood control equipment for maintenance, repair,
                           and/or replacement;
                        
                        
                        using surveyor's equipment to read topography; and
                        
                        studying aquatic life found in neighboring streams, lakes, and rivers.
                        
                        Students will meet professional role models (chemists, engineers, journalists, biologists,
                           journalists, professors, administrators, regulatory specialists, etc.) who gladly
                           entertain questions regarding careers, on-the-job training, and educational preparedness.
                           The students will receive attentive, hands-on instruction and coaching throughout
                           the course of their classroom, laboratory, and field assignments. A salary is provided.
