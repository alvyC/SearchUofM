                     "Getting a job interview is much easier now. I hadn't worked in years. I was a stay
                        at home mom for 14.5 years before I enrolled in Finish Line. No one was trying to
                        hire or interview me before I graduated. I'm so excited! Thinking about getting a
                        Master's degree is no longer a thought. I'm about to make it happen. That Doctorate
                        degree isn't too far away either." -- Sharon Green, Finish Line Graduate
                     
                      
                     
                      
                     
                      
                     
                      
                     
                       "I started at the University of Memphis when I was in the middle of my career as a
                           professional firefighter in Charleston, SC. Several years and one 3 year-old later,
                           when I graduate in May I will have been a professional Fire Captain for four years.
                           I am the only female captain in my department. The U of M has prepared me for success,
                           which will only continue until retirement. Earning my bachelor's degree has further
                           inspired me to move on to graduate school." -- Sarah Bootle, Professional Studies

                     Finish Line provided the flexibility I needed to keep my job while continuing my education.
                           The program has been a true blessing. My journey has been 10 years in the making,
                           striving to find a way to complete my undergraduate degree. I also had an amazing
                           advisor who was with me every step of the way. I can proudly say that I am a college
                           graduate!  – Kimberly
                     
                     
                      
                     
                      
                     
                      
                     
                     
                     
                     I feel grateful to finally have the diploma that I worked so hard to achieve many
                           years ago. It was awesome to see my kids in the crowd at graduation. They now know
                           that it is never too late to achieve your goals. The people at the Finish Line program
                           were instrumental in making my dreams of graduation a reality. They made the whole
                           process very simple and for that I am truly grateful. The program is a wonderful addition
                           to the University of Memphis .  – John
                     
                     
                      
                     
                      
                     
                      
                     
                      
                     The Finish Line program was a lifesaver. Now that I have completed my bachelor's degree,
                        I feel a new confidence. – Brian
                     
                      
                     
                      The thought of going back to school while working and raising a family would not
                           have been possible had it not been for the Finish Line program. I have now obtained
                           the college degree that all of my friends and peers have. I succeeded, it just took
                           a little longer! – Stuart
                     
                     Finish Line has been a true blessing. The program allowed me to pursue my dream of
                        becoming the first person in my family to complete my bachelor's degree. – Kendra
