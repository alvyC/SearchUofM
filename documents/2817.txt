                     Many people gamble without any problems. But, for some, gambling can create disruptions
                        and damage to major areas of a person's life, including finances, emotional health,
                        physical health, family and other social relationships, work or school. Problem gambling
                        can look differently for many individuals.
                     
                     
                     Between 6 and 10 million U.S. adults per year from all walks of life experience negative
                        effects from their gambling. Problem gambling is not defined by the amount of money
                        lost or how often someone gambles. People who gamble problematically cannot control
                        their gambling, and it often interferes with their relationships, finances, and work.
                        At The Gambling Clinic, our goal is to help people use their personal strengths and
                        resources to change their gambling behavior.
