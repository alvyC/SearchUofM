	   We are
always striving to better serve our members. We are excited to
announce the launch of our new website and UMAA Network!

New features of the network include:

    Online Event Registration
    Member Directory
    Enhanced Membership Forms
    
    User Profiles
    Mobile Friendly
    

Follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete the "First-Time Login" and edit your profile.
For additional assistance, contact us at alumniassociation@memphis.edu or 901.678.2586.

 

 



    Select " First-Time Login " at the top right:
    
    Enter your name
    Account Lookup:
    There might be more than one person with the same name. Please select
    the marker next to your correct listing and click "Next". 
         
    
    Verify your account by entering your " Banner ID " (Ex: U00012345)
    
    Create a Username and Password    
    (Finally! You're no longer limited to your assigned UofM username,
    so you can add those vowels you've been missing back in!)
    *Please note: Your primary email can be updated at any time.
    
    Each
    time you visit the UMAA Network, you will login with this username and password - or - you can utilize the "Social Sign-On" feature.
    The first time you login using one of your social media accounts, you will be prompted to authorize that account to be used with "Encompass." On subsequent visits to the UMAA Network, just click your chosen social media sign-in button and, if you're already logged in to the social media account, you are immediately logged in to the Network. If you aren't already logged in with the social media account, you will be prompted to do so. Your social media account log-in credentials (user name and password) are never shared with us or our website provider. 
    

 

 

After logging in, select "My Profile" in the top nagivation:



    Use the guide below to update your contact information. 
    Only the information you approve will appear as public to other UofM Alumni Association members. (User must be logged in to view.) Be sure to select the "Community Profile" toggle to view what is visible to the public.
    
    Select the image to upload a profile picture.
    Use the navigation below your profile picture to submit Class Notes, upload photos and check your membership and giving history.
    The "Job Postings" tab allows you to post an open position at your place of employment to share with other Tiger alumni. Please note: Each posting must be approved by a UMAA admin before the posting will appear.
