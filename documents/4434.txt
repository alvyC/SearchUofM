                        information technology infrastructure, provides the leadership to involve students,
                        faculty, and staff in technology decision-making, and leads the strategic planning
                        process for the use of information technologies.
                     
                     
                     The IT HelpDesk (901.678.8888) is the first area of contact for students, staff, and
                        faculty to establish accounts and report problems. The HelpDesk staff is the primary
                        contact on questions related to software, telecommunications, network, and lab support.
                        In addition they route and track questions to the most appropriate university personnel
                        for resolution. Since the University operates on a Local Support Provider (LSP) model
                        (i.e., schools and colleges as well as administrative units have departmental computer
                        experts to assist them with technology), calls to the HelpDesk are frequently assigned
                        to an LSP for resolution. However, the knowledge management system of the HelpDesk
                        tracks the problem and its resolution for future reference. The HelpDesk also makes
                        available desktop and server software for faculty computers and departmental servers.
                     
                     
                     Students can access two IT-supported 24-hour computer labs (one of which is a Super
                        Lab and Smart Classroom) and over 65 other departmental labs located in various buildings
                        and residence halls throughout the University. Over 30 smart classrooms with a full
                        range of multimedia equipment are available for use by all faculty members and each
                        classroom building is equipped with EduCarts (SmartCarts) that can turn almost any
                        classroom into a "smart room." Many departmental labs have extended evening and weekend
                        hours and students have access to the Internet, e-mail, Microsoft software, and a
                        host of academic-related applications in a variety of computing environments. All
                        labs are equipped with printers and other peripheral devices.
                     
                     
                     Information Technology provides a variety of technology support services to faculty,
                        staff, and students including software training, software distribution, and web consulting.
                        The Advanced Learning Center (ALC) provides consulting assistance for on-line and
                        web-assisted course development. Students and faculty can attend free training seminars
                        at the Training Center in Smith 412. The center is equipped with PCs, Macs, and smart
                        presentation equipment. Faculty may reserve this facility as well as any of the smart
                        classrooms for their instructional needs. Training courses and workshops are offered
                        on all supported software. The Faculty Resource area in the Advanced Learning Center
                        contains the latest multimedia and computer equipment for faculty and instructors
                        to learn technologies or create course material. Online CBT (Computer-Based Training)
                        is available free to all students, faculty, and staff either over the web or through
                        downloadable tutorials. There are currently over 200 courses available to choose from.
                     
                     
                     Information Technology supports and maintains the University's fiber network that
                        connects all offices, computer labs, classrooms and auditoriums, and selected residence
                        halls. IT is committed to advancing the use of technology to assist the University
                        in education and research. As part of this effort, The University of Memphis is a
                        full partner and an Early Adopter of Internet-2 technology for research and instruction.
                     
                     
                     IT provides all telecommunication services (such as FAX and long distance service),
                        cable TV, and calling number ID. Most of these services are also available in the
                        dormitories.
