                     Distinguished Teaching Award
                     
                     Each year, four members of the University faculty are presented Distinguished Teaching
                        Service Awards in recognition of the high quality of their teaching. The selection
                        procedure prescribes that students, faculty, and alumni be given the opportunity to
                        nominate faculty members who meet the following eligibility requirements:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        The faculty member must have been employed full-time at The University of Memphis
                           for three or more years.
                        
                        
                        The faculty member must be teaching a minimum of nine semester hours with either six
                           undergraduate hours with a total of thirty or more students in two classes or six
                           graduate hours with a total of fifteen or more students in two classes.Â  (The enrollment requirements may be met by including all courses being taught by the
                              faculty member during that term.)
                        
                        Former award winners may not be re-nominated within seven years of the first award
                           and may not receive the award more than twice.
                        
                        
                        At least two of the four awards must go to faculty members whose work is predominantly
                           undergraduate.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Nominations are screened by the Distinguished Teaching Service Awards Committee, and
                        the twenty faculty members receiving the largest number of nominations are notified.
                        If they desire to participate, they are evaluated by their students and department
                        chair.
                     
                     
                     This information is compiled and reviewed by the Committee which then makes the final
                        selections. Each person who is selected receives a $500 honorarium and a certificate
                        at the spring Faculty Meeting.
