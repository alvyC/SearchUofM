                        performs and records new student compositions, commissions, and new works from outside
                        composers on an annual basis.

                     The Jazz Combo program is essential in the jazz curriculum because of the concentration
                        on the art of jazz improvisation. Due to the size and popularity of combos, the program
                        fields anywhere from 8 to 12 combos in a semester. All instrumentalists and vocalists
                        are invited to enroll in the groups. Each combo has one class session of an hour a
                        week and spends extra time on their own to prepare material for performances. The
                        class times are TBA depending on the availability of combo members. For more information,
                        please contact Mr. Tim Goodwin , conductor, by email or at 901.678.3069.
