                        community organizations and selected by the Hooks Institute for their outstanding
                        contributions: Charles Harris, University of Memphis student-athlete; Derwin Sisnett,
                        co-founder and CEO of Gestalt Community Schools; and Pastor Linwood Dillard Jr. of
                        Citadel of Deliverance Temple of God in Christ.
                     
                     
                     Like everyone, African-American men are entitled to "life, liberty and the pursuit
                        of happiness" and the protection of their people and government. The Hooks Institute
                        supports creating a community, a state and a nation that encourages prosperity among
                        African-American men. At the gala, guests will hear the hopes, joys and challenges
                        of African-American men and celebrate those being honored. Proceeds from the gala
                        will be used to help fund Hooks Institute programs, including a new initiative to
                        increase the graduation rate of African-American males attending the U of M.
                     
                     
                     This event is part of the Critical Conversations Series at the University of Memphis,
                        which is focused on human and civil rights, diversity and inclusion.
                     
                     
                     In 1996, University of Memphis officials received approval from the Tennessee Board
                        of Regents to create the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change in the College
                        of Arts & Sciences. The mission of the Institute is teaching, studying and promoting
                        civil rights and social change. The Hooks Institute archives include Hooks' personal
                        papers, which are housed in the Mississippi Valley Collection in the University's
                        McWherter Library.
