                        of world cultures. Non-theological in its orientation, it provides students the opportunity
                        to study related areas, including the history of the Jewish people, the structures
                        and politics of Jewish communities, the Hebrew and Arabic languages, and the religious,
                        intellectual, and aesthetic traditions of the Jewish people.
