                     The International Studies program provides the opportunity to bring the knowledge
                        of several traditional disciplines to bear upon a focal point of human relationships
                        and problems that cross national and cultural boundaries. The program objectives are
                        designed to serve the student who seeks knowledge of the range of contemporary and
                        possible future problems that confront international society and an understanding
                        of alternative national and cultural perspectives on solutions to those problems.
                        The program also serves the needs of students planning a career in the Foreign Service
                        or related agencies of the federal government and students preparing for employment
                        abroad in the private sector, or in international organizations, private or public.
                        The program objectives are to: (a) learn key issues of contention related to the international
                        system; (b) learn central economic, historical, cultural, geographical, and political
                        concepts related to the study of the international system; (c) demonstrate competency
                        in at least one modern foreign language; (e) be able to conduct and present scholarly
                        research on international issues; (f) complete at least one internationally-related
                        experiential learning activity.
                     
                     
                     The program emphasis is on the course work in history, political science, economics,
                        anthropology, and geography, with contributions from other social science disciplines
                        and art. Within the program, the student is required to concentrate a part of the
                        work in the field of American foreign policy or in one of five areas of the world.
                        Students are encouraged to pursue the study of a foreign language and to seek opportunities
                        for travel and study abroad. The student's program should be planned in consultation
                        with the Director or Associate Director of International Studies.
