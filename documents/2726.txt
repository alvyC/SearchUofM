                        Planning prepares students for careers concerned with the physical development of
                        communities, and the interaction of that development with the social, economic, and
                        environmental well-being of communities. The program is fully accredited by the Planning
                        Accreditation Board.

                        policy makers tackle issues of policing strategies, corrections, capital punishment,
                        violence, gangs, addiction, and international crime. The University of Memphis emphasizes
                        research, scholarship, service and community outreach.
