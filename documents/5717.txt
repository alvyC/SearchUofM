                     March 23, 2015 - Memphis attorney Maureen T. Holland and local plaintiffs Ijpe DeKoe
                        and Thomas Kostura will discuss "DeBoer v. Snyder: Marriage Equality in the Supreme
                        Court" Wednesday, April 1, at the University of Memphis in the University Center Ballroom
                        C. A reception will begin at 4:30 p.m., followed by the presentation at 5 p.m.
                     
                     
                     The event is free and open to the public.
                     
                     In January, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to decide whether same-sex couples have
                        a right to marry throughout the United States. Local plaintiffs DeKoe and Kostura,
                        represented by Holland, joined other couples in a consolidated marriage equality case
                        from four states — Tennessee, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio — that do not recognize
                        same-sex marriages. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on April 28 with a
                        decision expected in June.
                     
                     
                     This presentation is part of the Critical Conversations Series, which is focused on
                        human and civil rights, diversity and inclusion. The presentation is jointly sponsored
                        by the Helen Hardin Honors Program, the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change
                        and the following student organizations: Honors Student Council, American Constitution
