                     Accelerated B.A./M.A. Program in Sociology
                     
                     This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master
                        of Arts inÂ Sociology during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin planning
                        to enter the AcceleratedÂ B.A./M.A. program early in their undergraduate career, in
                        consultation with their advisor in the Department of Sociology.
                     
                     
                     Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates
                        selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow
                        them to complete their B.A. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their
                        M.A.
                     
                     
                     To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two
                        reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Sociology department. Each
                        applicant will complete an interview with the graduate academic coordinator in sociology.
                     
                     
                     Students must also apply to the Graduate School for the acceleratedÂ B.A./M.A. program,
                        which allows them to take graduate courses in sociology. To continue in the program
                        past the B.A., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and
                        into theÂ Sociology department's M.A. program.
                     
                     
                     Only in ABM programs, up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both
                        the undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not
                        apply to undergraduate GPA.
