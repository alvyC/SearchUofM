                     The Professional MBA program is designed for full-time professionals who are interested
                        in taking classes part-time to accommodate their busy schedules (although students
                        may enroll on a full-time basis). Classes are primarily offered in the evening. At
                        least one year of full-time work experience is desired prior to admission. Students
                        typically choose one of the five approved concentrations. However, students may opt
                        for a 33 credit hour, no-concentration option, if desired.
                     
                     
                     Each candidate for an MBA degree must complete a minimum of 33 semester hours of course
                        work that include 30 hours of Core Knowledge and Skills. There are no prerequisite
                        courses required for the core curriculum. Students who desire a concentration are
                        required to take an additional 15 hours of coursework beyond the 30 hour Core as per
                        the specifications of each concentration. Students who do not desire an MBA concentration
                        are required to take a 3 hour elective (approved by the MBA Program Director) beyond
                        the 30 hour Core.
