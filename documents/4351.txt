                     The Intermodal Freight Transportation Institute and the FedEx Institute of Technology
                        are hosting Advancing Supply Chains, Logistics, and Transportation of Bio-Products: State of the
                           Art Meets State of the Practice , immediately following IFTI's 10th Annual Intermodal Freight Conference.  This symposium
                        will showcase the cutting edge research taking place here at the University of Memphis
                        as a result of a partnership between the Intermodal Freight Transportation Institute
                        and the FedEx Institute of Technology. This partnership created a Biologistics Research
                        Cluster, home to the University of Memphis Biologistics Research Fellows.    
                     
                     
                     Biologistics can be defined as the management of the safe flow of high value, temperature
                        sensitive, and time-critical biological materials as they are delivered for patient
                        care, analyzed for diagnostic purposes, processed to higher value products or stored
                        to meet physical and data archival needs.  
                     
                     
                     Topics for the Biologists Symposium include:

                     What is Biologistics?
                     
                     The pace at which the biosciences industry and clinical research are evolving has
                        created an explosive demand for temperature-controlled logistics services (cold-chain
                        logistics). The demand for these services is projected to increase by more than 60%
                        by 2020. The intersection of intermodal access and the significant logistics and biosciences
                        industries uniquely positions Memphis to become a leader in this rapidly evolving
                        field known as biologistics.  
                     
                     
                     The unique nature of biomaterials and advanced pharmaceuticals creates new challenges
                        not only for those needing to ship or receive them but also for supply chain and logistics
                        providers due to the high-value and temperature/time sensitive nature of the products
                        and the increasingly stringent regulatory requirements for shipment control and monitoring.
                        This creates a need for new and more advanced storage and distribution infrastructure,
                        customizable supply chain strategies, innovative solutions to scheduling and validation
                        problems, and a highly specialized and compliant network to enable predictive insight,
                        generate alternative procedures, and mitigate risk so that product integrity is maintained.
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     Why Memphis?
                     
                     Known as ' America's Distribution Center ' for extensive infrastructure in all modes, Memphis boasts the second busiest cargo
                        airport in the world, five Class I railroads, the fourth busiest inland port in the
                        country, and the ability to reach more major markets overnight by truck than any other
                        metropolitan area in the nation. This nexus of transportation infrastructure creates
                        significant transportation, logistics and distribution sector job opportunity, with
                        Memphis having a greater percentage of logistics workers in its workforce than any
                        other metropolitan area in the country. The speed to market for the Memphis area is
                        one reason for the robust biosciences industry, and nearly 10% of the Memphis workforce
                        is employed in this sector. This intersection of intermodal access and the significant
                        logistics and biosciences industries uniquely positions Memphis to become a leader in the rapidly evolving field of biologistics.
