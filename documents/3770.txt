		Anecdotally I find many of my online students previously dropped out after having children. Taking classes online seems to be the only way they can complete their degree and take care of their families.
Additionally, a fair number of students are out of state. This can happen when family circumstances force a move that makes getting to campus impractical. Many of these students are in Arkansas or Mississippi, but Iâ€™ve had students as far away as Panama.
I believe some structural changes would make these programs more effective. Right now I believe we are charging out of state students 1.5 times in state tuition for online classes, plus the online fees that all students pay (100 per credit hour). 
While the current arrangement certainly gives higher tuition margins, I think we have to question the perceived value to students. Right now our online teaching platform D2L is pretty clunky. It does not deliver a slick and responsive experience. So in effect we are asking students to pay more to learn online with technology that feels 10 years old. Certainly if we want to expand dual enrollment online we will need to meet the expectations of a younger population. So one proposal is to upgrade our systems to provide a higher value experience.
Another proposal that could be complementary is to reduce our online fees to incentivize out of state and online learning. Does it really cost us an extra 100/credit hour to teach online, or are we saving more than that by teaching online? Other than politics I see no reason to charge out of state online students any more than in state online students. If a flat fee would cut us too much, we could implement a tiered system where students with a certain number of hours have their online fees reduced/eliminated. 
I would be happy to participate in any committee work related to improving our online experience. The IIS has a fairly deep bench when it comes to learning with technology.
