                     Important notice:
                     
                     Unfortunately, we are currently no longer accepting new students for Spring 2017.

                     research that appeals to you, in a collegial and supportive environment
                     
                     At CERI, we bring the added excitement of on-site data collection from two large seismic
                        networks and a GPS network in the central part of the country, deployment of instruments
                        following felt earthquakes, and frequent interaction with visitors from other institutions
                        and government agencies. CERI is the place to be for a graduate student in geophysics!
                     
                     
                     CERI offers two graduate degrees: Master of Science (M.S.) in Earth Sciences with
                        a concentration in Geophysics, and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), also in Earth Sciences
                        with a concentration in Geophysics.
                     
                     
                     What can you expect?
                     
                     You can select the research project you find most exciting, and a temporary committee
                        will be assigned to you based upon your research preference. You 'll discuss potential
                        research projects with all of our faculty members and select your favorite as well
                        as your thesis/dissertation advisor.
