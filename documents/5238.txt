                        First visits to the Center do not require an appointment. Students can walk in Monday-Friday
                           between 10 am and 2 pm to get the ball rolling and meet with staff. Counseling services
                           are confidential and free to enrolled students.
                        
                        
                        It's a good idea to allow about 30 minutes for the first visit. You will have an opportunity
                           to meet with a counselor on staff and to complete a brief and confidential questionnaire.
                        
                        
                        We are committed to minimizing wait times as much as possible. You should be able
                           to see a staff counselor within 15 minutes of your arrival.
                        
                        
                        During the initial first appointment session, you will be asked to describe your current
                           concerns. The staff counselor will make every effort to understand you and your situation
                           and will likely ask questions to obtain specific information about your well-being.
                        
                        
                        At the end of the appointment, the counselor will talk with you about all the services
                           that are available at the center to best meet your needs.
                        
                        
                        We do not have a set number of times a student can be seen by one of our counselors.
