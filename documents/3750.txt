CVSS Acronym for "Common Vulnerability Scoring System."  Open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities.    Designated Personnel University of Memphis technical staff that provide support for faculty, staff and students.  Technical support includes, but is not limited to, computer hardware, computer software, network connectivity and mobile device support.
Encryption Process of converting information into an unintelligible form except to holders of a specific cryptographic key. Use of encryption protects information between the encryption process and the decryption process (the inverse of encryption) against unauthorized disclosure. Firewall Hardware and/or software technology that protects network resources from unauthorized access. A firewall permits or denies computer traffic between networks with different security levels based upon a set of rules and other criteria. Global Payment Brands American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and VISA Inc. Merchant For the purpose of the PCI DSS, a merchant is defined as any entity that accepts payment cards bearing the logos of any of the five members of PCI SSC (American Express Discover, JCB, MasterCard or Visa) as payment of goods and/or services. A merchant that accepts payment cards as payment for goods and/or services can also be a service provider, if the services sold result in storing, processing, or transmitting cardholder data on behalf of other merchants or service providers. PCI Committee The Committee, composed of representatives from ITS, the Bursar's Office and some receipting departments, charged with coordinating the implementation of this policy.
PCI DSS Acronym for "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards".  Comprehensive standards and supporting materials to enhance payment card data security.  The standards provide a robust security process including prevention, detection and appropriate reaction to security incidents. PCI SSC Acronym for "Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council."  The PCI SSC is led by a policy setting Executive Committee, composed of representatives from the five founding global payment brands and strategic members.  The council provides a variety of tools, questionnaires, guidance, FAQ's, training resources and other materials and information to assist organizations seeking to achieve compliance with its standards. QSA Acronym for “Qualified Security Assessor."  Company approved by the PCI SSC to conduct PCI DSS on-site assessments. SAQ Acronym for “Self Assessment Questionnaire.” Tool used by any entity to validate its own compliance with PCI DSS. Scope All system components, people, and processes to be included in a PCI DSS assessment. The first step of a PCI DSS assessment is to accurately determine the scope of the review.
Secure Network Isolated and protected network utilized for the processing of credit card data. Service Provider Business entity that is not a payment brand, directly involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of cardholder data. This also includes companies that provide services that control or could impact the security of cardholder data. Examples include managed service providers that provide managed firewalls, IDS and other services as well as hosting providers and other entities. Entities such as telecommunications companies that only provide communication links without access to the application layer of the communication link are excluded. SNMP Acronym for “Simple Network Management Protocol.” Supports monitoring of network attached devices for any conditions that warrant administrative attention. System Administrator (Department) An individual(s) responsible for the administration and maintenance of their service provider system and user access. Two Factor Authentication Method of authenticating a user, whereby two or more factors are verified. These factors include something the user has (such as hardware or software token), something the user knows (such as a password, passphrase, or PIN) or something the user is or does (such as fingerprints or other forms of biometrics). University “University” refers to the University of Memphis as a whole and includes all units. Un-trusted Network Any network not necessary for the processing and security of credit card data, and maintenance of devices performing those operations. Vulnerability Scan Scan that detects flaws or weaknesses which, if exploited, may result in an intentional or unintentional compromise of a system. Procedures PCI Scope The PCI Committee will review the University's scope, at a minimum annually and upon any credit card payment process change, any request from the University’s acquirer and any changes to PCI regulations. The PCI scope review is based on PCI DSS, *VISA and MasterCard Payment Card Merchant Level as outlined below and the appropriate Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). Upon completion of the SAQ, any remediation will be acted upon immediately and the SAQ will be reevaluated. The University may at any time contract with a QSA to perform a Gap Analysis to determine any compliance gaps that will need to be included in the University PCI scope and any remediation for PCI compliance. The University’s Policy not to store credit card data for any reason in any manner will significantly reduce the University's scope.  All credit card information should be thought of as highly sensitive and "need to know only" information and should be treated as such. Merchants that store, process or transmit cardholder data must be PCI compliant. Each merchant will fall into four merchant levels based on transaction volume. Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 merchant is required to report its compliance status directly to its acquiring bank. The University of Memphis current acquirer has defined the University as a Level 3 merchant.

*Based on the global payment brands standards, VISA and MasterCard have the most stringent requirements for determining Merchant Level. Links to current VISA and MasterCard levels criteria are below:

	Approved departments/activities and their staff must follow procedures approved for their work area to secure any cardholder data in their possession and must adhere to the University’s Cash Handling Guide, Cashier Training Guide and PCI procedures.


C. Masking Data

Any PAN displayed or printed must be masked to display no more than the last four digits.

D. Scanning for Credit Card Data

The University has deployed a software auditing package to perform quarterly scans of University owned systems to ensure that no credit card data is retained on those systems. The software is required to be installed on all local computers and perform scans searching for possible credit card numbers and any results of the scan are logged to a central management console supported by ITS. At no time are the entire contents of any files directly accessible from the management console. The only data stored in the software console are the reported match and the location and name of the file. The following is an overview of the procedures once the quarterly scan has completed.


	Designated personnel will perform a payment card data audit on a quarterly basis.
	Designated personnel will parse the data with a manual review conducted to help eliminate false positives. 
	The designated personnel will provide the results to responsible data stewards, system owners or departments for mitigation of identified risks and will request  the data be reviewed and appropriate action taken within 30 days. 
	The designated personnel will follow up at the end of 30 days if notification of completion has not been received.  If not completed the designated personnel will forward the initial audit discovery to the PCI Compliance Team who will then escalate to the appropriate department leaders for action. 
	After 7 days of escalation and no response will result in the following actions: 
	
		Encryption of file with 256bit AES cypher OR deletion using force methods from ID Finder console
		Notification to VP of Business and Finance, AVP of Finance, Chief Security Officer and CIO of action taken
