                     The time to plan for the future is now. If your student did not do as well academically
                        as he or she had hoped to do during finals, encourage your student to evaluate the
                        year. Look for ways he or she can improve next year.
                     
                     
                     Students should be proud of their accomplishments and use them to motivate themselves
                        as they continue their college career.

                        If your student is enrolled in the summer semester, talk about the importance of effective
                           time management.
                        
                        
                        Encourage your student to keep his or her summer job or internship.
                        
                        Evaluate the need for changes in time management and/or balance of time devoted to
                           school, work and recreation.

                     University of Memphis Creates JD/MPH Degree Program .Â Public health, public policy and issues of health disparities are at the forefront
                        of many of America's unresolved social problems. Rising health care costs pose a growing
                        threat to the economy, while for some access to even the most basic health care is
                        tenuous. Lawyers play a central role in society's approach to these public health
                        issues. However, their effectiveness is frequently limited by an inadequate knowledge
                        of public health matters. To close that educational gap, the University of Memphis
                        has created the JD/MPH program. Read more...

                     STUDY ABROAD
                     
                     Studying abroad can be one of the most rewarding experiences for students. Surprisingly,
                        the experiences and lessons learned from a student's time abroad are very different
                        from what the student had expected prior to their departure. This is one of the reasons
                        study abroad is so challenging and rewarding, but also why students should be fully
                        prepared before embarking on a study abroad trip. We know that parents often have
                        many questions about the process. If you and your student are interested, please click here to read a FAQ for Parents about Study Abroad and its many opportunities .
