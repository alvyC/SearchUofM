                     Living on campus is a game changer.
                     
                     To make the most of your college experience, come live on campus. Not only does it
                        put you in the middle of everything, but research shows that it improves student grades.
                        Carney-Johnston Residence Hall, once the most popular place for Lambuth University
                        students to live, reopened in fall 2013. This historic building, located on the quadrangle
                        between Wilder Student Union and the Athletic Building on the new UofM Lambuth grounds,
                        offers housing for up to 190 students in single and double rooms with suite-style
                        baths. Carney-Johnston's recent upgrades include new fire safety systems, heating
                        and cooling improvements, as well as new paint and carpet in every room. The building
                        is ADA accessible.
                     
                     
                     In addition to separate floors for male and female residents, study lounges on the
                        second floor offer 24-hour access to a quiet study area.  A large living room on the
                        first floor can be used for social activities for Carney-Johnston Hall residents.
