                     Faculty and Staff Resources
                     
                     It's important for our students to see role models who successfully navigated college
                        as first generation students. Faculty and Staff can self-identify as the first in
                        their family to earn a college degree and serve as a role model for students by completing

                     Through the generosity of the Suder Foundation, the University of Memphis has created
                        the First Generation Faculty Advocates Program for the 2015-2016 academic year. The
                        program aims to select faculty from across disciplines to receive professional development
                        training focused on improving learning outcomes for first generation students and
                        share that knowledge with other faculty within their colleges through formalized training
                        sessions. For more information about the First Generation Faculty Advocates Program,
                        please contact Kate Schaffzin , Professor and Director of Faculty Development.
