                     Impact of Federal Tuition Assistance (TA) and/or other Federal Funds on Ch 33 Post
                        9/11 VA Education Benefits
                     
                     
                     If you plan to receive, Federal or State Tuition Assistance (TA) through the military, be aware of the following:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        The Department of Defense no longer authorizes Tuition Assistance for classes in which
                           you are also receiving chapter 1606 and 1607 GI Bill Educational Benefits
                        
                        
                        Chapter 33 recipients may use TA and VA, however, the amount of the tuition and fees
                           reported to the VA will be reduced by the amount of Tuition Assistance received.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Students may not receive Federal Tuition Assistance or other Federal Funds in conjunction
                        with Ch 33 Post 9/11 tuition and fees.
                     
                     
                     The amount that will be reported to the VA will be tuition and fees initially charged
                        to the individual after deducting any amount paid with Federal Funds. Any Federal
                        Funds, excluding Title IV funds, received in excess of tuition and fees will be an
                        overpayment that the student will have to refund to the VA.
