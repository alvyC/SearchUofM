                        children with specific focus on Spanish and English. The Spanish-speaking population
                        is experiencing rapid growth in the Memphis area, resulting in many non-English speaking
                        children entering school. The current line of research is funded by National Institutes
                        of Child Health and Human Development and extends previous efforts by Oller. The focus
                        is on the confluence of literacy and language skills that immigrant elementary school
                        children must master. Phonological research is extensive within the laboratory, but
                        vocabulary knowledge and a variety of other foundations for reading play a role in
                        the research agenda. Both implicit phonological skills and explicit phonological awareness
                        skills are measured and tracked in early elementary school. In addition, participating
                        children are involved in a pre-literacy training program for 12 weeks during the school
                        year. Dr. Buder also plays a significant role in the laboratory's function.
                     
                     
                     Cognition, Language, and Speech Laboratory
                     
                     Directed by Naomi Eichorn, Ph.D., the Cognition, Language, and Speech Laboratory focuses
                        on how cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, interact with speech and
                        language functions. Current research in the lab examines contributions of attention
                        to the occurrence of speech disfluencies and the implications of this relationship
                        for the development and persistence of stuttering.
                     
                     
                     Infant Vocalization Laboratory
                     
                     Directed by D. Kimbrough Oller, Ph.D. and Eugene Buder, Ph.D., the Infant Vocalization Laboratory is dedicated to research in infant vocal development and young child phonology. The
                        laboratory continues a line of work that the primary director, Oller, has pursued
                        for over 30 years under funding from the National Institutes of Deafness and other
                        Communication Disorders (the current primary funding agency for the laboratory), the
                        National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Institutes
                        of Mental Health, as well as a variety of private sources including, currently, the
                        Plough Foundation. The laboratory is co-directed by Dr. Buder and is also utilized
                        by Dr. Linda Jarmulowicz.
                     
                     
                      
                           
                     
                     Language Acquisition Laboratory
                     
                     Directed by Linda D. Jarmulowicz, Ph.D., this laboratory explores typical and atypical
                        language development in preschool and school-aged children.  Current areas of study
                        include lexical and phonological development and the relationship between oral language
                        and literacy. Of particular interest is the intersection of derivational morphology
                        with lexical, phonological, prosodic, and literacy factors.
                     
                     
                     Social Interaction Laboratory
                     
                     The social interaction laboratory, directed by Eugene H. Buder, Ph.D, is a specialized
                        facility designed to support this focus area by acquiring video, audio, and physiological
                        data from two persons engaged in conversation. The facility can be used for a variety
                        of purposes, and has supported research in conversational management by persons with
                        aphasia and persons who stutter, as well as collaborations in the areas of social
                        psychology and discourse analysis. Buder's particular interest is in understanding
                        how the dynamics of rhythmic and melodic aspects of speech behaviors support communicative
                        coordination.
