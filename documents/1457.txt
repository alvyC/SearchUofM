                     E. Dual-Degree Programs
                     
                     Highly motivated and talented students may pursue an undergraduate degree (B.S.) in
                        Physics followed by a graduate (M.S.) in either Physics or Biomedical Engineering
                        in a special five-year program. This option requires serious commitment, careful planning
                        with the student's advisor, and summer research work leading toward a Master's thesis.
                        Students interested in pursuing this option should contact an undergraduate advisor
                        in the Physics and Materials Science department.
                     
                     
                     F. Second Major for Engineering Students
                     
                     A total of twenty-nine (29) semester hours beyond PHYS 2110/2111 and PHYS 2120/2121,
                        many of which will count toward the engineering degree or are already required by
                        the engineering major. Since Biomedical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, and Mechanical
                        engineering students take different courses to satisfy their degree requirements,
                        the program for the second major in physics is different for each engineering discipline.
                        For details, please contact the Department of Physics and Materials Science or the

                     Â  G. Second Major for the Bachelor of Science Degree
                     
                     A total of twenty-nine (29) semester hours beyond PHYS 2110/2111 and PHYS 2120/2121,
                        many of which are already required by the primary major. Since the students in each
                        B.S. degree-granting department take different courses to satisfy their degree requirements,
                        the program for the second major in Physics is different for each discipline. For
                        details, please contact the Department of Physics and Materials ScienceÂ  or check

                     Honors Program
                     
                     This program is open to physics majors who maintain a grade point average of at least
                        3.25, both overall and in physics, have achieved junior standing, and have completed
                        PHYS 3060. Students admitted to the honors program must complete 8 hours of upper-division
                        physics honors courses: (1) PHYS 4991/4992 Honors Research in Physics, where the student
                        will conduct original scholarly work under the direction of an honors research advisor;
                        (2) PHYS 4999 Senior Honors Thesis, where the student will write a thesis based upon
                        background reading and the experimental research completed in PHYS 4991/4992; (3)
                        PHYS 4911 Senior Honors Seminar, where the student will give a presentation based
                        on the work completed in PHYS 4991/4992.
                     
                     
                     Those students who complete the physics honors program and the regular college requirements
                        will be recognized at the commencement ceremony by having their degree conferred "With
                        Honors in Physics." Moreover, the student's diploma and record at the University of
                        Memphis will reflect this distinction.
                     
                     
                     Accelerated B.S./M.S. Program in Physics
                     
                     This program allows outstanding undergraduates to begin the coursework for the Master
                        of Science inÂ Physics during their senior year. Students are encouraged to begin planning
                        to enter the Accelerated B.S./M.S. program early in their undergraduate career, in
                        consultation with their advisor in the Department of Physics and Materials Science.
                     
                     
                     Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates
                        selected into this program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow
                        them to complete their B.S. degree while they also begin the coursework toward their
                        M.S.
                     
                     
                     To apply, students must have a minimum 3.25 grade point average, and must submit two
                        reference letters and a copy of their transcript to the Department of Physics and
                        Materials Science department. Each applicant will complete an interview with the graduate
                        academic coordinator in physics.
                     
                     
                     Students must also apply to the Graduate School for the accelerated B.S./M.S. program,
                        which allows them to take graduate courses in physics. To continue in the program
                        past the B.S., students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School and
                        into the M.S. program of the Department of Physics and Materials Science.
                     
                     
                     Only in ABM programs, up to 9 hours of graduate course work may be applied to both
                        the undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not
                        apply to undergraduate GPA.
