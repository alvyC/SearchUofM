                     The value of your legal education at the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys
                        School of Law compares very favorably with that available at other state-assisted
                        and private institutions. University tuition and fees are determined by the Tennessee
                        Board of Regents and are subject to change each year.

                     Border Counties Tuition Waiver
                     
                     In an effort to accommodate students from neighboring counties, the University of
                        Memphis School of Law will consider qualified non-resident students as border county
                        residents for purposes of admission and tuition. To qualify for the Border County
                        Tuition Waiver, students must document their permanent residence in one of the five
                        counties listed below. This tuition waiver is determined primarily from information
                        provided on the application for admission to the law school. The School of Law Admissions
                        Office may require applicants to submit additional documentation. Questions about
                        eligibility for the Border County Tuition Waiver should be directed to the Law School
                        Admissions Office.
                     
                     
                     Eligible Counties include: Crittenden County, Arkansas and Desoto, Marshall, Tate
                        & Tunica Counties in Mississippi
                     
                     
                     Note: Students on non-immigrant visas are not eligible for the Border County Tuition

                     Confirmation
                     
                     Applicants selected for the entering class will be extended an offer of acceptance
                        in writing. Applicants who choose to accept the offer must confirm their acceptance
                        by April 13th or, in the case of an applicant who is accepted after April 1, within
                        two weeks of receipt of notification. A $250 seat deposit is required of all accepted
                        students regardless of residency. $200 of the deposit is applied towards fall tuition
                        and $50 is an orientation fee. This deposit is non refundable.
                     
                     
                     An applicant who does not confirm and/or pay the seat deposit within the deadline
                        specified in the acceptance letter will forfeit his or her seat in the entering class.
                     
                     
                     A mandatory orientation and registration program for entering students is held each
                        fall prior to the beginning of classes. Details concerning the orientation session
                        are sent to accepted students in late spring.
