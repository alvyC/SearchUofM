                     2016 SUMMER EXTERNSHIPS 
                     
                     During the Summer 2016 semester, 50 University of Memphis School of Law students are
                        enrolled in the externship course, simultaneously earning academic credit and gaining
                        valuable hands-on legal experience through field placement work performed under the
                        supervision of federal and state judges on the appellate and trial court levels; federal
                        and state attorneys' and public defenders' offices; federal and state government and
                        administrative agencies; an educational institution; healthcare entities; and non-profit
                        legal services providers.
                     
                     
                     "By taking advantage of the law school's experiential learning course offerings, including
                        our field-based externships and in-house, live-client clinics, Memphis Law students
                        move beyond the foundation of core doctrinal courses and immerse themselves in supervised
                        legal activities designed to further develop essential lawyering skills and professional
                        values," said Daniel Schaffzin, Assistant Professor of Law and Director of Experiential
                        Learning. "Students emerge from experiential courses that much more ready to practice
                        law and to meet the rightfully high expectations of the future clients and employers
                        on whose behalf they will work following graduation."
                     
                     
                     "I highly recommend the externship course at the University of Memphis because it
                        provides a necessary exposure to 'real world lawyering' beyond the walls of the law
                        school building," said Bob Huddleston, a rising 3L student, who is a summer extern
                        with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Hearings Unit in Memphis. "An externship
                        provides insight into practical lawyering skills by showing how the substantive material
                        learned in the traditional classroom translates into day-to-day legal practice. Additionally,
                        the contacts, connections, and mentoring relationships made while working alongside
                        supervising judges and practitioners serve the extern well in his or her future career,
                        and, even better, are rewarding on a purely personal level." As part of the Summer 2016 externship course, Memphis Law students are gaining for-credit
