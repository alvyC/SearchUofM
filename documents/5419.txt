                           12. MOST HAPPENSTANCE ACCOMPLISHMENT.  In a 1970 discussion at the  Vanderbilt Afro
                              House I was trying to make a point. I wanted to use an example which I had learned
                              in Middle Eastern History Class from the professor Dr. Drew about the camel getting
                              his nose in the tent, but I decided to modify and update it, so I talked about ignoring
                              an elephant that got into your living room. It soon became popular on campus and thirty
                              years later it started popping up in debates all over the country.
                           
                           
                           13.  PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS, [A Personal Statement]
                           
                           I am most proud of the fact that God blessed me to be able to help tend to both of
                              my elderly parents during the final years of their lives; that I was able to help
                              my wife at the time through her last years of college and graduate school; that I
                              was able to attend every athletic contest, recital and program of my two sons, my
                              nephew [3rd son], and my niece, as well as the fact that I was able do something every
                              week with these children while they were growing up; that I was always there for my
                              true friends; that every semester I am able to use my education, training, and experience
                              to guide a few students past the facades of life to see how law, business, society,
                              and politics truly operate in the world; that I have created a small body of scholarly
                              and artistic work that might have some long term merit; and finally that I was able
                              to contribute in a small way toward the peaceful integration of the south.
