Battery life will vary depending on how the  Microsoft Band  is used, as some features use more battery than others like GPS.

USER NOTE:  Microsoft Band  will reach a full charge in approximately 90 minutes, and can reach nearly 80% within 30 minutes of charging. It’s recommend that the user charge the  Microsoft Band  during routine periods of downtime.

            Important        
            
                Always use this Microsoft Band setup process to set up and pair your Microsoft Band with your phone, rather than only using your phone’s Bluetooth settings to pair them. 

Why? Bluetooth settings in your phone only pair your band, but don’t register your band to the Microsoft Health app on your phone and don’t associate it with your Microsoft account in the cloud. Microsoft Band needs these things to work correctly.

				Microsoft Band is available in sizes small, medium, or large. The sizing is not a matter of fashion or personal comfort. It is important for proper device  functionality.  Features such as heart rate tracking are designed to work with the best accuracy under the condition of a good fit.  The band should be snug but not too tight.

				Health Dashboard 
				In order to use the Microsoft Band, you must have a Health Dashboard account. This is where you will log your information and keep track of your results.
			
                            
                                
                                
			
				You will need to set up your account. In order to do that, you will use an email address, create a password and have a code texted to your phone in order to verify that you have included your correct information. This is a security measure.

 

Once you have set up your account and logged in, you will go to your Dashboard. That will look like this:
