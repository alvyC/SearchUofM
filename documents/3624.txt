                     MEDIATION CLINIC
                     
                     Guided by Professor Steve Shields, a Rule 31 Listed Mediator and Tennessee Supreme
                        Court Approved Rule 31 Trainer, students in the Mediation Clinic will study mediation
                        from the inside-out, analyzing in detail the communicative, strategic, and ethical
                        dimensions of specific interventions that mediators make in the context of particular
                        cases. \
                     
                     
                     The Clinic will primarily focus on the students as the mediators, but the students
                        will also be asked to consider the issues from other points of view: as the disputant,
                        as an attorney representing a client in mediation, and in the capacity of advising
                        an organizational client about dispute resolution options. The Clinic will have four
                        primary components: (1) the training that is required by Tennessee Supreme Court Rule
                        31 before one may become listed as a Rule 31 Mediator; (2) ongoing student observation
                        of mediations conducted by Rule 31 Mediators in General Sessions Court cases, Federal
                        Court cases, and EEOC administrative proceedings; (3) student participation as co-mediator
                        with Rule 31 Mediators in Shelby County General Sessions Court cases; and (4) weekly
                        classroom seminar and case rounds designed to give students further training and feedback
                        throughout the course of the semester.
