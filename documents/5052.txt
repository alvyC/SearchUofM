                     Clients are seen by appointment only.
                     
                     Speech-Language: An evaluation will be scheduled first to determine if there is a
                        communication problem. A recommendation will be made at that time for follow-up services.
                        Children under the age of 4 years will be scheduled for a full hearing evaluation
                        prior to a speech and language evaluation. Individuals who have recently been evaluated
                        by a speech-language pathologist may submit the reports and be considered for admission
                        straight to therapy without repeating the testing.
                     
                     
                     Audiology: An evaluation may be necessary first to determine your hearing sensitivity
                        and assess your communication needs. Hearing aid consultations, auditory processing
                        evaluation or other types of appointments are available. Returning hearing aid clients
                        have the option to attend one of our on-call clinics on Thursday from 1:00-4:00 pm.
                     
                     
                     Working hours are 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday through Friday. Appointments can be made
                        between 8:00 am and 4:30 pm To schedule an appointment, please call 901.678.5858.
                     
                     
                     Fees/Insurance
                     
                     Fees for the initial evaluation and treatment programs vary according to the nature
                        of the problem and the type of services required. A payment plan is available upon
                        request. At this time we are not a provider for most private insurance companies,
                        therefore, payment is the client's responsibility. We are required to have a copy
                        of insurance cards on file for audit purposes. The business office personnel will
                        assist the client to file insurance claims if needed.
                     
                     
                     The Client Assistance Program, established with a seed grant by the Center's Board
                        of Directors, offers qualified clients assistance with a portion of their expenses
                        incurred at our Center.
