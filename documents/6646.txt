                        About Dr. Mandel
                        
                        Dr. Mandel joined the department in 2014. She received a B.A. from Carson Newman University
                           with a focus in organismal biology, ecology, and natural history. Her Ph.D work involved
                           plant conservation and evolutionary genetics both in rare, endangered species as well
                           as weedy, invasives. Following this, her post-doctoral research at The University
                           of Georgia was aimed at identifying the genetic basis of evolutionary and agronomically
                           important traits in cultivated sunflower. Her research at the UofM includes plant
                           population and quantitative genetics, evolutionary genetics, and phylogenetics. She
                           employs field, laboratory, and greenhouse approaches to gain an understanding of the
                           processes and mechanisms that lead to the genetic, phenotypic, and ecological diversity
                           we see in the world. Courses taught include Ecological Genetics 7795/8705 and Plant
                           Ecology 4053/6053.
