                     Princeton Review Lists UofM Among Most Environmentally Responsible Colleges
                     
                     May 21, 2015 - The Princeton Review has named the University of Memphis as one of
                        the most environmentally responsible colleges in the United States and Canada. The
                        education services company known for its test prep programs and college rankings,
                        ratings and guidebooks profiles the U of M in the fifth annual edition of its free
                        downloadable book, The Princeton Review's Guide to 353 Green Colleges .
                     
                     
                     After a review of 2,000 colleges, the Princeton Review chose schools for the guide
                        that offer an enhanced student experience through academics and green campus initiatives.
                        The institutional survey included questions about course offerings, campus infrastructure,
                        activities and career preparation.
                     
                     
                     The UofM's green initiatives include the Tiger Bike Share Program, with a fleet of
                        80 bicycles for rent by students, faculty and staff. There also are six bottle refill
                        hydration stations across campus.
                     
                     
                     Recycling on campus has taken new strides by going single stream. The University's
                        recycling program started in 2009 with a total of 150,000 pounds for the entire year.
                        This year, the total of recycling should surpass 1 million pounds. The annual Tiger
                        Blue Goes Green Day spotlights the many eco-friendly initiatives developed by the
                        University and the surrounding community.
                     
                     
                     "I am truly proud of what our University has accomplished thus far in sustainability,"
                        said Amelia Mayahi, sustainability coordinator. "So many faculty, staff, students
                        and individuals in the community have stepped forward and donated their time to help
                        our program succeed. I have traveled to many universities that have outstanding sustainability
                        programs, which have been created over several years. So to know that our campus is
                        relatively new to the sustainability scene and we are already a leader in so many
                        areas is truly amazing."
                     
                     
                     The Princeton Review created its Guide to 353 Green Colleges in partnership with the Center for Green Schools at the U.S. Green Building Council
                        (USGBC).
