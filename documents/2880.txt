        The  GSIS 30th Anniversary Founders' Scholarship 
    


        Since 1986, the Governor's School for International Studies (GSIS) at the University of Memphis has afforded the best and brightest students in high schools across the state of Tennessee to receive, free of charge, an opportunity for a four-week immersion in international studies.   The program challenges students to look beyond the boundaries Tennessee and the U.S., to explore how international finance, world history, and cultural relationships affect us.
The 2017 summer program will mark the 30th anniversary of the GSIS program at the University of Memphis.  In celebration of this anniversary and to honor the program's founders and leaders, the University of Memphis GSIS program is committed to funding the GSIS 30th Anniversary Founders' Scholarship.  This scholarship will allow a GSIS alumnus to further his or her education in International Studies at the U of M.  Our $3500 goal seeks to fund scholarships for several years, but any funds received will be used to provide financial assistance to GSIS alums.
Blanche Deaderick,  Ruth Dunning, Sue Gilmore, and Rejane Roe have been the glue that has held the GSIS program together for the past thirty years.  They commit one month each summer to literally spending twenty-four hours a day with the GSIS students.  They have helped countless students form life-long bonds and memories in through countless GSIS classes, activities and experiences.  Thousands of students and parents have benefitted from their life-long commitment to education, the personal success of students, and community service.  There is no better way to honor Blanche, Ruth, Sue, and Rejane than by giving a GSIS student the opportunity to further his or her international studies at the U of M through a gift to the GSIS 30th Anniversary Founders' Fund.
