                        Studies degree from the Candler School of Theology at Emory. He is currently a Ph.D.
                        candidate in Emory University’s Graduate Division of Religion, where he specializes
                        in the History of Christianity in Early Modern Europe.  “Thanks to generous support from FedEx, the Hyde Family Foundations, and DuPont Corporation,
                        these valuable historical documents will be more accessible to students and researchers
                        throughout the world,” said Daphene R. McFerren, director of the Hooks Institute.
                        “We are excited to begin the digitization process that will soon enable others to
                        continue Dr. Hooks’ legacy of social change.” In 1996, University of Memphis officials
                        received approval from the Tennessee Board of Regents to create the Benjamin L. Hooks
                        Institute for Social Change in the College of Arts & Sciences. The mission of the
                        Institute is teaching, studying and promoting civil rights and social change. The
                        Hooks Institute archives include Hooks’ personal papers, which are housed in the Preservation
                        and Special Collections Department in the University’s McWherter Library.
