                     I received a citation. How do I pay for it? Can I appeal it? What if I need an accessible/disability placard? Can I get a refund on my priority parking permit? 
                         May I sell my permit? What if my permit is lost or stolen?  Why do we have to pay to park?  How do I obtain a parking permit or a semester validation sticker?  How can I pay for the permit?
                     
                       I received a citation. How do I pay for it? Can I appeal it?
                     
                     You may mail in your payment using the addressed envelope you received with your citation

                       What if I need an accessible/disability placard?
                     
                     Designated accessible parking areas are available to persons with physical disabilities
                        who have a registered University of Memphis parking permit and a valid disabled parking
                        permit issued to the student or employee by a State Department of Safety. No additional
                        fee will be assessed to STUDENTS for physically disabled parking permits. The priority
                        parking permit fee will be assessed to FACULTY/STAFF for physically disabled parking
                        permits. This permit authorizes the permit holder to park in accessible parking spaces
                        in priority parking lots and in other non-reserved, general permit parking spaces
                        on campus.
                     
                     
                       Can I get a refund on my priority parking permit?
                     
                     A refund for priority parking will not be issued after the first day of class.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                       May I sell my permit?
                     
                     No. The permit is the property of the University of Memphis and cannot be reissued or resold. We do not register vehicle license plates. We register the
                        University of Memphis permit (hang-tag) to your student account so you have the freedom
                        to switch vehicles. Any citations received on this permit (hang-tag) will be the responsibility
                        of the permit holder. If you are no longer in need of your permit (hang-tag), please
                        discard or return it to the Parking Office.
                     
                     
                       What if my permit is lost or stolen? 
                     
                     A lost or stolen permit must be reported to the Parking Office as soon as possible
                        and a replacement permit may be purchased for a $10.00 fee. The permit will then be
                        entered into our system as lost or stolen, so anyone who uses that permit will be
                        ticketed and/or towed.
                     
                     
                       Why do we have to pay to park?
                     
                     Parking & Transportation Services is an auxiliary unit within the Office of Business
                        Services. This means that the department must pay for itself. Parking fees, citation
                        revenue, meter revenue, and garage revenue provide the funds to pay for debt costs,
                        operational costs, maintenance and construction projects.
                     
                     
                       How do I obtain a parking permit or a semester validation sticker? 
                     
                     If the student registers prior to late registration then a semester validation sticker
                        will be mailed to the address of the student which is downloaded directly from the
                        Records Department. If the student does not have a current permit in our database
                        then a permit is also mailed along with the validation sticker. If the student does
                        not receive their permit or semester validation sticker by the first day of classes,
                        he/she must come to the Parking Office to obtain one. New employees must come the
                        Parking Office to purchase parking.
                     
                     
                       How can I pay for the permit? 
                     
                     General Parking permits for students are included in the student's maintenance fees
                        and are mailed to the home address, as a courtesy, to those students that register
                        for class before the mail out deadline posted on our website prior to each term. Priority
                        or Resident Parking must be purchased online through Tigerpark . Online purchases can be made using Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express
                        or electronic check. Faculty/Staff must pay for parking in the Parking & Transportation
                        Services office and may pay with cash, check, or credit card or by payroll deduction.
