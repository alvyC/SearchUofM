                        study habits, self-management, and decision-making skills that increase retention
                        and graduation rates for college students. The Center for Academic Retention and Enrichment

                        to partner with them in reaching their academic goals.

                        time management, and developing strategies and action plans for personal and academic
                        success of college students. CARES Counselors and Academic Coaches work closely with
                        faculty and departments to refer students to the University's support services as
                        appropriate to the individual student's needs.
                     
                     
                     Academic Support
                     
                     CARES maintains study and computer labs to provide academic enrichment and support
                        to students to augment classroom instruction. CARES students are strongly encouraged
                        to spend time in the CARES support labs as part of their academic requirements. In
                        addition the CARES support personnel counsels and/or refers students to other campus
                        services for assistance.
                     
                     
                     Academic Success Seminar (ACAD 2200)
                     
                     Students who are on Academic Probation are required to enroll in a one-hour course,
                        ACAD 2200: Academic Success Seminar, and work with a Retention Counselor from the
                        Center for Academic Retention and Enrichment Services. The goals of these activities
                        are to help the student introspectively identify the barriers to their success and
                        to help the student avoid Academic Suspension. The course is taught by CARES Retention
                        Counselors.
                     
                     
                     Early Intervention Reporting
                     
                     The Early Intervention Program at The University of Memphis is committed to the success
                        of all students. It was instituted as a means to inform and focus on students who
                        may be experiencing academic or personal difficulties and provide available campus
                        resources to help ensure their best chance for success in their coursework. An integral
                        part of the Early Intervention Program is the facilitation of a communication loop
                        between divisions, departments, programs, advisors and faculty to effectively intervene
                        when a student is at risk of failing their academic courses. The Center for Academic
                        Retention and Enrichment Services is responsible for administrative oversight of this
                        program.
                     
                     
                     Academic Fresh Start
                     
                     An Academic Fresh Start is a plan of academic forgiveness provided for undergraduate
                        students who have gained maturity through extended experience outside higher education
                        institutions and have demonstrated better than average academic performance following
                        their return to the University of Memphis. It allows for the calculation of the applicant's
                        grade point average and credit hours toward graduation to be based only on work completed
                        after returning to college. This Tennessee Board of Regents policy is administered
                        at the University of Memphis by the Center for Academic Retention and Enrichment Services.
                     
                     
                     Student Progress Reporting
                     
                     Through various mediums, including personal meetings, email reporting, Skype and telephone
                        appointments, CARES Counselors and Academic Coaches interface on an ongoing basis
                        with students who are on Academic Warning, continuing on Academic Probation or returning
                        from Academic Suspension. Together, the Counselor/Coach and student will discuss the
                        student's academic progress, upcoming academic work, study skills, time management
                        strategies and other life situations that might potentially impede the student's academic
                        success.
