                     The Fogelman College of Business & Economics offers over 75 different private scholarships
                        to declared business majors totaling over $300,000. These scholarships are available
                        to incoming freshmen, transfer, continuing, graduate, and doctoral students each year.
                        All FCBE scholarships are awarded for the academic year (fall and spring semesters
                        only).
                     
                     
                     Students are able to apply for two different types of scholarships, general business
                        scholarships and departmental scholarships. We encourage students to apply for both
                        types of scholarships as many high ability students are awarded scholarships from
                        both categories. Please note that all scholarships within the Fogelman College of
                        Business and Economics can be awarded in addition to any scholarship you may receive
                        from the University.

                     General Business Scholarships
                     
                     General business scholarships are available for all declared business majors, regardless
                        of academic major concentration. The awards amounts for these scholarships often vary
                        from year to year and include both one time awards and four year awards. General business
                        scholarships can be both merit based and/or need based.  
                     
                     Departmental Scholarships
                     
                     Departmental scholarships are available for students with a declared major in that
                        particular department. All students must have officially declared their business major
                        by the scholarship deadline of a future date to be determined. Departmental scholarships
                        are awarded based on the criteria set forth by the scholarship donor and the department’s
                        scholarship committee. Like general business scholarships, departmental scholarships
                        awards amounts often vary from year to year and include both one time awards and four
                        year awards. Departmental scholarships can be both merit based and/or need based.
