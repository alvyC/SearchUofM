The ACSA International Cotton Institute is a six week residential program designed to provide a basic
  education in all aspects of the cotton industry and the international business environment for men and women
  worldwide. From field to fabric, to manual classing and the use of HVI data, through risk management and
the basics of price protection - the program offers an in-depth look at cotton from virtually every perspective. 
Dramatic changes in cotton's production, processing, classification, transportation, and manufacturing
technologies; and the continuing evolution of new trade patterns brought about by the expansion of free
trade in cotton in South and Central America, Eastern Europe, and Central and Southeast Asia require expanded
educational programs for those involved in all facets of the cotton industry in both the producing and consuming
nations of the world. 
The 2017 International Cotton Institute will be held at the Fogelman Executive Conference Center and Hotel on the 
grounds of the University of Memphis. When not attending lectures or classing cotton, participants can retreat to the fourth floor commons area. 
The hotel commons area is complete with fireplace, board games and television, and kitchen. Each guest room is equipped with a private bath, queen-sized bed, 19” television with remote, work desk with modem ports, and private balcony.
