                     Our Graduate assistantship consists of a full waiver of tuition and fees, plus a living
                        expense stipend. The full assistantship requires that each student work 20 hours in
                        one of following areas: scenic production, lighting & sound production, costume construction,
                        publicity or teaching Introduction to Theatre.
                     
                     
                     The Job: Each student will be assigned to a production area related to their field or to an
                        area of interest. All areas ask that the Graduate Assistant help supervise and teach
                        undergraduate laboratory students. This arrangement allows the GA to begin teaching
                        before entering the classroom environment. Also, it provides the opportunity to practice
                        one's skills and pass them on to another theatre artist. We do not require you to
                        be an expert in your assigned area, only that you be willing to learn.
                     
                     
                     Scenic Production: A GA working in the area of scenic production will be asked to build, paint and rig
                        scenery as well as help our lab students who are learning to do the same. We work
                        every weekday afternoon and the occasional Saturday (for special needs such as floor
                        paint). One person in this area is chosen to oversee the properties area for the season.
                     
                     
                     Costume Construction: The Costume Shop is open weekday mornings and afternoons. GAs in this area mostly
                        build costumes for productions, but may also be responsible for alterations from general
                        stock and fittings. Some may be assigned to millenry & crafts. Costume GAs also assist
                        designers during dress parade.
                     
                     
                     Lighting & Sound Production: The GAs in this area oversee all aspects of light hangs, sound rig and set up as well
                        as daily maintenance of lighting systems and projects. Lighting & sound GAs work Monday
                        through Thursday weekly, and cover technical rehearsals and light hang on selected
                        weekends.
                     
                     
                     Promotion and Publicity: A GA in this area would act as an assistant to the Promotion & Publicity Director.
                        This includes creating show posters and other promotional devices and press releases.
                        The job also entails overseeing box office operations, house management and ushers
                        and being the department tour guide.
                     
                     
                     Introduction to Theatre Instructor: A GA in this area would teach two sections of Introduction to Theatre (or related
                        introductory level courses) each semester, after first shadowing a faculty professor
                        the previous term to acquire teaching skills. They are the teachers of record, solely
                        responsible for lectures, discussions, exams and grading their classes, performing
                        all the duties and responsibilities of a professor.
