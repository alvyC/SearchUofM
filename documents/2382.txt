                     About Herff College of Engineering
                     
                     Welcome to the Herff College of Engineering (HCOE), a place where we can help you
                        achieve your dreams!
                     
                     
                     Imagine a college that impacts the quality of life throughout an entire region. That
                        is what we strive to do at the Herff College of Engineering. We impact our region
                        and beyond in a myriad of ways such as developing new biomedical devices or saving
                        energy by improving transportation efficiency. We also impact the individual lives
                        of our students when we prepare them for successful and rewarding careers. These careers
                        encompass the traditional areas of engineering and technology. However, many of our
                        graduates go on to excel in business, law, medicine, education, and public service
                        as well. 
                     
                     
                     Since offering its first classes in 1964, Herff College has developed a reputation
                        for excellent instruction. Over 50 dedicated faculty members with outstanding academic
                        and professional credentials comprise the College enabling us to offer a variety of
                        undergraduate and graduate degree programs. All undergraduate programs are accredited
                        by the Engineering Accreditation Commission or the Engineering Technology Accreditation
                        Commission of ABET, Inc. This is the recognized U.S. accreditor of college and university
                        programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and technology ( http://www.abet.org ). Accreditation ensures the quality of the education our students receive, and this
                        is important to job placement and the ability to compete for the best engineering
                        jobs.
                     
                     
                     As you are searching for a place to obtain an exceptional education that will prepare
                        you for a lifetime of work bringing the fruits of technology to people, please spend
                        some time with us, whether by visiting campus or exploring this site. You will learn
                        about our nearly 20 degree programs and many exciting activities and services that
                        enrich or smooth the path to an engineering degree.
