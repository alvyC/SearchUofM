                     Prospective students should check with the coordinator of the program to which they
                              are applying for specific deadlines and requirements. Applicants should allow a reasonable
                              amount of time for necessary documents to be processed by the degree program and the
                              Graduate School (approximately four to six weeks). International applicants should
                              allow at least four months for the application process. Applicants are urged to apply
                              early to ensure consideration. Contact the ICL department about any requirements and
                              deadlines.
                     
                     If you have previously attended The University of Memphis Graduate School and have
                              not been enrolled for a semester, excluding summer, you must apply for readmission.
                              Readmission may subject the student to all of the rules, prerequisites, and degree
                              requirements listed in the current Graduate Catalog. Submission of an application
                              for readmission does not ensure acceptance. Readmission may be denied or conditions
                              may be imposed on the student. Contact the Graduate Office of Admissions and follow the specified procedures.
