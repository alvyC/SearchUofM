                     What is a Learning Community?
                     
                     At the University of Memphis, a learning community is a group of 20-30 first semester
                        freshman enrolled in a group of three to four courses. Specially selected faculty
                        work within the community to engage students in learning inside and outside of the
                        classroom. Smaller class sizes allow for close collaboration between students and
                        their professors. This helps to create a comfortable and inclusive environment where
                        active learning can take place.
                     
                     
                     There are a wide variety of learning communities to choose from - some focused on
                        specific majors and some that include people from many different majors. So no matter
                        what your major is, there is a community that can work for you! Each community has
                        an ACAD 1100 course or a Freshman Seminar, general education courses, and/or major-required
                        courses. Many communities also have guest speakers that come in to speak on special
                        topics.
                     
                     
                     In addition, students in learning communities interact more outside of the classroom
                        helping to foster stronger long lasting relationships. Many students form study groups
                        and attend various campus events together. There are also formal activities planned
                        for each community. In the past these activities have included tours of the Stax Museum,
