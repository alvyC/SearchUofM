                        Academic Summary
                        
                        Loel Kim is an associate professor in the Department of English, teaching in the professional
                           writing program. She also directs the Center for the Study of Rhetoric and Applied
                           Communication (CSRAC). Her research encompasses aspects of the social and cognitive
                           factors involved in collaborative settings, particularly those that are electronically
                           created, such as online and multimodal environments. A recent study develops a profile
                           of student technology use in a learning community. Most recently, her research has
                           focused on healthcare professionals and patients engaged in the informed consent process
                           at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. With an interdisciplinary team of researchers
                           and designers, Loel is looking at developing usability methodology for using focus
                           groups data to inform user-centered interactive systems design.
