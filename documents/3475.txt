                     Scholarship Service Hour Requirement Options
                     
                     As a scholarship student at the University of Memphis, you are required to perform
                        a certain number of service hours in order to keep your scholarship. Our office has
                        developed this sheet to give you a list of options that you have to complete your
                        service hours. Our office will need official verification from your site supervisor
                        that you have completed your service hours. The service hour verification letter should
                        be on official letterhead, signed by your site supervisor, who may not be a related
                        party or yourself, and must include the following: Your UID number, name, total hours
                        volunteered, a brief summary of your responsibilities, and your site supervisor’s
                        contact information. Service hours must be completed during the academic year in which
                        the scholarship award is received. Verification of service hours is due by June 1st of each academic year. Note: hours in excess of your scholarship requirement do not
                        carry forward. Scholarships will not be renewed for the upcoming school year until
                        service hour completion is verified and appropriate supporting documentation is received
                        by the Scholarship Office.

                        the following methods. Active participation for service hour fulfillment means completing
                        two (2) three-hour Honors courses per year, earning a grade no lower than a B, completing
                        an approved Honors Experience (i.e., undergraduate research/internship, graduate course,
                        honors directed study etc.) or contracting for Honors credit and satisfactorily completing
                        the Honors contract work while earning a grade of A or B. Each Honors course taken
                        completes one semester's requirement (75 hours) for service hours (i.e. two Honors
                        courses completed per year fulfills your service requirement of 150 hours). Grades
                        of B- or lower will not satisfy the service hour requirement. For more information
