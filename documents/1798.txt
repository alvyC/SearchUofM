                     UofM Physicist Xiao Shen Receives Prestigious Early Career Research Award
                     
                     June 17, 2016- Dr. Xiao Shen, assistant professor of Physics and Materials Science
                        at the University of Memphis, has been named a winner of the 2016 Ralph E. Powe Junior
                        Faculty Enhancement Award by Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) for his work
                        on novel optical materials.
                     
                     
                     This highly competitive $5,000 matching award is given annually to select faculty
                        during the first two years of their initial university appointment to support promising
                        new lines of research and promote collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory
                        researchers. Shen was one of 35 recipients selected from 132 candidates nominated
                        by ORAU members. He is only the second UofM faculty member to receive this award.
                     
                     
                     Shen's research focuses on theory and computation of a range of materials for electronics,
                        optoelectronics and energy. His Powe Award project will explore structural and optical
                        properties of a novel two-dimensional material, Si2Te3, with practical applications
                        for advanced electronic devices. He will collaborate with Dr. Matthew Chisholm, group
                        leader of the Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy team at Oak Ridge National
                        Laboratory.
                     
                     
                     This one-year award will help Shen further his research and support future proposals
                        to federal agencies such as the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department
                        of Energy.
                     
                     
                     "This is a great honor for Dr. Shen and the work he is doing here and validates the
                        quality of the superb young faculty who are joining us at the University of Memphis,"
                        said vice president for Research Andrew Meyers.
                     
                     
                     Shen earned his PhD in physics from the State University of New York at Stony Brook
                        and completed a post-doctoral research appointment at Vanderbilt University prior
                        to joining the UofM faculty last August.
