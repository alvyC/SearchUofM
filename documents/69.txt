                     Welcome from the Vice Provost at UofM Lambuth!
                     
                     As the Vice Provost, I invite you to visit our historical and residential campus in
                        Jackson, Tennessee. Offering  students the perfect collegiate setting on 57 acres
                        in midtown Jackson, UofM Lambuth is classified as an arboretum and displays year-round
                        beauty. In addition to over 20 undergraduate majors and minors, students can also
                        obtain a variety of master's or doctorate degrees. Living on campus in historic Carney-Johnston
                        Hall or commuting from home, students can find a number of organizations in which
                        to be involved including fraternity or sorority affairs, club sports, intramural activities,
                        or registered student organizations such as Tiger Leadership Institute that offer
                        leadership benefits. It's not uncommon to see students reading or listening to music
