                     Each student is assigned a Graduation Analyst within his or her college or school.
                        The Graduation Analyst will receive your application for graduation and check your
                        status and ensure you are enrolled in the correct number of hours for the term in
                        which you have filed to graduate. If you are enrolled in the correct number of hours,
                        you will be approved at the beginning of your final semester. If you you are not enrolled
                        in your final coursework, you may be listed as ineligible or disqualified for for
                        the term. You will need to speak to your Graduation Analyst and change your date to
                        a future term. In addition to the emails you will receive from the Commencement Office,
                        you will also receive emails and communication from your college/Graduation Analyst.
