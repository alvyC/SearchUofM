                     2016 CLEA AWARD
                     
                     University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law recent graduate Jeffrey T.
                        Slack (JD '16) was recently awarded the Clinical Legal Education Association (CLEA)
                        Outstanding Student Award. Jeff was a student in both the Neighborhood Preservation
                        Clinic during the Fall 2015 semester and the Elder Law Clinic in the Spring 2016 semester.
                     
                     
                     CLEA recognizes law students who have excelled in clinical fieldwork in law school
                        by providing high quality representation to clients, and who have engaged in exceptionally
                        thoughtful, self-reflective participation in an accompanying clinical seminar. The
                        award is based on excellence in case work and the quality and extent of the student's
                        contribution to the clinical community at his law school. Bill was lauded for, among
                        other things, his ability to set the pace and the standard for his colleagues in his
                        diligence, preparation, thoughtfulness, and motivation to be the best lawyer he can
                        be.
                     
                     
                     Jeff's instructors noted that he treated all of his clients with the utmost respect
                        and regard for their personal dignity and needs as vulnerable elders. He excelled
                        in the seminar component of his clinical courses and made the most of the educational
                        opportunities that were offered. Additionally, the faculty noted that Jeff distinguished
                        himself throughout his clinical course by providing to his clients the kind of personal,
                        caring service that exemplifies the "kinder, gentler" type of practice that elder
                        lawyers are known for.
                     
                     
                     In their nomination letter for Mr. Slack, the Memphis Law clinical faculty noted several
                        things about Jeff that make him the ideal candidate for this award. They states that
                        as a student attorney enrolled in the Elder Law Clinic, Jeff treated all of his clients
                        with the utmost respect and regard for their personal dignity and needs as vulnerable
                        elders. He has been vigilant concerning ethical issues and understands that his role
                        as an attorney is to advance the cause of social justice. He excelled in the seminar
                        component of the course, producing exceptional reflection papers and taking all assignments
                        seriously, making the most of the educational opportunities that were being offered.
                        Jeff was always willing to go the extra mile, whether it be by coming in to the clinic
                        office over the weekend to review a 200 page packet of discovery obtained from the
                        opposing party in a case defending a client against collection of credit card debt,
                        or whether it be by driving out to meet with a client in the community to file documents
                        with the county Register of Deeds, rather than requiring the client to make the trip
                        downtown. Jeff distinguished himself throughout by providing to his clients the kind
                        of personal, caring service that exemplifies the "kinder, gentler" type of practice
                        that elder lawyers are known for.
