                        educational goals.
                     
                     
                     The State of Tennessee has reciprocity agreements with many other states which means
                        if you move you may have little to do to transfer your license. If you go to www.certificationmap.com you can find the licensure requirements of every state and additional information
                        about salary, reciprocity and other facts associated with being a teacher in the state
                        you choose to investigate.
                     
                     
                     Admission to the Teacher Education Program (TEP)
                     
                     All students seeking initial teacher licensure through the University of Memphis and
                        the College of Education must complete a two step  admission process to be accepted fully into the Teacher Education Program (TEP). Students applying to TEP must pass standardized tests and meet other admission requirements
                        (e.g. 3.0 grade point average for full admission at the undergraduate level) to prove
                        they have the potential to be high quality teachers that can pass our degree requirements
                        as well as pass the state's teacher license requirements. The College of Education
                        has very high expectations for both professionalism and performance.

                     Being a teacher is the most important job society has to offer: the education of its
                        young. A teacher experiences life in a way that no other professional can. If you
                        decide to become a teacher, you will touch the lives of hundreds of people, many of
                        whom you will cherish and always remember.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis  Ready2Teach Teacher Preparation Program,a nationally accredited program, is looking at the future
                        of PreK-12 education. We have raised admission/exit standards, redesigned our curriculum
                        to be practitioner oriented, built partnerships so our candidates complete their yearlong
                        Residency in the classrooms of the best teachers and our candidates must demonstrate
                        they can teach by submitting a successful edTPA, a nationally scored teacher performance
                        assessment that is modeled after the National Board of Professional Standards.
