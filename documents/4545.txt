                        faculty at the college, department and program levels. We are working to implement
                        a strategic resource investment budget model ( www.memphis.edu/sri ) that we expect will enable us to respond more effectively to a rapidly changing
                        higher education landscape.
                     
                     
                     The university has a bright future and is poised to make great strides for our students,
                        our employees, the local community, the state of Tennessee, and beyond. We are making
                        progress on achieving the operational goals of growing enrollment, increasing graduation
                        rates, expanding funded research, along with establishing and strengthening partnerships
                        with the community. As has already been shared, this past year witnessed impressive
                        numbers of graduates, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. We have held
                        tuition flat for the first time in more than two decades. Please join me in thanking
                        President Martin for his leadership, generosity and grace exhibited over the past
                        year.
                     
                     
                     Meeting our enrollment goal is a critical strategic focus. As you are likely aware,
                        one of the metrics that we use to predict enrollment for the upcoming academic year
                        is the number of admission applications. I am pleased to tell you that, as of today,
                        applications received were at the highest point in the history of the University of
                        Memphis. Well over 14,000 students have applied to the U of M, an increase of 82%
                        over the 2013-14 academic year. We anticipate that these numbers for the upcoming
                        year will continue to increase. Now the challenge is to translate these admission
                        applications into a greater number of students enrolled at both of our campuses, along
                        with those participating remotely. Orientation registrations are currently well ahead
                        of last year (up 400 as of this week). As you know, with improved graduation numbers
                        we'll be challenged to bring in greater numbers of first-time freshman and transfer
                        students, both of which look promising.
                     
                     
                     Although a bold goal, I genuinely believe we can increase the six-year graduation
                        rate to 55%, above the national average. In 2010, the U of M had a rate of 37.10%.
                        Changes to support programming and curriculum redesign efforts have increased this
                        rate to 44.2% as of fall 2013. This year we experienced significant gains that will
                        certainly move the six-year rate even higher. Achievement of this goal is critical
                        to our overall mission and essential for our students. Our efforts will continue to
                        expand as we develop a range of programs (peer mentoring, academic coaching, writing
                        center, degree pathways and a co-op program) targeting the diverse groups of students
                        we serve: first-time freshman, students with 90+ hours of coursework, veterans, online
                        learners, part-timers, returning adults, and other non-traditional students.
                     
                     
                     It is important for the University of Memphis to realize funded research of $100 million
                        in order to achieve the highest research classification awarded by the Carnegie Foundation
                        for the Advancement of Teaching – Research University/Very High Research Activity.
                        This designation is consistent with our goal of being recognized as one of America's
                        great metropolitan research universities. We have the faculty talent in place to make
                        this happen and we are making new investments in improving our research infrastructure
                        to better support their work. Not only is realizing this goal consistent with our
                        core mission, it will have significant impact on Memphis in general and result in
                        improved long-term state funding levels for the University.
                     
                     
                     Engagement is at the heart of a great metropolitan research university. We will continue
                        to expand our connections to Memphis, building on existing relationships and developing
                        new ones. As you know, our Key-30 effort (targeting the top 30 employers in Memphis)
                        will grow to Key 50 this year and to Key 75 next year. Our development efforts will
                        also expand, including efforts to grow our relationships with national foundations.
                        Chief among our efforts are to build a new research facility and a music building.
                     
                     
                     Your leadership team is committed, talented and passionate about the University of
                        Memphis, our mission, students and the community. Please join me in thanking and welcoming:
                        Interim Provost, Dr. Karen Weddle-West; Vice President of Student Affairs, Dr. Rosie
                        Phillips-Bingham; Vice President of Business and Finance, Mr. David Zettergren; Interim

                     University leadership will rely on input from faculty, staff, students and constituents
                        to identify issues, suggest improvements, and develop strategies to help us achieve
                        our goals. I will follow up with subsequent communications as planning unfolds. We
                        have a great opportunity to be bold, innovative and strategic in our thinking and
                        approach. I look forward to working with you and hearing from you in the coming years.
