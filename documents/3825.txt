			Dear Colleagues:
It gives me great pleasure to announce some very good news for the University–and to brag a bit on our tremendous faculty.
The Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) announced last Friday that the University of Memphis has been awarded six TBR Course Revitalization Grants.  Winning proposals were submitted by teams of UofM faculty in math, science, and foreign languages.  The purpose of the grant program is to support course redesign in courses with high enrollments and relatively low success rates.  Fifty-six awards were made in the statewide competition. 
By focusing on key courses, these course redesign initiatives will bolster the University’s ongoing efforts to emphasize learning outcomes, improve retention, and boost graduation rates.   Our outstanding faculty are to be congratulated for seizing this opportunity and taking leadership roles in improving educational outcomes for our students.
The winning teams are:
Biology 1110, General Biology I
Barbara Taller (Team Lead), Judy Cole, and Alka Sharma
  Biology 1120, General Biology II
Mel Beck (Team Lead), David Freeman, and Anna Bess Sorin
  Math 1530, Probability/Statistics/Non Calculus
Dale Bowman (Team Lead) and Manohar Aggarwal
  Math 1710, College Algebra
Annita Davis (Team Lead) and Misty Freeman
  Math 1910, Calculus I
James Campbell (Team Lead) and James Jamison
 Spanish 1010, Elementary Spanish I
Inmaculada Gomez Soler (Team Lead), Adoracion Berry, and Jennifer Johnston
 Thank you for your passionate commitment to our students and the University.  Your efforts to meet our challenges in a thoughtful and strategic way will reap great benefits.
 Go Tigers!
 M.  David Rudd, Provost

			Dear Colleagues:
As many of you are aware, we’ve made a concerted effort to increase enrollment, improve retention, and sharpen recruitment efforts over the past nine months.  I’m pleased to report signs of success, actually in record numbers. Our total undergraduate applications stand at 9,703 (9,325 on main campus and 378 on the Lambuth campus).  The actual application activity reports are linked below for your convenience.  Freshman applications are up 85%, with out-of-state freshman applications up a remarkable 229%.  I continue to be impressed that in-state freshman applications are increasing, up 51%. Transfer applications are up 24%, and total applications are up 75%.   Given the volume, we’re still processing applications.  Freshman admissions are up 23%, transfer admissions are up 22% and total admissions are up 23%. 
 Activity for the Lambuth campus continues to be the strongest we’ve seen since taking on the campus; clearly we’re getting some traction and making progress.  With respect to freshman applications, we’re up 179%, with out-of-state applications targeting Lambuth up an amazing eightfold.  The fact that we’re getting out of state activity specific to Lambuth is great to see and critical to progress on that campus.  Total applications (including transfers) are up 116%.  Freshman admissions are up 50%, with total admissions (including transfers) up 52%.  The early and strong trends continue. 
 Please join me in thanking all those involved, in particular vice-provost Betty Huff and director of admissions Steve McKellips, among a host of others.

						Appointment of Interim Vice-President of Research
			
						
				Posted on February 17, 2014  by  mmbuchnr@memphis.edu			
			
						
				Reply			
					

				
			Dear Colleagues:
           As part of the reconfiguration of the Office of the Provost, it was recommended that research services become a free-standing division in the University.  This change elevates the role of research, provides a voice at the highest administrative levels, and sets the stage for expanding research support and infrastructure on campus.  It is a pleasure to announce that Dr. Andy Meyers has agreed to serve as the interim vice-president for research.  Dr. Meyers has served the University of Memphis in varied administrative roles over the years, including chair of the Department of Psychology from 1990-2002, executive director of the FedEx Institute of Technology in 2004-2005, and most recently as vice-provost for research and executive director of the University of Memphis Research Foundation. 
            The University of Memphis has set a goal of $100 million in research expenditures, with annual award totals fluctuating for the past several years between $45 and $50 million. As shared previously, the University recently completed a research capacity analysis that will help guide the expansion of support and infrastructure geared to growing research activity, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary efforts.  An implementation plan has also been developed.  Both were the products of workgroups that included not only a broad cross section of faculty members but also members of the Faculty Senate Research Committee.
Sincerely,
M. David Rudd, Provost

						Adult Student College Re-Readiness Course Results
			
						
				Posted on February 14, 2014  by  mmbuchnr@memphis.edu

			Dear Colleagues:
 The University of Memphis serves a broad range of student constituencies, consistent with most urban public research universities. Accordingly, the strategies to grow enrollment (including enhanced retention) are a variety of programs and initiatives across many targeted groups. I am very proud to share some exciting results Dr. Richard L. Irwin, Associate Dean, University College, has reported from a pilot study this fall involving college re-readiness course for returning adult students. 
 Tracy Robinson, Director of Online Education, in collaboration with Colton Cockrum, Assistant Director of Academic Retention and Enrichment Services, created an “open access” college readiness course for a select group of adult students.  Of the 36 students invited to participate 13 accepted with 11 fully completing the course.  Astonishingly, those that completed the course achieved a fall semester GPA of 3.71 (incoming average overall GPA was 2.46), a full point higher than the students who declined our invitation (semester GPA of 2.67).  Obviously, their performance was influenced by multiple variables but we are thrilled to see that this course may represent one of the keys to their success. We anticipate similar progress this semester.
 
Tiger Blue Transition/Adult College Re-Readiness Course
Fall 2013 pilot

Open to new or readmitted adult students in University College
 Free to student (not a Banner course)
Students identified by academic advisor and invited to participate
Could be converted to tuition and credit bearing course through UNIV independent study 

Goals for course:
1.       Focus on preparing them to be successful in fall 2013 classes
2.       Reduce anxiety about return to school
3.       Increase retention of these students
4.       Orient them to University, eCourseware, and resources available to them
Learning Modules:

eCourseware orientation/navigation
 Library
Writing skills
Support services/resources
Time Management
Study skills
Note-taking strategies
 Degree options/planning/advising/registration

Of the Students who accepted the invitation to enroll in the module:         

Average age of the students = 44 (ages range from 26 to 73)
Almost 50/50 ratio of male to female
70% are readmitted students with an average time away from the University of 15 years
85% are within 50 miles of campus
Average incoming GPA = 2.46
Average earned credit hours = 70 (range from 6 to 128)
Average enrollment for fall term = 6 credit hours (online, campus, and extended sites)

Obviously this is an endeavor that merits our applause.  Thanks to Dean Irwin, Mrs. Robinson, and Dr. Cockrum, whose leadership charted one path to student success for this group of returning adult students.
 Go Tigers!

						Update on Retention Programs
			
						
				Posted on February 12, 2014  by  mmbuchnr@memphis.edu			
			
						
				Reply			
					

				
			Dear Colleagues:
As detailed in the Integrated Enrollment Plan (link below), we have a number of retention and completion efforts underway.  In an effort to make sure we expend targeted retention funds in the most effective way possible, I have required that all programs demonstrate efficacy through small pilots prior to any broader implementation.  This has provided some great data and laid an empirically-informed foundation for planning purposes.  The programs mentioned below build on the remarkable success of several externally funded programs, including the TRIO programs (federal funds) and First Scholars (supported by the Suder Foundation).  You can find out more about these programs on the University webpage.   Their retention and completion rates have been nothing short of exceptional.   The TRIO Classic program serves 200 students across all majors and has a one-year retention rate of 81% and six-year graduation rate of 57%. The TRIO STEM program serves 120 STEM majors and has a one-year retention rate of 79%.  (The program has only been in existence since 2010; we do not yet have a six-year graduation rate for TRIO STEM). 
Two new efforts, in particular, are worth mention. First, the Academic Coaching for Excellence (ACE) program provides proactive support for students identified as potentially at-risk in accordance with a range of variables critical to degree completion. A small pilot funded this past year demonstrated noticeable improvement in retention for the students involved.  Similarly, the students voiced strong support for the role played by their coaches.  This effort will be expanded in the 2014-2015 academic year.  I’ll keep you updated on progress and outcomes.
The U of M Finish Line Program targets students no longer enrolled with 90+ hours that have not re-enrolled at another institution of higher education. In short, these students have had to abandon their dreams of completing a college degree.  The 90+ threshold is significant for several reasons. First, these students have demonstrated the ability to be successful in college. Second, they are within a single academic year of successful graduation (i.e. 30 hours). And finally, the primary reason for withdrawal at 90+ hours is not poor academic performance, rather financial and related psychosocial challenges. 
The Finish Line program was launched this past fall under the direction of Dr. Dick Irwin (University College).  Over 2,800 students have already been identified who withdrew from the University over the past four years meeting the 90+ criteria.  The Finish Line team has implemented a protocol for identifying qualified students at the end of each semester, providing the opportunity for quick and effective intervention.  Initial results from a pilot of 70 students revealed the ability to re-establish contact with the majority through email, phone or traditional mail service, with over 90% of those contacted enthusiastic about the opportunity to complete their degree. This year alone, almost 50% of those engaged in the pilot study will complete their degrees in 2014, requiring only very limited financial support and assistance with effective degree planning. 
Early returns suggest this program could well be one of the single most effective retention and completion tools available at the University of Memphis.  In addition to efficiently growing support staff for this program, we are pursuing private support for scholarship funds. I’ve pasted the Finish Line logo below; Linda Bonnin’s group did a great job with the design.
As you can see we’re making strategic investments to improve retention and completion at the University of Memphis.  Your support and hard work is greatly appreciated.

						Progress on Degree Completion
			
						
				Posted on February 11, 2014  by  David			
			
						
				Reply			
					

				
			As promised, here’s a progress update on degree completion efforts at the University of Memphis.  Not only is degree completion central to our obligation to our students, we have now transitioned to an outcomes based formula funding model, with a focus on student progression and graduation.  As mentioned on 2/7/2014 our doctoral degree completion numbers have improved in profound fashion, and we’ll see significant increases this spring. We’re also seeing similar improvement at the undergraduate level.  Growth from the 2012 academic year to the 2013 academic year was 5%, with expected growth for the current 2014 academic year estimated at another 2%.  As the graph below indicates, we’re projecting growth in the 6% range through 2016.  My guess is that we’ll actually outpace those projections given performance over the past two years.

Congratulations on a great effort.  Having talked with quite a few students, I know they are grateful.  The impact of completing a college degree has positive influence across multiple domains, including not just the students, but families and communities as well.
Go Tigers!

						Budget Plans Finalized
			
						
				Posted on February 10, 2014  by  mmbuchnr@memphis.edu			
			
						
				Reply			
					

				
			Dear Colleagues:
            This past Friday I met with the Budget Working Group to finalize our strategic budget for the coming fiscal year. From the beginning our focus has been on strengthening our ability to deliver our teaching and research missions and growing revenue, while doing so in the most efficient and effective manner possible. The budget submission process has been completed, the faculty and research mission have been preserved and we have created a solid foundation for the fall of 2014 and beyond.    We have a broad range of recruitment, retention, and completion efforts already underway.  I’ll be sharing details and early results over the next two weeks.  I think you will be pleased with indications of early progress and momentum. I want to thank the deans and chairs for their leadership and hard work. 
            I am pleased to share that the budget reductions in Academic Affairs are now complete, with total reductions of $10,570,007 in the coming fiscal year and $4.5 million rolled into the next fiscal year.  This approach will allow time for careful study and also an opportunity to gauge any growth secondary to the broad range of retention and completion initiatives already underway.  Of the total, $3,554,733 (34%) is being captured through administrative reductions and $3.2 million (30%) through the recovery of designated tuition/fee funds (as shared very early in the discussions).  In short, 64% of the total reductions are outside of the core academic delivery and research mission of the University. 
          As noted before the holiday break, there will be no faculty layoffs, with the reductions being managed through normal attrition.  It is important to mention that we have taken care to position ourselves for growth in targeted colleges and programs, along with supporting our core research mission. We have strengthened our ability to deliver a comprehensive educational experience for our students, reaching from the arts to the sciences.  For the first time in over a decade we will expand our research support infrastructure, with services provided at the college level. Our commitment to interdisciplinary research will continue to expand in concrete and practical ways over the next few years.
            I have asked Dick Evans, President of the Faculty Senate, to work with the Senate membership and offer recommendations on a mechanism for annual reviews of academic program performance, along with administrative efficiency and effectiveness.  This group will provide input for the Budget Working Group and the central administration on how well our budget decisions continue to align with university priorities. 
            Thank you for your hard work and for caring so deeply about the University of Memphis and our students.  We’re making great progress and meeting the challenges in a thoughtful and strategic fashion. 
 Go Tigers!
M. David Rudd, Provost

						Doctoral Degrees Increasing
			
						
				Posted on February 7, 2014  by  mmbuchnr@memphis.edu			
			
						
				Reply			
					

				
			Dear Colleagues:
Here’s another update on our efforts to grow enrollment and help our students successfully complete their degrees. Efforts to increase our doctoral production are working and this is very good news, indeed, with profound positive consequences for both our academic mission and our financial health.
One-hundred thirty (130) doctoral students have applied for May 2014 graduation.  Seventy-one (71) doctoral students have graduated so far this academic year: Forty-six (46) doctoral students in Summer 2013 and twenty-five (25) doctoral students in Fall 2013.  Perhaps not all 130 who have applied will graduate this semester, but if even just over half of the candidates pass their dissertation defenses, we will surpass the number of doctoral graduates for 2013-2014 and set a new University of Memphis record.
Doctoral Degrees Granted



AY 2010-2011

129



AY 2011-2012

136



AY 2012-2013

135



AY 2013-2014 potential

201




 
If everyone who has applied for doctoral degrees for May 2014 is successful, we could graduate 201 doctoral students this academic year–an astounding 54% increase!   Under the current funding formula the University stands to reap significant financial rewards by increasing the number of doctoral degrees awarded.
As I like to say, I am profoundly confident in our ability to be innovative and creative and to meet the needs of our students in an efficient and effective fashion. Core to our mission is an obligation to help our students not only complete their degrees and launch their futures, but also overcome potential barriers to success. Our success is tied to theirs. You are to be congratulated on your remarkable efforts to make this work.
Go Tigers!
M. David Rudd, Provost

			Dear Colleagues:
 Consistent with a firm commitment to growing interdisciplinary research and teaching on campus, efforts to establish an integrated College of Health Sciences are taking another step forward with the appointment of a transition planning group.  The College of Health Sciences will include the School of Public Health, the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, and a proposal for a newly formed School comprised of the existing Department of Health and Sports Sciences. The new College of Health Sciences is actually the realization of an idea that has been considered for several years now, initially discussed in 2008.  The new college will allow for greater interdisciplinary collaboration in the health sciences, along with improved administrative efficiency, including not only administrative staffing but also space utilization.   A decision was made to leave the Loewenberg School of Nursing autonomous given its unique opportunities for growth and expansion in the local clinical health services delivery community.  The executive dean for the new College of Health Sciences will be Dr. Don Wagner.   Dean Wagner was engaged in similar restructuring  efforts at the University of Cincinnati.
 Transition team members for the College of Health will include:
 Dr. Donald Wagner – Workgroup Chair
Dr. Linda Jarmulowicz, Associate Dean, Communication Sciences and Disorders
Dr. Robin Roach, Professor of Nutrition and Dietetics
Dr. Marian Levy, Assistant Dean, School of Public Health
Dr. Richard Bloomer, Professor of Exercise Science and Chair, Department of Health and Sport Sciences
 The College of Education will consist of the departments and programs currently in the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences, with the exception of HSS.   The transition team for the College of Education will include:
 Dr. Sutton Flynt-Chair
Dr. Ernie Rakow
Dr. Deborah Lowther
Dr. Larry McNeal
Dr. Doug Strohmer
 The transition planning teams will identify and address issues critical to the transitions. 
Sincerely,
 M. David Rudd, Provost

						Why Do Students Leave the University of Memphis?
			
						
				Posted on February 4, 2014  by  mmbuchnr@memphis.edu			
			
						
				Reply			
					

				
			Dear Colleagues:
In earlier postings I have stressed our efforts to grow enrollment, improve retention and help our students successfully complete their degrees as critical to our mission. An important part of this conversation must include an honest effort to answer the question “Why do students leave the University of Memphis?”  We’ve been looking carefully at academic performance, along with a broad range of challenges and stressors students face.
A survey was recently administered to students who were enrolled at the University of Memphis during the Spring 2012 term but did not re-enroll for the Fall 2013 term.  This pilot study attempted to glean information about the students who leave the university.  Two hundred and fifteen students who either had cumulative GPAs above 2.0 or who were in good academic standing at the end of the term completed the survey. It’s critical to recognize that almost 87% of our students carry cumulative  GPA’s at 2.0 or above, indicating the ability to successfully complete college.  We’re currently graduating about half of these students.  
Fifty-two items in the survey determined whether the students possess certain characteristics or beliefs and whether or not these qualities influenced the students’ decision to leave.  Consistent with anecdotal evidence over the years, it was discovered that some of the most influential factors in a student’s decision to depart are related to monetary or work issues.  Here are some of the most frequent responses:

I needed more money to be able to support myself (49%)
The amount of student loan debt worries me (56%)
I ran out of financial aid funds (46%)
I didn’t want to take on more debt in order to go to school (41%)
In the most recent term that I attended the UofM, I worked more than 20 hours per week (60%)
I was satisfied with the quality of instruction at the UofM (52%)
I paid for most of my college expenses (36%) 
I had conflicts with my job schedule (30%)
Working and going to school was too stressful (28%) 

Surprisingly, many previously accepted reasons for students’ departures appear to have very little actual influence on our students’ decisions.  The majority of students who leave the UofM were not dissatisfied with the instruction.  Remarkably, only 9 percent of these “leaving” would not recommend the UofM to someone else.  Furthermore, the vast majority of departing students did not experience discrimination; only 2.6% of participants expressed that they experienced racial/ethnic discrimination or sexual discrimination at the UofM.
Retaining students already attending the University of Memphis represents our single greatest challenge. It is critical to recognize that the majority of students leave the University in good academic standing, and many do not attend another institution of higher education.  As has been reported previously, the numbers leaving after successfully completing 90+ hours are alarming.  Pilot studies indicate such losses are primarily the result of financial challenges and psychosocial issues.  In short, the University of Memphis is grappling with an enrollment problem that is more expansive than the recruitment of first-time freshma n– it’s one characterized by profound retention challenges among sophomores, juniors and seniors .  The good news is that these are problems we can target in specific fashion and likely influence on a short time horizon. 
Why do students leave us? The simple answer is that they cannot afford to stay in school. It is not difficult to sort out why:

U of M tuition has nearly doubled in the last ten years
Students exhaust their loan capacity before they can graduate, often times taking courses that don’t count toward their eventual major
And student debt is at an all time high.

The college graduating class of 2012 is, on average, deeper in the hole with student loan debt than any class before. An independent, nonprofit organization based in Oakland, Calif., the Institute for College Access & Success, recently released its eighth annual report on average student loan debt in the U.S., which found that college graduates who borrowed for bachelor’s degrees granted in 2012 had an average student loan debt of $29,400 — the highest average student loan debt on record. ICAS reported that 57% of the 2012 graduates at The University of Memphis left with educational debt.
“The graduates of 2012 left school and entered repayment at a time of high unemployment,” said Debbie Cochrane, research director at the institute. “In many ways, these graduates were hit from both sides.” They went to college during a recession when their family’s ability to pay for college was likely reduced. Now they are graduating from college and may be experiencing substantial challenges getting a job to repay the loans.”
The University’s decision not to raise tuition next year is one important step towards addressing our students’ financial burden. The driving force behind our efforts to restructure and reexamine the organization of the University can be summed up in one word, students.   We are determined not to shift the rising cost of education to our students, and to find every way possible to tie our success to their success.
With your help it is a goal we can reach.  You will be hearing more about our proposed Degree Pathway Initiative in the coming weeks.
Go Tigers!
 M. David Rudd, Provost
