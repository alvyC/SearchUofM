                     Parking at the University of Memphis Lambuth & Millington Campuses
                     
                     All employees of the University of Memphis Lambuth and Millington Campuses must have
                        a University-issued parking permit displayed in their vehicle at all times. Any vehicle
                        without the proper permit/semester validation sticker is subject to receiving a citation
                        and/or towing.  Regular full-time employees are eligible for payroll deduction. To begin payroll
                        deduction of $24.94 per month for your parking permit, please email your request for
                        payroll deduction, along with name, UUID and mailing address to tigerpark@memphis.edu .  Those who do not wish to sign up for payroll deduction can pay online by clicking
                        here .  Permits and stickers will be mailed to the address you designate when you purchase
                        your permit or sign up for payroll deduction.
                     
                     
                     If you are a student at the University of Memphis Lambuth or Millington campuses,
                        please request your General Parking permit by submitting an e-mail request to parking@memphis.edu . Please be sure to include the following information: full name, mailing address,
                        and Banner ID. If you are a student and need a REPLACEMENT permit, you may order online
                        here . In addition, your permit must be reported as lost, stolen, or missing to the Parking
                        & Transportation Services office.
