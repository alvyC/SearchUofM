                        The University of Memphis Commencement Office has a rental agreement with the cap
                           and gown vendor. So, we appreciate your assistance in keeping our costs down. Your
                           fees only pay for a rental. All parts, including the cap, must be returned after usage
                           and cannot be kept or decorated. 
                        
                        
                        If you decorate your cap, you will be charged and your diploma held. 
                        
                     
                     
                     Instructions for Wearing Regalia Hood (Doctoral, Specialist, Master and Law)
                     
                     
                        
                        To insure proper fit of your hood, we suggest that men wear a dress shirt and women
                           wear a blouse with buttons or a suit.
                        
                        
                        Hold the hood in your hand by the velvet at the narrowest point. The loop should be
                           hanging straight down. Grasp the loop in your right hand and place the hood over your
                           head so the loop continues to hang straight down in front of your neck.
                        
                        
                        Fasten the loop over a button on your shirt/blouse or jacket, or you may pin it in
                           place. This will prevent the hood from pressing on your throat.
                        
                        
                        Midway down the back of the hood you will find another satin cord and loop. Fasten
                           this loop around the button on the inside of the hood to prevent the hood from falling
                           off your shoulders. This may require the assistance of another person.
                        
                        
                        Be sure to have someone "fluff" the back of the hood just below the button, by turning
                           the velvet side underneath to expose the satin colors on the inside.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     when/where do I return my cap and gown? 
                     
                     
                        
                        Caps, gowns and hoods are rentals and MUST be returned in the same way received. 
                        
                        
                        All items should be returned after Commencement to the vendor truck (located downstairs
                           behind the stage)
