                     May 8, 2015 - Public health, public policy and issues of health disparities are at
                        the forefront of many of America's unresolved social problems. Rising health care
                        costs pose a growing threat to the economy, while for some access to even the most
                        basic health care is tenuous. Lawyers play a central role in society's approach to
                        these public health issues. However, their effectiveness is frequently limited by
                        an inadequate knowledge of public health matters. To close that educational gap, the
                        University of Memphis has created the JD/MPH program.
                     
                     
                     The program offers students the opportunity to pursue JD (juris doctor) and MPH (master
                        of public health) degrees simultaneously. Students will have the ability to complete
                        both degrees in four years of full-time study, a year less than it would take to complete
                        each degree separately.
                     
                     
                     The goal of the JD/MPH program is to prepare and train students to apply law and policy
                        to benefit public health. The dual degree allows law students to combine in-depth
                        advocacy and policy skills learned in the UofM's JD program with the population health
                        perspective gained in the MPH program to address policy and advocacy needs at the
                        community level.
                     
                     
                     "This interdisciplinary professional education supports the training of highly competent
                        public health lawyers, as well as public health professionals skilled in advocacy
                        and public health policy," said Dr. Marian Levy, assistant dean of Students and Public
                        Health Practice in the School of Public Health. "This dual degree program addresses
                        community needs related to environmental and social justice, access to health care
                        and other pressing public health concerns."
                     
                     
                     Amy Campbell, associate law professor and director of the Institute for Health & Law
                        Policy, said, "We're delighted by this formal partnership and the commitment to interdisciplinary
                        education that it represents. The JD/MPH dual degree option opens up for law students
                        interested in public health law – a growth area within health law – an invaluable
                        opportunity for deepened engagement with public health professional colleagues, with
                        the hope that this enhances their appreciation for and skills in developing evidence-informed
                        health policy. It also reaffirms the institute's mission of 'using law to advance
                        health' for the benefit of our Memphis community."
