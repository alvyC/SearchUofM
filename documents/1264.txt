                     Transfer Credit Evaluation Process
At the University of Memphis there are two situations where it would be necessary to have a transfer credit evaluation completed.
1. New transfer students to the University of Memphis or readmitting students who, since last attending the UofM, have attempted course work from another accredited institution of higher education, will be required to have their transcript/s sent to the Office of Admissions for evaluation. An admissions analyst will review the transcript and evaluate each course for equivalency to a course at the UofM . Some courses will have a direct equivalent and therefore, will receive credit for that class. Other courses may be evaluated and not have a direct equivalent - in those cases, credits will be assigned as electives. Exactly how each course fulfills degree program requirements will be determined by the student's academic advisor. There may also be times where courses will not transfer at all.  Transfer credit evaluations will only be completed after a student has been fully admitted to the University of Memphis in a degree seeking status.
2. Transfer credit evaluations are completed when a currently enrolled University of Memphis student opts to take a course at another institution for credit. In this situation, the student is required to meet with his/her advisor to determine the course equivalency prior to registering for the course at the other institution. Additional information on the transfer credit request process is available online.
