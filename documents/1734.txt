                     PHOTOS A family friendly, classic story re-told in an exciting and creative fun filled way! Since its publication seventy years ago, Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's The Little Prince
                        has captivated millions of readers throughout the world. When a world-weary aviator
                        whose malfunctioning plane strands him on the Sahara Desert, a mysterious, regal little
                        boy appears to guide him through a transforming experience and teaches him "what is
                        essential is invisible to the eye." The Little Prince speaks to the castaway in all
                        of us: challenging our perspective, opening our eyes and bringing us back to the heart
                        of what truly matters.
