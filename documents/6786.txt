                     Research on radio frequency identification (RFID) applications has grown significantly
                        as the technology can potentially improve organizational performance and enable new
                        business models. However, actual implementation has been slow to transition from back
                        office operations to front office applications, as many customers have demonstrated
                        concern about the invasion of personal privacy and/or the improper utilization of
                        information. This research aims to explore the customer acceptance issue by examining
                        the factors that potentially enable and inhibit the utilization of RFID-enabled systems.
                        To accomplish this goal, we conducted three studies using information from over 800
                        consumers, while employing three different methodologies. Results indicate potential
                        usage of RFID systems can be positively impacted by the perceived usefulness (PU)
                        of the technology, while privacy concerns have a negative impact. In particular, the
                        positive impact of PU appears to weigh more heavily on consumers than the negative
                        impact of privacy concerns. Additionally, there are differences in privacy concerns,
                        technology attitudes, and purchase intentions based on how the system is labeled,
                        along with the nature of the privacy statement. Accordingly, firms need to be specific
                        in their privacy statements as this practice yields higher customer purchase intentions.
                        From a managerial perspective, it is imperative that companies present a clear message
                        to customers as to how RFID can benefit them while also being clear and concise about
                        how any information associated with the technology will be used in an ethical manner.
