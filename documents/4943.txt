                        About Dr. Debes
                        
                        After earning a B.A. at Boston University, Prof. Debes completed his PhD in Philosophy
                           at the University of Michigan, where he won awards for both his teaching and his dissertation
                           work, including a Charlotte Newcombe Fellowship in 2005-06. He joined the faculty
                           at Memphis in 2006. His published research is in the areas of Moral Theory and the
                           History of Ethics, with an emphasis on Human Dignity, Metaethics, Moral Psychology,
                           Empathy, the Philosophy of Emotion and Enlightenment Ethics (esp. David Hume and Adam
                           Smith).
                        
                        
                        Currently Prof. Debes is working on three projects. He is editing Dignity: History
                           of a Concept (under contract with Oxford University Press); he is co-editing Ethical
                           Sentimentalism (with Karsten Stueber, under contract with Cambridge University Press);
                           and he is working to connect his work on human dignity to new research on understanding
                           and respect. In Spring 2014 Prof. Debes won a 72K grant from the Templeton Foundation
                           to fund a 2014-2015 sabbatical project entitled "Understanding as a form of Respect."

                        Prof. Debes has taught Introduction to Philosophy, Ethical Theory, Contemporary Moral
                           Problems, the Philosophy of Law, and graduate seminars on Human Dignity, Empathy,
                           and Scottish Sentimentalism. In 2009 he was named an Alumni Distinguished Teacher,
                           one of four faculty members university-wide to receive this recognition. He was recognized
                           again in 2010 with one of two College of Arts and Sciences Excellence in Teaching
                           Awards. He served as Director of Undergraduate Advising from 2008-2011 and in 2011
                           was the sole recipient of the Dean's Award for Excellence in Advising. He served as
                           the Secretary and Treasurer to the International Adam Smith Society for over 6 years,
                           and is currently on the Editorial Board for the Journal of Scottish Philosophy. He
                           has also organized a number of national and international conferences: Go here to
                           learn about some of the events Prof. Debes has directed. When he is not doing philosophy
                           he is playing pretend games with his daughters, thinking about super heroes, searching
                           for cool new music, or admiring his very mischievous cats.
