                     The University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law and the City of Memphis
                        have hired Brittany Williams as the first "City of Memphis Neighborhood Preservation
                        Fellow."
                     
                     
                     As a Fellow, Williams will assist in case handling and management for Neighborhood
                        Preservation Act cases and other Environmental Court cases filed by the City. She
                        will also draft and file lawsuits in Environmental Court, as well as communicate outside
                        of court with defendants and attorneys for defendants regarding the status of all
                        cases filed with Environmental Court or otherwise managed by the Neighborhood Preservation
                        Clinic on behalf of the City. She will represent the City in litigation against owners
                        of blighted property that violates City codes and will provide assistance to students
                        enrolled in the University of Memphis Neighborhood Preservation Clinic in regards
                        to case filing and management.
                     
                     
                     The City of Memphis provided the law school with $150,000 of funding to support this
                        unique position through December 31, 2017, with proceeds from its Vacant Property
                        Registry used to fund the unique partnership. As part of the agreement, the "Neighborhood
                        Preservation Fellow" must be a Memphis Law graduate, with preference given to a graduate
                        who has successfully completed a semester in the law school's Neighborhood Preservation
                        Clinic, or participated in the anti-blight litigation externship with the City of
                        Memphis Law Division.
                     
                     
                     Brittany Williams, a Class of 2015 Memphis Law graduate, was officially named the
                        first Neighborhood Preservation Fellow in Summer 2016, only one year after successfully
                        graduating from law school. Prior to her appointment as Fellow, Brittany worked for
                        the law firm of Brewer & Barlow, PLC as a law clerk and in March 2016 was named the
                        Interim Neighborhood Preservation Fellow before her official appointment in June of
                        2016.
                     
                     
                     "Our efforts with the City of Memphis to fight blight allow us to not only help the
                        city itself, but also give our current students, and now our graduates like Brittany
                        Williams, the ability to play a front-line role in this critical fight," said Dean
                        Peter V. Letsou. "We are training our students to tackle a problem that lacked a focused
                        solution before this partnership and, in doing so, we are helping to provide Memphis
                        with specially trained attorneys to alleviate this blight epidemic."
                     
                     
                     The fellowship adds yet another component to the law school's and the City's dedicated
                        fight against blight in the Mid-South. The law school and the City of Memphis last
                        year announced the creation and launch of the Neighborhood Preservation Clinic, a
                        partnership between the law school and the City's legal division that allows law students
                        to earn real-world experience for law students in issues of blight, property abandonment,
                        and neglect through the handling of cases in the Shelby County Environmental Court.
                        The clinic is co-directed by local attorney and Memphis Law adjunct faculty member
                        Steve Barlow and Assistant Professor of Law and Director of Experiential Learning
                        Daniel Schaffzin. Over the past year, law students in the clinic have studied the
                        laws concerning real property abandonment and neglect in Memphis, and worked with
                        code enforcement officers to prosecute civil lawsuits filed pursuant to the Tennessee
                        Neighborhood Preservation Act. The clinic and the City celebrated the filing of the
                        City's 1,000th lawsuit against blighted property owners during the fall 2015 semester.
