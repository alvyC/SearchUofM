                     Over the years, both undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Memphis
                        have requested a dual program for the Law J.D. and the Political Science M.A. degree

                        career-related disciplines can be earned simultaneously if admissions and curricula
                        are carefully structured. Many reputable institutions elsewhere, such as Yale, Duke,
                        Syracuse, Tulane, and Cincinnati, have such programs. None of them, however, is close
                        to Memphis, so adding the program provides a competitive advantage in the Mid-South.
                     
                     
                     Below are the requirements for the TBR-approved program. Basically, students may begin
                        the M.A. in Political Science and then, pending separate admission, attend Law School
                        where they may apply 16 credit hours (see below) to finish the M.A. Alternatively,
                        they may first begin Law School and, pending separate admission, follow with the M.A.
                        degree and similarly apply 16 hours of Law School credit to the M.A.

                     Admission to the dual program will require separate admission to each program. However,

                        LSAT scores in lieu of the GRE. Students are admitted into each program separately;
                        completion of one degree is not contingent upon completion of both.
