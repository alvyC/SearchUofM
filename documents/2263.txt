                        community development organizations) in exchange for full tuition remission and a

                     Tuition Savings Program for Students
                     
                     The Academic Common Market is a tuition-savings program for students in the 16 Southern
                        Regional Education Board member states who want to pursue degrees in fields that are
                        not offered by their in-state institutions. These students enroll in out-of-state
                        universities that offer the specialized degree programs, and they pay only the in-state
                        tuition rates. Visit the Academic Common Market for more information. Federal Financial Aid
