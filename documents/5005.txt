                     Wouldn't our jobs be easier if computers could do more of our tedious, but exacting
                        tasks for us? In an important way, the United States Navy believes so.
                     
                     
                     With an Intelligent Distribution Agent (IDA), the Navy has an intelligent software
                        representative that automates the decision-making process for assigning sailors to
                        their new posts. By communicating with sailors by email, much as a human would, IDA
                        can negotiate new jobs and eventually make assignments based on Navy policies and
                        the sailors' preferences. Basically, IDA technology:
                     
                     
                     accesses the Navy's many large databases (personnel job requisition, training classes,
                        etc.) applies tremendous processing power to sort through all of the facts to consider in
                        the databases, and applies other human-like brain mechanisms to make the best decision for the individual
                        sailor and the Navy. IDA shows promise for fully automating the jobs of information providers and decision-makers
                        such as customer service agents, travel agents, and loan officers.
                     
                     
                     A significant extension of IDA, the LIDA (Learning IDA) project adds several types
                        of learning. LIDA is a broad, comprehensive cognitive architecture that attempts to
                        model how minds work. As such LIDA will provide hypotheses and direction for future
                        research.

                     LIDA Model: Computational Framework
                     
                     PI: Stan Franklin Intelligent software agents aiming toward general intelligence are complex systems
                        and, as such, are difficult and time consuming to implement and to customize. A software
                        framework is a reusable implementation of the skeleton of a software system, capturing
                        its generic functionality. By significantly reducing the amount of effort necessary
                        to develop customized applications, frameworks are becoming increasingly attractive
                        for the implementation of intelligent software agents.
                     
                     
                     The LIDA Framework is a generic and customizable computational implementation of the
                        LIDA model, programmed in Java. It allows for the relatively rapid development of
                        LIDA controlled software agents for specific problem domains, using a declarative
                        specification of the agent architecture by an XML file. Small pieces of the system,
                        and even the internal implementation of whole modules, can be customized. Since biological
                        minds operate in parallel, the Framework provides for multithreading support. Its
                        implementation adheres to several well-established design principles, and best programming
                        practices. The LIDA Framework is available online for research use, and has been used
                        to produce, so far, four LIDA based software agents, resulting in two publications.

                     LIDA Model: Experiment Replication
                     
                     PI: Stan Franklin Touted as a cognitive model, LIDA must constitute a valid scientific model of how
                        minds work. A major way to test this is through the replication of data from existing
                        psychological experiments. This project involves building software agents based on
                        the LIDA model to perform experiments, and comparing the results to those from human
                        or animal subjects. Compatible results constitute evidence for the LIDA model. Incompatible
                        results necessitate some updating of the model or its parameters. We've learned something.
                        Science is working. In addition to testing the LIDA model, such work thus contributes
                        to the identification of the internal parameters for the model including determining
                        appropriate values. Until now, we've replicated two such experiments bearing on the
                        timing of the action-perception cycle, one modeling the attentional blink phenomenon,
                        and another exploring executive attention. The first three are published.

                     LIDA Model: Medical Agent X (MAX)
                     
                     PI: Stan Franklin A real world application of the LIDA model, Medical Agent X (MAX) will be a LIDA-based
                        software agent situated in hybrid real and digital environment composed of healthcare
                        providers, clinical data regarding the providers' patients, and the diagnostic possibilities
                        associated with that data. MAX will use human-style reasoning, and will communicate
                        with the providers in natural language. It will generate diagnostic hypotheses by

                     LIDA Model: From Perception to Cognition
                     
                     PI: Stan Franklin Intelligent agents operating in complex "real-world" environments must generate their
                        own understanding of their current situation from their sensory primitives. In some
                        cases, for example in the visual modality in humans, the process of meaning creation
                        and understanding is exceedingly complex. Cognitive architectures have historically
                        eschewed considerations of the details of perception, and of reconciling high-level
                        representations, useful for reasoning, logic, and planning, with high-dimensional,
                        transient, noisy sensory stimuli. In this project we take a biologically-inspired
                        view, within a broad cognitive model, LIDA, of how the abstract, invariant, and conceptual
                        aspects of detailed, low-level sensory representation are recognized and associated.
                        Such work fleshes out the details of LIDA's Sensory Memory, Perceptual Associative
                        Memory, and conscious learning. Also covered is the critical relation of attentional
                        and learning processes with this perceptual process.

                     Vector LIDA using Extended Integer SDM
                     
                     PI: Stan Franklin Sparse distributed memory (SDM) is a mathematical model of human long-term memory
                        based on large binary vectors. It is distributed, auto-associative, content addressable,
                        and noise robust. Moreover, it exhibits one-shot learning, is resilient to damage,
                        and its contents degrade gracefully when the memory fills up. Its interesting psychological
                        characteristics include interference, knowing when it does not know, and the tip of
                        the tongue effect. SDM's structure is ideal for parallel processing or hardware implementation.
                        All this makes it an attractive option for modeling memory modules in cognitive architectures
                        and other AI applications.
                     
                     
                     Extended SDM uses a novel mechanism to add hetero-associativity to SDM, making it
                        particularly effective for sequence learning. Integer SDM extends the memory to accept
                        integer vectors, while retaining the benefits of the model. Built upon Extended Integer
                        SDM, Modular Composite Representation (MCR,) allows the representation of complex
                        structures using single vectors, making them attractive for modeling internal data
                        representations in cognitive architectures.
                     
                     
                     These technologies constitute the heart of the new Vector LIDA project that is implementing
                        the LIDA architecture using MCR vectors for data representation. Vector LIDA should
                        produce a more realistic and biologically plausible model, better integration with
                        low-level perceptual processing, better scalability, and easier learning mechanisms.
