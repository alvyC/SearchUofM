                     Non-Resident Honors Student Award (Out of State Students Only) Thirty Non-Resident Honors Student Awards are available on a competitive basis to
                        non-resident freshmen students who enroll full-time, who meet the full requirements
                        for admission to the Hardin Honors Program (at least a 27 on the ACT/1200 SAT and
                        a high school GPA of at least a 3.50), and who are actively pursuing graduation with
                        an honors designation. This award pays out-of-state tuition fees only and is renewable
                        for up to eight full-time semesters.  Continuation of the award from semester to semester
                        is only guaranteed if the student meets all the criteria for membership in the Honors
                        Program.  For more information, please contact the Honors Program.
                     
                     
                     National Scholarships/Fellowships The Honors Program identifies and assists well-qualified students in competing for
                        prestigious national and international fellowships (Goldwater, Truman, Rhodes, Marshall,
                        and others).  As a general rule, successful applicants for these scholarships have
                        a 3.7 GPA or higher.  Depending on the scholarship, an exemplary academic record must
                        be matched by leadership positions in extracurricular organizations or community service
                        (e.g., Truman Scholarship) or ample research experience (e.g., Goldwater Scholarship).
                     
                     
                     All prospective applicants are encouraged to visit the scholarship web sites and carefully
                        read their guidelines and eligibility requirements.  Students interested in fellowship
                        opportunities should contact the Honors Office.
