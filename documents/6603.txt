                           Research Interests
                           
                           Research interests in the Parrill group are in the areas broadly described as computational
                              structural biology and rational ligand design. The rapid growth of experimental techniques
                              that probe the three-dimensional structure of biologically important structures such
                              as proteins have provided a wealth of information that can be used to study protein
                              structure and design ligands that will bind to these molecules. Such ligands can be
                              used to gather additional information that is useful for the optimization of drugs
                              and molecules with other important functions. Specific projects related to both computational
                              structural biology and rational ligand design involve studies of the interactions
                              between existing or newly designed ligands with interesting biological targets.
