                     Center for Research in Educational Policy
                     
                     The Center for Research in Educational Policy is funded by the State of Tennessee
                        as one of five Centers of Excellence located at The University of Memphis. CREP's
                        mission is to implement a research agenda associated with educational policies and
                        practices in the preK-12 public schools of Tennessee and the nation and to provide
                        a knowledge base for use by educational practitioners and policymakers. Research outcomes
                        are intended not only to describe the complexities of educational phenomena, but also
                        to offer recommendations for action.
                     
                     
                     Since 1989, the Center has served as a mechanism for mobilizing community and university
                        resources to address educational problems and to meet the University's commitment
                        to primary and secondary schools. The Center's research agenda is developed through
                        analysis of persistent or emerging issues in schools and their communities, changes
                        occurring in teacher education programs, and recommendations from educational authorities.
                        In the past decade, CREP has gained national recognition for its contribution to discussions
                        of issues such as reform of teacher education, educational equity, educational technology,
                        school reform and restructuring, urban and multicultural education, interventions
                        for at-risk students, and using formative evaluation methods for school improvement
                        decision-making.
