                     CASE Recognizes UofM with Educational Fundraising Award
                     
                     August 25, 2015 - The University of Memphis has received the 2015 Educational Fundraising
                        Award from CASE (Council for Advancement and Support of Education).
                     
                     
                     The UofM was selected to receive an Overall Performance award based on a three-year
                        analysis of fundraising data submitted to CASE for Aid to Education's annual Voluntary
                        Support of Education Survey.
                     
                     
                     The University set a fundraising record during the fiscal year that ended June 30,
                        securing nearly $38 million in gifts and commitments. The total includes cash, pledges
                        and planned gifts to the University of Memphis Foundation, and gifts-in-kind and private
                        grants to the UofM and University of Memphis Research Foundation.
                     
                     
                     "We appreciate the Council for Advancement and Support of Education for selecting
                        the UofM for the 2015 Educational Fundraising Award," said Bobby Prince, UofM chief
                        development officer. "We are especially grateful to our donors. Their support of the
                        University makes recognition like this – and so much more – possible."
