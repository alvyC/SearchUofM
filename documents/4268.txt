                     Project Description: Integration of user generated content within professional journalism space creates
                        a new platform for citizens to get engaged with news, affect public agenda, and contribute
                        to public discourse and opinions. The rising practice of opening up "below the line"
                        comment fields, as one type of UGC (user generated content), is changing the journalism
                        landscape within the traditional media. However, Research into "below the line" comment
                        fields remains limited. This study focuses on scrutinizing the quality of comment
                        fields by examining to what extent such a practice has enhanced the public discussion
                        of important issues. Specifically, the study selects to examine how citizens responded
                        to the articles on the Senkaku Islands dispute published in the Diplomat online news
                        website from April, 2012 to Dec. 2013. From the theoretical perspective of net-public
                        deliberation of political talk, the study aims to address research questions on deliberative
                        talk versus emotional discharge in comment fields. Modelling after Graham and Wright's
                        (2015) approach to investigating the UN Climate Change Summit, this study will content
                        analyze the comment fields based on the following characteristics: interaction, behavior
                        functions, posting rate and sources cited.
                     
                     
                     Requirement for Student Applicants: 
                     
                     The student applicants will help with the researcher to code the "below the line"
                        comment fields as coders. The first phase of the coding will involve training. The
                        second phase will be to compare codes and improve coding rules. The third phase will
                        be formal coding. The sequential steps of coding will allow undergraduate students
                        to learn from the researcher how to be a good content analyze researcher. At the same
                        time, they will gain some insight into how media content, or user generated content,
                        is interpreted by the public.
                     
                     
                     Stating Date: Jan. 19, 2015 or Jan. 25. 2015 to whenever the coding is completed.
                        It is estimated that a total of 50 to 60 hours might be needed.
                     
                     
                     Method of Compensation: Academic credits or volunteer chance will be considered depending
                        on students' preference. This project itself has no grant or funding, therefore, stipend
                        can't be incorporated. But this is a good opportunity for students to learn research
                        by doing the hands-on coding with the researcher.
