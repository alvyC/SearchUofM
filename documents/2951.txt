				Posted on November 9, 2015  by  Jessica Johnson			
			
					

				
			Whether you are selling your mobile device for cash or upgrading to a new phone, it is important to delete any personal information stored on your phone.
Remove Personal Information
Your phone holds phone numbers, text messages, passwords, email, and other personal information. There are a few things that you can do to keep this information out of the wrong hands. You may want to save and transfer your information to your new device before wiping your old one.

Factory reset (hard reset) your device to wipe the internal memory.
Erase or remove your SD card.
Remove you SIM card; you may decide to transfer it to your new device.

Double Check
After you have removed your personal information, it is a good idea to check that it is gone. Check your:

Contacts
Emails and text messages
Photos
Voicemails
Downloads

What Now?
Now that your mobile device is free of personal information, there are a few ways you can dispose of it.

Recycle your device – Check with your carrier or visit the websites for the EPA or CTIA .
Donate your device.
Trade in your device for a discount on a new one.
Resell your device.

Before disposing or any electronics, check EPA and local health and sanitation recommendations.

						Longer Laptop Battery Life
			
						
				Posted on October 7, 2015  by  Jessica Johnson			
			
					

				
			Laptops allow you to get work done no matter where you are. The only downside is your laptop won’t last all day once you unplug it. Here are a few ways to help your battery go the distance.

Is your battery fully charged? Before you take your laptop with you on the go, make sure the battery is fully charged. Laptops can take several hours to charge, so let your laptop charge overnight.
Use battery saver mode. Your laptop comes with built-in power management settings. These settings will help to optimize battery life by reducing power consumption.
Turn off anything you aren’t using. External devices and features such as Bluetooth drain your battery. You can extend your battery life by unplugging or disabling anything you aren’t using; this includes Wi-Fi.
Don’t multitask. Running several programs at once requires more processing powers which drains more power. Working on one task at a time will help your battery last longer. You can also try using software that use less features. For example you can type in a simple text file instead of a Word Document.

Other Options

Defrag your hard drive so your system operates more efficiently.
Upgrade to a solid-state drive which saves energy by using flash memory instead of moving parts.
Buy an extra battery to take with you on the go.
