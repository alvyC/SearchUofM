                        Check with University Records Officer to determine space availability.
                        
                        Use only regulation storage boxes (see US Office Products catalog, stock number FEL12772
                           or FEL00709 for examples).
                        
                        
                        Check files for duplicates, inconsequential data, paper clips, etc; these should be
                           removed prior to transfer of records from files to storage boxes.
                        
                        
                        Arrange folders in boxes exactly as they were arranged in your files.
                        
                        Leave a 1" working space in the front of each storage box.
                        
                        Label containers explicitly in the following manner: number each box consecutively
                           beginning with the last two digits of the current fiscal year and ending with the
                           number of the box.
                        
                        
                        EXAMPLE: If this box is the tenth box being transferred to the Records Storage Center
                           in fiscal year 2000-01, the number of the box will be 01-10.
                        
                        
                        ALTERNATE METHODS OF LABELING BOXES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE UNIVERSITY RECORDS OFFICER.
                        
                        Indicate destruction date; to determine destruction date, add retention time to fiscal
                           year in which record was created. If record covers two time periods such as 2000-01,
                           use second half of period when making computation.
                        
                        
                        Complete the Transmittal of Records to University Records Center form . Forward one copy to the University Records Officer, Administration Building, Room
                           367. Retain second copy for departmental files.
                        
                        
                        Contact the University Records Officer for access to the Records Storage Center.
                        
                     
                     
                     The department Head/Activity Manager or his/her designee will coordinate transfer
                        of the records to the Records Storage Center and will ensure they are stored in the
                        correct location and that the storage area and building are secured upon exit.
