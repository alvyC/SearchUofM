                     A number of camps, competitions and campus days are available for students to participate
                        in at the University of Memphis. Offerings include general science, computer science,
                        STEM and engineering. We are constantly looking for new opportunities for students
                        K-12 that are being offered on the campus so this site changes frequently.
