                     The University of Memphis takes cheating and inappropriate academic conduct very seriously.
                        Our policy on academic integrity is outlined in the Student Code of Rights and Responsibilities . In order to understand what academic misconduct means at the University, you should be familiar with the University's definitions
                        from the Office of Student Conduct.
                     
                     
                     To help in the pursuit of academic integrity, two products have been made available
                        to instructors: Turnitin and Respondus LockDown Browser.
                     
                     
                     Turnitin
                     
                     A web-based plagiarism-detection service that allows students to submit papers to
                        check for originality. Turnitin can be used as a deterrent, but also as an educational
                        tool to teach students how to work with sources and to improve paraphrasing and quoting
                        skills. After submission, an Originality Report is generated and the instructor can choose to share this with the student. The repository
                        to which papers are compared for originality currently consists of three primary databases .
                     
                     
                     Respondus LockDown Browser
                     
                     A custom browser that locks down the testing environment in eCourseware. When students
                        use LockDown Browser to access a quiz, they are unable to print, copy, go to another
                        URL, access other applications, or close a quiz until it is submitted for grading.
                        Tests created for use with LockDown Browser cannot be accessed with standard browsers
                        either. LockDown Browser works much like a standard browser, but some options have been removed or work differently .
                     
                     
                     Where Do I Begin?
                     
                     
                        
                        If a class will be using either product, the instructor will note this within the
                           syllabus and/or discuss it in class.
                        
                        
                        Once an assignment or quiz has been noted as using Turnitin or the LockDown Browser,
                           continue to the "Next Steps" section to ensure familiarity with the product and how
                           to use it.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Next Steps
                     
                     
                        
                        Turnitin
                           
                           
                              
                              If a class uses eCourseware, the chance is good that assignments will be submitted
                                 using the Dropbox feature within the class.
                              
                              
                              If an instructor is not using eCourseware, the Student Quick Start Guide goes through the steps of submitting the first paper.
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        Respondus LockDown Browser
                           
                           
                              
                              The LockDown Browser will only be used for assessments taken within eCourseware. Some
                                 instructors choose to use the browser, others do not; instructors will tell their
                                 class if it will be used.
                              
                              
                              Students will install the browser by clicking on the link within their eCourseware
                                 course. Once it has been installed, an icon will be available on your desktop. This
                                 icon will allow access to elearn.memphis.edu through the LockDown Browser but no other
                                 programs.
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                     
                     
                      View the General installation instructions from Respondus. You will only need to download the browser once per semester.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: Be sure to save your answers frequently in case you experience trouble.
