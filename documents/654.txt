                     About Campus Card
                     
                     The University of Memphis issues each student, faculty and staff member an identification
                        card that bears their name and image, referred to as your Campus Card. This permanent
                        identification card is used as the primary campus-wide method of determining privileges
                        and accesses. Students must be currently enrolled and a photo identification (such
                        as driver's license or passport) is required to have a Campus Card made.
                     
                     
                     The Campus Card remains the property of The University of Memphis and should be surrendered
                        upon the request of a University official. Students, faculty or staff members may
                        possess only ONE Campus Card at any time.
