        Frosh Camp 
    


        Who We Are:

Frosh Camp is a four-day, extended orientation program that takes place at Camp NaCoMe in middle Tennessee.  Frosh Camp eases the transition to college by providing students with an opportunity to get more involved, learn about the University of Memphis, and set goals for college in the tranquility of the great outdoors, all while developing strong relationships with other incoming students and upperclassmen mentors.   At Frosh Camp, you meet people who will radically influence your college years – classmates, friends, and supporters who will make and shape your experience at the University of Memphis.  It is truly an unforgettable experience that you’ll remember for the rest of your life!  

How Your Support Will Help:

While you know that Frosh Camp offers a remarkable extended orientation program, it is also an expensive program to host.  Transporting nearly 750 campers to and from Camp NaCoMe, feeding hundreds of hungry college students, and gathering supplies for counselor sessions and activities all add to create a significant cost to the program.  And although the little things like bug spray, sunscreen, and hand sanitizer can be bought in bulk, it all comes at a cost. 

All in all, it costs $85 to attend Frosh Camp as an incoming freshman.  Although this is an affordable cost, our goal is to maintain the affordability of Frosh Camp so that this one-of-a-kind experience is available to students for decades to come.   With the rising operational costs of hosting camp, it is important now than ever before that we support the program that has given so much to so many Memphis Tigers.  Donations will provide the funds to accommodate needs of the students, offset costs to counselors, and help provide an overall better experience for freshmen campers.
