                     Nashville-based artist/educator and exhibition judge Michael Aurbach will reflect
                        on the past three decades of his career. Aurbach is best known for his socially inspired
                        sculptures that address issues of identity, death, institutional power and contemporary
                        forms of scholarship. He has been the recipient of numerous grants and awards. Among
                        the institutions and foundations that have provided support for his work are the National
                        Endowment for the Arts, the Southern Arts Federation, the Tennessee Arts Commission,
                        Art Matters Inc., the Puffin Foundation, the Beren Foundation and Vanderbilt University.
                        From 2002-04, he served as president of the College Art Association, the world's largest
                        organization of visual arts professionals. In December, Aurbach retired as professor
                        of fine arts at Vanderbilt University, having taught sculpture and drawing since 1986.
