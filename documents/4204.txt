                     Adverse Events
                     
                     New findings are unexpected problems whose nature, severity, and frequency are not
                        described in the information provided to the IRB or to participants. Examples include
                        unexpected complications in a subject, missteps in the consent documentation, or breaches
                        of confidentiality. Adverse events should be reported to the IRB within 10 calendar
                        days using the Subsequent Event Form and Guidelines found on the Forms page. Sometimes a study must be suspended to ensure subjects' safety.
                     
                     
                     The report of the event should discuss:
                     
                     
                        
                        the facts of the case, including the date and a description of the subject;
                        
                        whether the event is related to the study's procedures or drugs or to the subject's
                           underlying disease or condition;
                        
                        
                        the steps that have been taken to address the problem;
                        
                        whether the event is likely to recur; and whether the event provides new information
                           about the study's risks that should be conveyed to participants, in a revised consent
                           form.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     These reports usually receive expedited review, but in some cases the full IRB is
                        involved.
                     
                     
                     The University's policies on adverse events are based on Food and Drug Administration
                        regulations. According to the FDA, a "serious adverse drug experience" with respect
                        to human clinical experience includes "any experience that suggests a significant
                        hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution," including "any experience that
                        is fatal or life-threatening, is permanently disabling, requires inpatient hospitalization,
                        or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose." An "unexpected adverse experience"
                        is any adverse experience whose nature, severity, and frequency of risk are not described
                        in the information provided for IRB review or in the consent form.
