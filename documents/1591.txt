                     The University of Memphis (U of M)  is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) . The SACS Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) provides assurance to students, parents and all stakeholders that the U of M meets
                        clear quality standards for educational and financial performance. In addition to
                        SACS accreditation, many of the academic programs at the U of M carry specialized
                        accreditation specific to the field. To learn more about additional accreditation
                        requirements, please contact the academic department that offers the program.
                     
                     
                     State Authorization
                     
                     The U of M seeks to deliver all of our online programs in every state through the
                        State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement. We work through the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) process to ensure that our programs are authorized to be offered in SARA-member states.
                        Tennessee is a member of SARA and the U of M is an approved SARA institution. As such,
                        we adhere to an established common set of standards for offering post-secondary distance
                        education among member states, districts and territories. Participation in SARA is
                        intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary
                        institutions based in another state.
                     
                     
                     Authorization of distance education is a dynamic environment and prospective students should check this site often for updates . The U of M is currently authorized to offer online degree programs these SARA member states . It is the student's responsibility to understand current circumstances or special
                           requirements in their state of residence . For more information about SARA, please visit http://www.nc-sara.org/ .​
                     
                     
                     Professional Licensure
                     
                     Important Note for Prospective Students: If you are considering an academic program that leads to a professional license in your state, it is highly recommended that you first seek guidance from the appropriate licensing agency in your home state BEFORE beginning the academic program located outside your state. It is the student's responsibility to contact the appropriate licensing board in their
                           home state to confirm whether a U of M program will meet the requirements for licensure
                           in that state.
                     
                     Important note for students interested in pursuing professional educator programs: Educator licensure and certification are regulated individually by State Departments
                        of Education and no two are exactly alike. Students who seek admission to a U of M
                        College of Education online program for endorsement or initial educator certification
                        in their home state should contact their home state's Department of Education for
                        applicable requirements rules and regulations. Students are responsible for determining
                        whether the online College of Education program will meet their home states' requirements
                        for certification, licensure, or otherwise advancing a student's teaching or administrator
                        credentials.
                     
                     
                     Complaint Resolution
                     
                     We greatly value our student experience and urge all students to adhere to the Student Code of Conduct . Please refer to this website for student expectations and student rights, http://www.memphis.edu/studentconduct/ .
                     
                     
                     When an issue is brought to our attention, the UofM will take appropriate action to
                        seek resolution. Students are encouraged to pursue the U of M's internal grievance
                        procedures for any complaints before contacting external sources for resolution. Often,
                        it is the case that communication with the course instructor is the most direct route to resolving issues . If an issue cannot be resolved at that level, a student may contact the academic
                        unit for guidance. If grievances are not satisfactorily resolved by the academic unit, students may file
                           a formal complaint through the UofM Dean of Students at http://www.memphis.edu/studentlife/scc_form.php .
                     
                     If grievances are not satisfactorily resolved after an internal attempt by the University,
                           a complaint may be filed with an agency in the student's state of residence.
