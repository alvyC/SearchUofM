                        a dean. Programs are offered at both the Memphis and Lambuth (Jackson, TN) campuses.
                        The curriculum leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing includes general
                        education and support courses offered through other units of the university as well
                        as the major requirements offered by the school. A comprehensive approach to health
                        care is emphasized through utilization of a wide variety of health care settings available
                        in Memphis and Jackson, and their surrounding communities.
                     
                     
                     The faculty of the Loewenberg College of Nursing represents all clinical areas of
                        nursing practice and a variety of experiences and interests. They reflect this diversity
                        in their teaching, practice and research and are qualified by practical experience
                        as well as by academic credentials, to function as facilitators of learning.
                     
                     
                     The Loewenberg College of Nursing holds membership in the American Association of
                        Colleges of Nursing, Southern Council for Collegiate Education in Nursing, and the
                        National League for Nursing Council for Baccalaureate and Higher Degree Programs.
                        All nursing programs are fully accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing

                     Because the University of Memphis seeks to provide in as much as possible a reasonably
                        safe environment for its health career students and their patients, students may be
                        required during the course of the program to demonstrate their physical and/or emotional
                        fitness to meet the essential requirements of the program. Such essential requirements
                        include freedom from communicable diseases, the ability to perform certain physical
                        tasks, and suitable emotional fitness. Any appraisal measures used to determine such
                        physical and/or emotional fitness will be in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
                        Act of 1973 and the American with Disabilities Act of 1990, so as not to discriminate
                        against any individual on the basis of disability. See specific criteria under Sophomore

                     BSN Admission Selection Process
                     
                     1. All students admitted to LCON as freshmen who meet the BSN admission criteria by
                        the second semester of the sophomore year matriculate in the nursing program.Â 
                     
                     
                     2. After freshmen nursing majors have been selected, all other BSN applicants are
                        considered on a competitive space available basis for the Memphis and Lambuth campuses.
                     
                     
                     3.For each campus, applicants are rank-ordered by cumulative GPA (40%), weighted Science
                        GPA (40%), and weighted Math grade (20%).
                     
                     
                     Â Â Â Â  a. A minimum of two science courses are used to calculate the Science GPA; general
                        science grades (for science majors) are used if two or more science prerequisites
                        are in-progress. The highest weight is applied to the Science GPA derived from all
                        three prerequisite science courses. The lowest weight is applied to the Science GPA
                        derived from two general science courses (for science majors).Â  Consideration will
                        be given to those students who completed all science pre- requisites and meet the
                        required GPA at the time of application.
                     
                     
                     Â Â Â Â  b. For students who complete more than one math course, the higher course grade
                        is used to calculate the weighted Math grade. The highest weight is applied to the
                        Math 1530, 1710, 1730, 1830, or 1910 course grade. A lower weight is applied to the
                        Math 1420 course grade.
                     
                     
                     4. An alternate list may be established each semester to fill vacancies that might
                        occur before the beginning of class. The rank order for the alternate list is applied
                        similarly to the acceptance list. 5. Students who are not accepted must reapply to be considered for another admission
                        cycle.Â 
                     
                     
                     6. Freshman admission students must have complete files by May 1.
                     
                     7. Sophomore and Accelerated BSN students must have complete files by the deadline
                        (February 15 for Fall; October 1 for Spring) to be considered.
