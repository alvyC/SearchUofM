                     Early Care and Learning
                     
                     The Early Care and Learning (ECL) emphasis provides a foundation for a career in working
                        with young children (0-4) in early care and education and other applied settings.
                     
                     
                     Students who choose the ECL emphasis are expected to develop knowledge and skills
                        in child development and learning, observation and assessment, pedagogy and research
                        through classroom and field experiences. Students will be prepared for employment
                        in a discipline working with children and families, and may pursue graduate training
                        that leads to careers in education, academia, research, health professions, or social
                        work.
