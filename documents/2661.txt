                     We offer exciting B.S. and M.S. programs in general physics and materials science.
                        The moderate size of our department allows our faculty to work with students one-on-one
                        to meet the individual needs and interests of each student. Our students have excellent
                        working relationships with faculty in a training atmosphere that is often difficult
                        to attain at larger institutions.
                     
                     
                     Our faculty conducts advanced research in Nanotechnology, Nanomaterials, Energy Materials,
                        Space Materials, Biomaterials, Nano- and Bio-Photonics, Computational and Theoretical
                        Physics, Astrophysics, and Physics Education. These forefront research projects and
                        our state-of-the-art facilities provide unique research opportunities for both undergraduate
                        and graduate students. We consider undergraduate research experience as a vital part
                        in the education of our physics majors. Our undergraduate students may participate
                        in research as early as their freshman year.
