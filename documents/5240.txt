                     We also serve as a student development board, assisting the Office of Annual Giving
                        in raising awareness about the impact of private giving at The University of Memphis.
                        Council members get a first-hand look at fundraising operations for the University
                        and work actively with the Development team on marketing campaigns, events and other
                        activities.
