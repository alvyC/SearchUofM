                     University of Memphis School of Law Professor and Associate Dean of Academic Affairs,
                        Steve Mulroy spoke with several media outlets regarding a number of recent issues
                        in the news, such as the recent Supreme Court of the United States decisions regarding
                        the Affordable Healthcare Act, the Court's ruling on gay marriage equality, the removal
                        of a Confederate statue from a local park and several issues surrounding the recent
                        deaths of citizens in the Mid-South who were in police custody at the time of their
                        passing. 
                     
                     
                     Additionally, Professor Mulroy officiated the wedding of a local, same-sex couple
                        at the the Memphis Gay and Lesbian Community Center on the same day that the SCOTUS
                        ruling was announced.
