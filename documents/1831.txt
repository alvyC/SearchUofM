                     University of Memphis Interprets do it Instructions
                     
                     February 26, 2016- The Art Museum of the University of Memphis, in collaboration with
                        UofM Lambuth and Crosstown Arts, will present more than two dozen interpretations
                        of do it instructions.
                     
                     
                     In the early '90s, international curator Hans Ulrich Obrist and artists Bertrand Lavier
                        and Christian Boltanski hypothesized a flexible and open-ended art exhibition. Could
                        "scores" or written instructions by artists be interpreted anew every time they were
                        enacted? Twenty years later the exhibition they came to call do it grew to include instructions by nearly 300 artists, choreographers, writers and poets
                        that have been featured in more than 50 exhibitions worldwide.
                     
                     
                     do it instructions will be presented this spring in the form of realized objects, performances
                        and public engagement from Memphis to Jackson, Tenn. The dates for the exhibit are
                        March 4-April 2 at Crosstown Arts, 422 N. Cleveland; April 9-May 7 at the Art Museum
                        of the University of Memphis (AMUM); and March 17 from 4 to 6 p.m. at UofM Lambuth,
                        Varnell-Jones Hall, Wisdom Parlor.
                     
                     
                     Crosstown Arts will host an opening reception Friday, March 4, from 6 to 9 p.m. and
                        an artist talk and performance Saturday, March 5, from 5 to 7 p.m. There will be an
                        opening reception at AMUM Friday, April 8, from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m.
                     
                     
                     The AMUM project, sponsored by the Student Activity Fee Fund, identified two curators/project
                        managers to organize do it on the UofM campuses and in their respective communities. Curators Hamlett Dobbins
