                        MSW students must complete a minimum of 960 clock hours of field placement. 400 hours
                           are completed in the foundation field placement sequence: SWRK 7051-7052. 560 hours
                           are completed in the concentration field placement sequence: SWRK 7053-7054. MSW students
                           must apply and be accepted into the Teacher Education Program. In addition, they must
                           obtain a background check and at least 1 million/3 million dollars professional liability
                           insurance via a reputable organization or company that provides coverage for social
                           workers prior to placement in the field. Students should also review the student field
                           manual and student handbook for information regarding the requirements for liability
                           insurance coverage. The MSW program requires that students get two different field
                           experiences in their foundation and concentration years. Therefore, students are not
                           allowed to complete both field placements at the same agency. Students seeking school
                           social work licensure will complete their concentration year field placement in a
                           school setting. Table 3 outlines the link between Tennessee School Social Work licensure
                           standards, field placement requirements course, and field placement assessments.
