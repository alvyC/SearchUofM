                     Race, Class, and Social Justice in Memphis: A Call to Bridge the Great Divide
                     
                     The 2016 Hooks Institute policy papers use Memphis and Shelby County as a starting
                        point to discuss, and propose solutions to, national issues of race, class, and public
                        policy. "The Long Way to a Safer Memphis: Local Policies for Crime Prevention Need
                        Structural Change", written by Simone Tulumello, Ph.D. (Doctoral Research Fellow,
                        University of Lisbon, Portugal), looks at the need for sound structural policy changes
                        in order to create flourishing communities, as a reliance on the policing of minority
                        and poor communities will not do so. "Transportation, Urban, Form, and Social Justice

                        City and Regional Planning, UofM), calls for us to rethink public transportation,
                        claiming a lack of efficient and reliable public transportation limits the ability
                        of the poor to improve their economic standing and harms the economic growth of Memphis
                        and Shelby County. "Ideology and Division: How We Got Here, How Do We Get Back? The
                        Search for Unity", written by Eric Groenendyk, Ph.D. (Associate Professor, Department
                        of Political Science, UofM), insists we are not as politically divided as we seem;
                        believing if we focused on communal and individual needs, rather than ideology alone,
                        we would find more in common than we think.

                     Our History
                     
                     With the approval of the Tennessee Board of Regents and funding from the United States
                        Congress and the State of Tennessee, the Hooks Institute was created in 1996. It was
                        founded by Benjamin Hooks and the Department of Political Science and College of Arts
                        and Sciences at the University of Memphis. Together, their common goal for the Institute
                        was to play a pivotal role in framing and solving community problems through the wisdom
                        and vision of pioneers such as Benjamin L. Hooks.
