                     PhD in Accounting
                     
                     We are not admitting PhD students for Fall 2016.
                     
                     The PhD is a research degree and is not a direct continuation of masters' level studies;
                        that is, candidates learn to extend the frontiers of knowledge through original investigation
                        and publication of findings. University faculty members also communicate knowledge
                        through teaching and are expected to perform service to their institution, profession,
                        and community. The relative weights of these assignments vary across institutions.
                     
                     
                     Specifically, the program intends to:
                     
                     
                        
                        provide candidates with an advanced level of knowledge in accounting and non-accounting
                           topics as well as an emphasis in a chosen accounting specialization;
                        
                        
                        prepare candidates to conduct independent research;
                        
                        enable candidates to communicate their research findings effectively;
                        
                        aid candidates in developing interpersonal and technical skills in teaching.
                        
                        The Accounting concentration emphasizes empirical research. This program is eclectic
                           in nature with the premise that a candidate should possess:
                        
                        
                        broad knowledge of past and current theoretical and methodological accounting issues;
                        
                        in-depth knowledge of a supporting area; and
                        
                        proficiency in statistics, economics, and quantitative methods of analysis.
                        
                     
                     
                     These skills will allow a candidate to conduct significant research and contribute
                        to the advancement of knowledge in accounting. The PhD program is a learning process
                        in which a candidate gains an understanding of and the ability to do scholarly research.
                        This process is holistic as it involves clearly linked interactions among faculty
                        and students in courses, in workshops, in teaching, and in individual research projects.
                     
                     
                     The PhD faculty have earned a strong national reputation. Research by current faculty
                        members scheduled to teach in the program has appeared in leading journals, including
                        The Accounting Review ; Journal of Accounting Research ; Journal of Accounting and Economics ; Contemporary Accounting Research ; Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting ; Auditing: A Journal of Practice and Theory ; Accounting , Organizations & Society ; Journal of Taxation ; The Journal of Accounting Education ; and Issues in Accounting Education .
                     
                     
                     Choosing to enter a PhD program typically signals a substantial career change, and
                        requires one's full professional attention. Accordingly, part-time students will not
                        be accepted in the Accounting program. In order to become engaged in the research
                        and teaching environment, students who are admitted normally will qualify for a graduate
                        assistantship.
