alumni association Member Spotlight 


Scott Vann (BPS '10, MALS '13)
"I feel it's important to be a member of the Alumni Association because it keeps you engaged with the UofM for a lifetime. I have thoroughly enjoyed socializing with fellow Tiger fans and alumni at events hosted by the Alumni Association, especially tailgating! I believe staying engaged with the Alumni Association not only helps enhance the prestige of the University, but it also increases the value of your degree. You can't beat the member discounts and numerous benefits that are included with your membership."
Scott Vann's love for the University of Memphis began many years ago, when he was simply "a young Tiger fan." Vann has always been a supporter of Tiger Athletics. He fondly remembers cheering for the school's teams through wins and losses, good years, as well as bad.
Vann began his studies at Northwest Mississippi Community College before transferring to the University of Memphis. His move to the UofM was transformational. One of his professors at Northwest noted that he was the "ultimate poster student for the University of Memphis," commenting that he exemplified the school's then-motto -- observing that he was indeed a dreamer, a thinker and a doer. Vann graduated with a BPS in Information Technology in 2010.
After receiving his master's degree from the UofM in 2013, Vann accepted a position at Austin Peay State University, where he worked in Instructional Technology. Two years later, he returned to campus and accepted a position in The Center for Teaching and Learning. He currently assists faculty and students with the various instructional technologies that are used at UofM. Vann is currently pursing an EdD in Instruction and Curriculum Leadership, with a concentration in Instructional Design and Technology.
While a student at UofM, Vann met his wife, Yanhua, who worked for the Confucius Institute at the University of Memphis. Scott and Yanhua are now proud parents to a tiny Tiger fan, Jacob. Jacob was born just a few weeks ago, and already has a drawer full of Tiger Blue. He is looking forward to taking Jacob to Memphis games and hoping that his son will follow in his footsteps and someday be "Driven by Doing."
