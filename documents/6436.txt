                        challenges in urban design and community development. The Design Collaborative developed
                        from a partnership between the University of Memphis and the Memphis Regional Design
                        Center.
                     
                     
                     Through its interdisciplinary strengths, the Design Collaborative will connect building
                        and site design to community improvement in a comprehensive way, supported by the
                        kind of collaboration that a university setting can facilitate. The Design Collaborative
                        will seek to make the relationship between citizens and the city (as a physical, social,
                        and economic entity) work better.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Design Collaborative activities will be:
                     
                     
                        
                        Built on collaboration, with partnerships between different disciplines at the University,
                           and partnerships between the University and the community (including grassroots organizations,
                           non-profits, practitioners, philanthropists, and local government).
                        
                        
                        Forward-thinking and focused on what we want Memphis to be
                        
                        Comprehensive, so that we're promoting public projects that complement each other
                           and drive a common community objective
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     The Design Collaborative will start taking on projects next fall through a structure
                        of graduate studio courses. A series of events this spring will help set the agenda
                        for those projects.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Let's Stay Together, Memphis!
                     
                     
                     
                     What is relationship therapy for the city and its citizens?
                     
                     The bottom line is that we're all in a long-term relationship with the city that we
                        live in. We want to make the relationship between citizens and the city (as a physical,
                        social, and economic entity) work better!
                     
                     
                     A real relationship is deeper than just the good things. Whether times are good or
                        bad happy or sad... a real relationship requires communication, understanding, and
                        a desire and willingness to work through the difficult issues.
                     
                     
                     The UMDC (as the therapist) wants to help develop projects and plans that will help
                        our city be more responsive to the needs and preferences of its citizens.
                     
                     
                     To get there, we need to understand the perspectives of the citizens.
                     
                     We need to know what you love, what frustrates you, and where you see this relationship
                        going. By answering these questions, you'll be contributing to a comprehensive understanding
                        of Memphis' assets and liabilities a to a common comprehensive vision for our future.
