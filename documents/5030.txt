                     Research Interests: Machine learning, artificial intelligence
                     
                     
                     Dr. Deepak Venugopal joined the Department as an assistant professor in Fall 2015
                        after completing his PhD in computer science at the University of Texas at Dallas.
                        Dr. Venugopal's primary research interest is in developing fast, scalable, and accurate
                        algorithms for inference and learning in probabilistic graphical models and their
                        first-order extensions such as Markov Logic Networks. His work has resulted in key
                        techniques that lift approximate inference methods to first-order models and has been
                        published in several top-tier conferences in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence,
                        such as NIPS, AAAI, UAI, and EMNLP.
