                     A constant concern of management information systems (MIS) researchers and practitioners
                     has been improving user satisfaction with the information services function (USISF).
                     Due to the growth of end-user computing, decentralization, and alternative sources
                     of supply, an organization's information services function (ISF) is now faced with
                     serving customers that possess substantial discretion in their use and purchase of
                     information systems (IS) services. This increasingly market-oriented environment demands
                     sensitivity to IS customers' expectations and perceived value of ISF services. One
                     important source of guidance in such an IS management environment is to look at marketing
                     literature for frameworks that may permit the ISF to more effectively determine and
                     convey the value of their services. Recognizing the need to improve existing MIS measures
                     of user satisfaction with the ISF, this study adapts the SERVQUAL measure from marketing
                     to provide more specific information about user satisfaction with the information
                     service function. It was found that, while the three original dimensions of the traditional
                     user information satisfaction (UIS) measure remain strong predictors of overall ISF
                     user satisfaction, two aspects of IS service quality, "reliability" and "empathy,"
                     are also significant predictors. The results suggest that the original dimensions
                     of UIS may not be comprehensive enough to capture the more detailed dimensions of
                     ISF service quality in SERVQUAL, and that the reliability and empathy dimensions of
                     service quality may be needed to supplement the traditional UIS measure in determining
                     user satisfaction with the information services function. Implications for research
                     and practice resulting from these findings are discussed.
