                        A recent study reported that Memphis is the deadliest major American city (of the
                        largest 25 largest cities) for African-American women with breast cancer.

                     Project Description:Â 
                     
                     This proposed project aims to conduct a community-scale monitoring program for polycyclic
                        aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ambient air in the Memphis TN-MS-AR Metropolitan
                        Statistical Area, a tri-state area that comprises West Tennessee, North Mississippi,
                        and the Arkansas Delta. The overall objective of this project is to delineate the
                        concentrations and distributions of PAHs, identify major sources of PAH air pollution,
                        characterize near-source PAH profiles, and assess non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic
                        risks for human exposure. This study will take a community-based participatory research
                        (CBPR) approach, in which community residents and organizations are engaged in all
                        phases of the study.Â

                     The aim of this study is to assess the ability of a hands-on diet and physical activity
                        summer camp (Living Healthy Summer Camp) to influence the diet and physical activity
                        behaviors of youth. Classes will include hands-on cooking and physical activity sessions
                        to introduce participants to new foods and activities with the goal of increasing
                        healthy diet and physical activity behaviors. Parents will be incorporated into the
                        program during booster sessions as well as through take-home assignments. Thirty students,
                        ages 9-14, will be recruited to participate in the intervention for 5 months. The
                        camp will start with recruitment Jan-May 2016, baseline data collection in May, weekly
                        emails sent to participants during June, a second data collection in July, camps the
                        weeks of July 18-22 & July 25-29, and booster sessions every other week in August
                        and September, with the final data collection the last week of September.
