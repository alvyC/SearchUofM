                        take the foreign language placement exam (if they have not already successfully completed
                        a language course at an accredited institution of higher education). For information
                        about the dates and place of placement exams, contact the Department of Foreign Languages
                        and Literatures. On the basis of the results of the placement exam, students should
                        follow these guidelines:
                     
                     
                     If placed into 1010: complete 1010, 1020, 2010, 2020

                        receive credit for 1010 in that language.
                     
                     
                     3. No credit hours are immediately granted on the basis of the placement exam.
                     
                     4. Satisfactory completion of the language requirement by means of the placement exam
                        will be noted on the student's transcript.
                     
                     
                     5. Students whose first college-level language course is 2010 or higher and who pass
                        this course with a minimum grade of "C" may apply for Credit by Course Placement.
                        The applicable fees are listed in the Miscellaneous Fees section of this Catalog.
                        Students wishing such credit must make written application to the chair of the Department
                        of Foreign Languages and Literatures. Credit by Course Placement shall apply only
                        to the lower division, and credit gained in this manner shall not exceed 12 semester
                        hours in any one language. For additional information, see Credit by Course Placement
                        in Section 5 of this Catalog.
                     
                     
                     6. Once a student begins with a lower-division course, all remaining higher-numbered
                        courses in the lower division must be taken in sequence, without skipping. For example,
                        students who begin with LATN 1010 cannot skip LATN 1020 and enroll in LATN 2010.
                     
                     
                     7. For students whose mother tongue is not English, lower-division credit in the native
                        language will be awarded when the student has successfully completed the English composition
                        requirement for graduation and has proven proficiency in the native language to the
                        satisfaction of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. The student must
                        make written application to the chair of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures.
                     
                     
                     Fine Arts: (Required only if a Fine Arts course was not taken to fulfill General Education
                        requirements): 3 hours from: ART 1030, ARTH 2010, ARTH 2020, COMM 1851, COMM 4850,
                        COMM 4858, DANC 1151, DANC 3101, MUS 1030, MUS 1040, MUHL 4800, THEA 1030, THEA 4551,
                        THEA 4552.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: The College of Arts and Sciences accepts a maximum of two semester hours in physical activity courses toward the fulfillment of its degree requirements.
                     
                     
                     To qualify for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the student must complete a minimum of
                        120 qualifying semester hours with a grade point average of 2.0. A minimum of 42 semester
                        hours must be in courses from the upper division. A minimum grade of "C" is required
                        in every course applicable toward a major or minor (including corequisites). A minimum
                        cumulative GPA of 2.0 is required for courses applied to the major. Every student
                        should be aware that the mere completion of course outlined below with a minimum grade
                        of "C" does not guarantee classification as a major or minor in the discipline concerned;
                        the student must be recommended by the chair of the department in which the major
                        or minor is sought. If, in the opinion of the department chair, the quality of the
                        student's work is not high enough, additional work, the repetition of courses, or
                        other evidence of acceptable scholarship may be required.
                     
                     
                     Residence Requirements
                     
                     University residence requirements are explained in detail in the Graduation from the
                        University section. A transfer student in The College of Arts and Sciences must earn
                        at least 6 semester hours in residence in the major subject and at least 3 semester
                        hours in the minor. These credits may be earned only through regular class enrollment
                        for a letter grade.
