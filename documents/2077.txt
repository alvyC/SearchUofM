        Social Work-Day on the Hill 
    


        The University of Memphis Department of Social Work has over 450 students in two academic programs: The Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Social Work and the Master of Social Work (MSW). University of Memphis prepares social work students to effectively intervene across multiple levels with clients, families, organizations, and communities. A critical part of social work education is preparation for effective advocacy. Please help us give our students hands-on experience with advocacy.
Each year in March, social work students, faculty, and practitioners travel to Nashville for Social Work Day on the Hill (SWDOTH). SWDOTH is a day of advocacy, presentations, and awards. Social work students have a hands-on opportunity to learn advocacy skills that they can use throughout their career. University of Memphis sends approximately 60-80 students and faculty per year to SWDOTH. University of Memphis students won the policy poster contests in 2007, 2011, and 2013. In 2015, University of Memphis students had the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on state policy when they testified in front of the House Subcommittee on Local Government on the topic of their policy poster, workplace bullying. 
With the growing size of our academic programs, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Department of Social Work to fund expenses related to SWDOTH. Your generous donation will help us ensure that a hands-on advocacy experience continues to be a part of University of Memphis social work education. All money raised will go to support SWDOTH. Please give today!
