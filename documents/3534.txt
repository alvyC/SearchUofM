                     The School of Public Health at the University of Memphis offers a unique opportunity
                        for attorneys to obtain a Master of Public Health degree in 12-months. Termed the
                        "Fast Track MPH," the MPH is earned in an intensive full-time format in which attorneys
                        attend classes during the evening and online for 3 consecutive semesters (fall, spring,
                        summer). As part of their coursework, students also complete a 240-hour community-based
                        practicum.
                     
                     
                     The 42-credit program is designed to allow attorneys to extend their advocacy skills
                        to a population health perspective and gain substantive knowledge in applying law
                        and policy to public health problems. Special expertise will be gained in urban public
                        health issues, health systems, public health policy, and environmental health advocacy.
                        The program prepares attorneys for leadership in addressing public health policy issues
                        related to access to healthcare, health reform, environmental justice, and social
                        concerns that affect health equity.
                     
                     
                     Eligible candidates must be graduates of the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law at the
                        University of Memphis or another American Bar Association-accredited U.S. law school.
