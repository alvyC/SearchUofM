                     Use this guide to interpret the results of your Look Up Classes search. Though many of column headings are straightforward, some are not and require
                        explanation. These are "bulleted" below.

                        Campus. Where the course is offered. 11M = the Main UofM campus, U28 = the Lambuth
                           campus, UPY = the Millington Center, and UGZ = the Collierville Center in Collierville.
                           To interpret the other codes, refer to the 3-digit codes used in the Campus field on the  Advanced Search  selection screen.

                        These codes are often used in combination. For example, TR means the course meets
                           Tuesdays and Thursdays; MWF means the course meets Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

                        Cross-listed Capacity. This will be 0 for most sections since most courses are not
                           cross-listed. "XL" headings pertain to a course/section on one level that is linked
                           to another course/section on a different level. EXAMPLE: In a 4000/6000 course, undergraduates
                           and graduates meet in the same classroom at the same time. Perhaps 20 seats are reserved
                           for the undergraduates and 10 for the graduates. "XL" columns provide figures for
                           each level's enrollment and seat availability.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     XL Act = Cross-listed Actual. The actual number of seats currently filled. 0 for all sections
                        that are not cross-listed.
                     
                     
                     XL Rem = Cross-listed Remaining. The number of seats still available. 0 for all sections that
                        are not cross-listed.

                        Session starting and ending dates. Pay close attention to this information: the dates
                           will tell you which Part of Term a section is being offered in. For instance, a Fall
                           section that begins in August and ends in October is a First Half-Term course; one
                           that begins in October and ends in December is a Second Half-Term course, and one
                           that begins in August and ends in December is a Full Term course.
