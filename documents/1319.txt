                        About Dr. Wilson
                        
                        For the past seven years, Dr. Jeffery Wilson has been a faculty member in the Leadership
                           Department's Higher and Adult Education Program at the University of Memphis. He completed
                           his doctoral studies in Higher Educational Leadership at the University of Nevada,
                           Las Vegas, received his masters degree in Student Affairs Administration at the University
                           of Nebraska-Lincoln, and did his undergrad at Virginia Commonwealth University. His
                           areas of research interest are college student affairs and diversity, specifically
                           leadership for diversity and campus climate.
                        
                        
                        Prior to coming to Memphis, Dr. Wilson worked in student affairs and enrollment services
                           and was a visiting assistant professor. Dr. Wilson enjoys the academic side of higher
                           education. Having worked in both settings, he understands the demands of the former
                           and the culture of the latter and brings those insights to any endeavor on which he
                           embarks. Dr. Wilson has an ambitious research agenda that is focused on diversity
                           as it relates to multicultural education, leadership, and institutional culture and
                           climate. Already, he has had several works to appear in the Journal of Diversity in
                           Higher Education, the Journal of College Student Development, and Innovative Higher
                           Education to name a few. His service includes membership to the editorial board of
                           the Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice, and the National Advisory Committee
                           for the National Conference on Race & Ethnicity in American Higher Education (NCORE).
                           Recently, Dr. Wilson was awarded the Tennessee Board of Regent's Maxine Smith Fellowship.
                           Dr. Wilson intends to continue building on his quest to be a diversity scholar while
                           at the University of Memphis and looks forward to seeing more of his students graduate
                           from the program and begin their own higher education pursuits.
