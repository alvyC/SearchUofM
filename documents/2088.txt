                     Passports Passports serve as an official identification while traveling to show proof of U.S.
                        citizenship. Passports are also needed before leaving and entering almost every country.
                        You will need to have a passport to leave and return to the United States. You can
                        find information about applying for or renewing a passport on the U.S. State Department
                        Consular Affairs website:  http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports.html . The application process takes about 6 weeks on average after the application has
                        been submitted; however, we have seen it take just over 2 months, so students should
                        apply for their passport when they apply for the program, if not earlier.

                     Visas A visa is a legal document granted by a foreign consulate that gives permission for
                        the student to study and live in the foreign country. Most summer program participants
                        do not need a visa, but there are a few exceptions. As a general rule, semester students
                        require a visa. The study abroad office can help students find out if they need a
                        visa and direct them to resources, such as the consulate of their host country abroad.
                        The study abroad office will offer some assistance; however, it is the student's responsibility
                        to obtain their visa. Students should contact the consulate directly to confirm they
                        are aware of all requirements. Students typically work on their visa after they are
                        accepted to the program, as they will need to provide documents from the host institution
                        to obtain the visa. Some countries require students to have a visa in‐person interview
                        at the consulate, which may mean a trip to Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago, Miami,
                        New Orleans, etc. For countries that require this, you will want to budget the cost
                        of this domestic trip in your total program price. While visa applications can be
                        a lot of work depending on the country, the sense of excitement and accomplishment
                        felt by students after receiving their visas further prepares students for their study
                        abroad experience.
