                     The Installment Payment Plan (IPP) is offered for the fall and spring terms to qualified
                        students to help satisfy payment requirements by the appropriate fee payment deadline.
                        Registration is subject to deletion and/or a $100 late payment fee, if fee payment
                        requirements for enrollment fees are not satisfied by the appropriate fee payment
                        deadline listed in the Bursar Calendar.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        The IPP is reserved for students in good financial standing with the University.
                        
                        
                        The IPP is available for Fall and Spring terms only.
                        
                        Regulations of the Tennessee Board of Regents prevent the University from offering
                           an IPP for summer terms, or other short terms.
                        
                        
                        An initial down payment of 25% of the balance is required after all financial aid (grants and student loans), scholarship, and/or third party
                              assistance award amounts have been applied. Housing, Dining Dollars, and a $50 enrollment fee
                           will automatically be included in IPP.
                        
                        
                        The enrollment fee is not refundable, regardless of when your financial aid or other
                           payments are applied to your account.
                        
                        
                        Students must first register for classes before enrolling in the IPP.
                        
                        Enrollment in the IPP is not automatic - students must enroll online through TigerXpress.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                              Follow these steps to sign up for the IPP:

                           This will take you into the TigerXpress system.
                           
                           
                           Go to Payment Plans and click the Enroll Now button.
                           
                           
                           Follow all instructions and prompts.  
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        Students may pay the full installment amount due (per term) online. Students who wish
                           to make a partial payment above the minimum down payment must pay in person at the Bursar's
                           Office cashier windows.
                        
                        
                        IPP enrollment is available through the late registration fee payment deadline at
                           the beginning of the Fall and Spring terms. Please refer to the Bursar's Office Calendar for specific dates.
                        
                        
                        The remaining fee balance is due in three separate installments: September 30, October
                           30, and November 30 in the Fall semester; February 28, March 30 and April 30 in the
                           Spring semester.
                        
                        
                        Students remain responsible for the installment payments by the appropriate deadline,
                           even if they do not receive or do not open their online fee invoice on TigerXpress.
                        
                        
                        A $25 Late Payment Fee will be assessed on each installment that is not received by
                           the University on or before the due date. If all installment payments are late, the
                           maximum amount for late IPP fees per semester is $75.
                        
                        
                        Before enrolling in the IPP, students will be required to read and accept terms of
                           the plan on TigerXpress.
                        
                        
                        Students who drop or withdraw from classes will still have a balance due under the
                           IPP. Fees are adjusted based on the drop or withdrawal date. A refund would only be
                           issued to the student if the newly adjusted amount of fees is less than the amount
                           that has been paid by the student.
                        
                        
                        Students who are current on their IPP and do not owe any other debts to the University
                           will be allowed to register for the upcoming term. If the final IPP installment for
                           the current term is not paid on or before the due date and the student is registered
                           for an upcoming term, the student's courses for the upcoming term will be subject
                           to deletion.
                        
                        
                        Unpaid past due installment amounts will cause holds to be placed on registration
                           for any upcoming term, viewing/receiving grades for current or future terms, or receiving
                           transcripts/diplomas.
                        
                        
                        The IPP is not available for students who were deleted for non-payment and have subsequently
                           been approved for reinstatement or who are registered late by exception.
                        
                        
                        The University reserves the right to deny students the privilege of using the IPP.
