                     The Benjamin Lawson Hooks Papers: An Introduction
                     
                     William C. Love
                     
                     In 1996, Dr. Benjamin Hooks, three years retired as Executive Director of the NAACP,
                        donated his professional papers to the University of Memphis Libraries. The time and
                        scope of the papers range from the mid-1970s when he served as commissioner of the
                        Federal Communications Commission to the early 2000s when Dr. Hooks worked with the
                        Hooks Institute for Social Change, an institute that continues to work from the University
                        of Memphis to teach, study, and promote Civil Rights and social change in the Memphis
                        area.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     The papers were given in installments to the University of Memphis Libraries between
                        1996 and 2006. The papers were processed and housed in 2007, with no new additions
                        arriving until 2015 when Dr. Hooks' daughter, Patricia Hooks, donated 4 boxes of manuscript
                        and audio/visual material. As the collection stands now, it contains 397 archival
                        boxes with close to 195,000 items that range from correspondence to printed material,
                        memoranda, administrative files, photographs, and audio/visual material.
