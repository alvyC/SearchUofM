                     Groups and decision makers are increasingly running headlong into complexity as interconnections
                        and interdependencies between individuals and organizations continue to grow, decision
                        time horizons shrink and more work is being performed by distributed teams. These
                        factors are driving up overall problem space complexity and limiting the effectiveness
                        of time-tested decision and collaboration processes. Increases in problem space complexity
                        lead to higher equivocality in collaborative processes and associated products. Electronic
                        collaboration support tools and associated process management schemes have proven
                        successful in many challenging contexts. However, current collaboration process management
                        schemes and tools may not be able to effectively handle more complex tasks. We posit
                        that heightened problem space complexity must be addressed with commensurate process
                        and technological support for collaborative efforts. To achieve truly agile collaborative
                        solutions, we propose Dynamic Collaboration -- a process management scheme that utilizes
                        group consensus, and process evolution via iterative process alignment and product
                        refinement phases to meet the challenges posed by complexity and equivocality.
