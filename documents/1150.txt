	   The UofM Alumni Association has regional clubs located in 13 states. After you leave campus to share your talents with the world,
the UofM Alumni Association is right beside you, keeping you connected to your fellow
Tigers.


We encourage each club to perform three functions:


    Networking : New to a city? Looking to hire fellow Tigers? Make a connection at a watch party or networking event!
    
    Service : Continue the Tiger tradition of making a positive impact wherever you are. Clubs have been active in service projects such as collecting school supplies for local students, sending "Holiday Mail for Heroes" and more.
    
    Student Recruitment : Help us recruit the best and brightest from across the country. Attend a recruitment event to meet the next generation of Tigers and share your experiences with them.
    

Select from the Regional Club list to the left to learn how you can connect with Tigers in your area.

Are we missing a club in your hometown? Contact us at alumniassociation@memphis.edu or 901.678.2586 to discuss forming a group!
 
Have you recently moved? Be sure to update your contact information to receive notifications about upcoming events in your area.
