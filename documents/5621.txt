                     UofM Receives Federal Grant to Improve Services for Students with Disabilities
                     
                     November 24, 2015 - The U.S. Department of Education, Office of Postsecondary Education,
                        has awarded the University of Memphis Institute on Disability (UMID) a five-year,
                        $1.5 million grant to expand inclusive postsecondary education training for students
                        with intellectual disabilities.
                     
                     
                     As a Transition and Postsecondary Education Program for Students with Intellectual
                        Disability (TPSID)-funded program, UMID will provide affordable vocational and independent
                        living training to more local transition-aged adults with intellectual disabilities
                        while participating in research related to improving their quality of life. UMID already
                        has negotiated expanding its services to more locations, including the University
                        of Memphis Lambuth, and will have the opportunity for additional growth with resources
                        from the grant.
                     
                     
                     "This was and will continue to be a team effort among folks from several disciplines
                        in the helping professions," said Dr. Chrisann Schiro-Geist, principal investigator
                        of the proposal. "The grant is called Building Resources for Persons with Intellectual
                        Disabilities Towards Gainful Employment (BRIDGE). Together with my associate director
                        from UMID, Maurice Williams, and my co-investigators, Kay Reese and Will Hunter, we
                        will facilitate our young adults with disabilities to cross that bridge to employment
                        and full inclusion in society."
                     
                     
                     Williams added, "The Institute on Disability is excited by its partnering with local
                        organizations on this project, such as the University of Tennessee Boling Center and
                        Shelby County Schools. These partnerships will allow the institute to improve its
                        services and engage in greater community outreach, ensuring that more individuals
                        with intellectual disabilities receive these valuable services than ever before."
                     
                     
                     UMID hosted the Tennessee Inclusive Postsecondary Education Alliance quarterly meeting
                        on the UofM campus Oct. 29-30. The meeting featured Madeline Will, former assistant
                        secretary of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services under President Ronald
                        Reagan.
