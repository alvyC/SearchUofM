                     The Memphis Woodwind Quintet is a faculty ensemble-in-residence at the University of Memphis. The quintet has
                        toured extensively in its 30 year history, including performances in more than 20
                        states and an appearance at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Displaying mastery and
                        sensitivity of musical styles of all eras, the ensemble possesses a remarkable sense
                        of expression and group harmony. The quintet brings together musicians of unusually
                        rich experience as soloists, chamber musicians, orchestral musicians and teachers.
