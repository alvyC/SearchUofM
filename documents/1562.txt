                     How Do I Become a CPA
                     
                     CPA… What do these three letters mean to the professional world? They mean you have received
                        a broad-based education. They mean you have passed all parts of a very difficult exam.
                        They mean you have the knowledge, skills and abilities to be a trusted business advisor
                        to your clients or employer. They mean you feel comfortable with the latest technology.
                        They mean you are an ethical individual who can provide an independent viewpoint.
                     
                     
                     Preparing for the Exam
                     
                     TTo become a CPA in Tennessee, candidates must obtain 150 semester hours of education
                        and must earn a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university. This
                        must include 30 semester hours in accounting (24 of which must be in upper division
                        courses) and 24 semester hours in business courses (12 of which must be in upper division
                        courses). The candidate must then pass the Uniform CPA Examination, pass an ethics
                        examination given by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
                        with a score of 90% or better, and complete one year of experience in accounting acceptable
                        to the Board.
