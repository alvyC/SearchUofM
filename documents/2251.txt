                     Please note that teaching and research assistantships, including a competitive stipend
                        and all tuition and fees, are available only for full-time students (we even pay your
                        parking!). Competition for assistantships is vigorous, and there is no guarantee that
                        all admitted students will receive financial assistance. Once an assistantship has
                        been awarded, it will continue until graduation, so long as you are making satisfactory
                        progress towards your degree.
