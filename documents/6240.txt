                     UofM Online Courses
                     
                     UofM Online degree programs are developed by University of Memphis faculty for University
                        of Memphis students. Our online courses provide flexibility and portability, so wherever
                        you can make a high speed internet connection, you can access your class and the many
                        resources available to you as a student at a major university.
                     
                     
                     Most UofM Online courses are asynchronous, so that you can "attend" class at any time.
                        However, some courses may have synchronous components that require you to be online
                        at a particular day and time, or you may be required to attend an on-campus orientation.
                        Be sure to read ALL FOOTNOTES when enrolling in online classes so you will know exactly
                              what is required .
                     
                     
                     
                     How do I register for a UofM Online course?
                     
                     The University of Memphis offers over 500 online courses which can be easily identified
                        by the section number and instructional method in the course schedule. Registration

                     I registered for an online course. What do I do now?
                     
                     If you registered for a UofM Online course, please read over the following steps to
                        get prepared for class.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Be sure your University of Memphis e-mail account is active well before the semester
                           starts. If your email account is not active, log into your myMemphis account and click on the "Initialize Your Account" link or call 901-678-8888 for
                           assistance.
                        
                        
                        UofM Online books and materials are available through the University of Memphis online bookstore. Students are responsible for having their textbooks by their first assignment. Failure
                           to obtain your book on time is not an acceptable excuse for missed assignments.
                        
                        
                        Check your memphis.edu email account at least the week before classes begin. You will likely receive important emails
                           pertinent to the start of the semester.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Where do I go to class?
                     
                     UofM Online courses (other than * TN eCampus courses ) are delivered through our eCourseware site. We strongly recommend all online students review our course software guides before the start of the semester.
                     
                     
                     When the semester starts, you may log-in directly to  your courses at eCourseware , or log-in via myMemphis and click the eCourseware link on the eCampus Student tab. 
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           
                           eCourseware ID Your eCourseware ID is the first part of your university email address. Example: If your email address is jsmith2@memphis.edu, your UUID will be jsmith2
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           eCourseware password Your password is the same as your UofM e-mail or myMemphis account password.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     If you have technical difficulties accessing your course (logging in, timing out,
                        using your course tools) call the Help Desk at 901-678-8888 or go to the Helpdesk to submit a service request.
