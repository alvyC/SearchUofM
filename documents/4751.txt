		Dear Colleagues,
Information Technology Services (ITS) is improving the quality of customer service with the development and implementation of our new Service Catalog. This catalog is designed to inform, educate and enhance your experience about the different services we offer. On the Service Catalog website, you will find hundreds of applications and services organized into 13 categories:

Accounts and Access
Classroom and Computer Lab Support
Computer, Peripherals, and Hardware
Email and Collaboration
General Questions
Network, and Wifi Connectivity
Phones, Voicemail and CATV
Research Computing
Security and Safe Computing
Servers, Storage and Data
Software and Applications
Teaching and Learning
Website Access and Support

As you browse the catalog you will find information describing each service, who may request or is eligible for the service, how to request the service and what information is needed to fulfill the request. We invite you to view the catalog at:  http://www.memphis.edu/umtech/service_catalog/index.php .
Questions regarding the service catalog may be directed to the Service Desk by calling 901.678.8888, emailing umtech@memphis.edu, or by logging into the service desk system and submitting a request at https://umhelpdesk.memphis.edu .
Regards,
