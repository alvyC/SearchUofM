                        track and an academic track, to meet each student's particular interests. Whichever
                        program you choose, we have a proven track record of placing graduates in some of
                        the best PhD programs and top corporations in the world. 
                     
                     
                     Program objectives are: (1) achievement of a solid foundation knowledge in economic
                        theory and economic analysis; (2) acquisition of an advanced level of knowledge in
                        either applied economics or academic economics; (3) acquisition of the quantitative
                        skills to effectively address research problems and the ability to make significant
                        professional contributions as a professional economist or within a functional area
                        of business; and (4) ability to compete effectively for professional positions in
                        the private or public sectors.

                        University of Memphis provides an outstanding foundation in economic theory and econometrics
                        that opens doors to the top PhD programs in the world.
                     
                     
                     If you are interested in taking your degree into the business world, the combination
                        of economic theory and analytical skills make you extremely marketable. Unlike narrower,
                        more technical master's degrees, an MA in Economics prepares students for positions
                        requiring a broad, general knowledge of the business environment.

                     PROGRAM Prerequisites
                     
                     At minimum, all students should have successfully completed at least one semester
                        of calculus and at least one semester of statistics. It is suggested that prospective
                        students also complete a second semester of calculus, courses in intermediate microeconomics
                        and macroeconomics, and a course in matrix or linear algebra.
                     
                     
                     Accelerated B.A./M.A. Program
                     
                     This program permits outstanding undergraduate Economics majors at the University
                        of Memphis to begin coursework for the Master's of Economics during their senior year.
                        Up to 9 hours of graduate coursework may count for both the undergraduate and graduate
                        degrees, allowing students to complete the M.A. degree in as little as one year beyond
                        completion of the undergraduate degree. Students interested in this accelerated program
                        are encouraged to begin planning for it early in their undergraduate careers, in consultation
                        with both their undergraduate advisor and the M.A. Coordinator of the Department of
                        Economics.
                     
                     
                     To be accepted into the Accelerated B.B.A./M.A. Program, students must have a grade
                        point average of at least 3.25, submit a copy of their transcript to the Department
                        of Economics, and receive three endorsements from department faculty members. Each
                        applicant will also complete an interview with the M.A. Coordinator of the Department.
                     
                     
                     After being accepted into the program, the student will work closely with his or her
                        undergraduate advisor and the M.A. Coordinator in order to develop a carefully tailored
                        program of study so that he or she can begin work on the M.A. as they complete the
                        B.A. Upon completion of the undergraduate degree students must apply for full admission
                        into the Graduate School and into the M.A. Program in Economics.
