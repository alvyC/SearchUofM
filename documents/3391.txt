                       ALEKS Math Assessment
                     
                     
                     To better ensure student success, the University of Memphis has adopted a mandatory
                        math assessment, known as ALEKS. The ALEKS assessment provides you with an opportunity
                        to find out what math course best fits your current knowledge and abilities. It is
                        important for success in mathematics that you enroll in a course for which you have
                        the necessary preparation and which leads to the math courses required for your particular
                        major.
                     
                     
                     All incoming students must complete the ALEKS placement assessment before attending
                        New Student Orientation in order to register for any mathematics course for the fall
                        2016 semester. Full information and testing access are available through the MyMemphis
                        portal at https://my.memphis.edu. All students must have the ALEKS math assessment
                        completed prior to their orientation sessions so the score will be available to their
                        academic advisors. Please remember your ALEKS score will determine which math course
                        you are eligible to register for at NSO. However, you may enroll in a lower level
                        math course after talking with your advisor at NSO.
