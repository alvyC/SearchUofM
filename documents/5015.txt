                     Copyright:
                     
                     No article can be published unless accompanied by a signed publication agreement,
                        which serves as a transfer of copyright from author to publisher. A publication agreement
                        will be provided on receipt of the final manuscript. Only original papers will be
                        accepted and copyright in published papers will be vested in the publisher. It is
                        the author's responsibility to obtain written permission to reproduce material that
                        has appeared in another publication.
                     
                     
                     Format of submitted material:
                     
                     All manuscripts must be submitted digitally as standard Microsoft Word document with
                        1 inch margins. All copy, including references and captions, must be typed double
                        spaced. The first page of the manuscript must bear the title of the paper and the
                        full names of the authors, as well as their affiliations and full addresses. In the
                        case of multiple authors, please indicate which author is to receive correspondence
                        and proofs. Financial support may be acknowledged in a footnote to the title. All
                        succeeding pages must bear the surname of the lead author and a page number in the
                        upper right-hand corner. The abstract submitted to the May 13th event must be included.
                     
                     
                     Style:
                     
                     In general, the style should follow the forms given in the Publication Manual of the
                        American Psychological Association (1994). The use of metric forms is required.
                     
                     
                     Organization:
                     
                     In general, the background and purpose of the study should be stated first, followed
                        by details of the methods, materials, procedures, and equipment used. Findings, discussion
                        and conclusions should follow in that order. Appendices may be employed where appropriate.
                        The APA Publication Manual should be consulted for details as needed.
                     
                     
                     Figures:
                     
                     Figures should be professionally prepared and submitted in a form suitable for reproduction
                        (camera-ready copy). Computer-generated graphs are acceptable only if they have been
                        printed with a good quality laser printer. All artwork must be identified on the back
                        in light blue pencil with the figure number, author's name and address, and a shortened
                        form of the title. Photographs should be submitted as unscreened glossy prints (20
                        x 25 cm). Two clearly legible copies must be supplied with each figure (these will
                        be sent to the referees).
                     
                     
                     Bibliography:
                     
                     The accuracy and completeness of the references is the responsibility of the author.
                        References to personal letters, paper presented at meetings, and other unpublished
                        material may be included. If such material may be of help in the evaluation of the
                        paper, copies should be made available to the Editor. Papers which are part of a series
                        should include a citation of the previous paper. Explanatory material may be appended
                        to the end of a citation to avoid footnotes in text.
                     
                     
                     The format for citations in text for bibliographic references follows the Publication
                        Manual of the American Psychological Association (1994). Citation of an author's work
                        in the text should follow the author-date method of citation; the surname of the author(s)
                        and the year of publication should appear in text. For example,
                     
                     
                     Paisley (1993) found that ...
