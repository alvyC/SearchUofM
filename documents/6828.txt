                     The use of mobile Web browsing services is a worldwide phenomenon. The intent of this
                        research is to produce a testable model of Web browsing services use that both identifies
                        unique national market differences and yet is theoretically parsimonious enough to
                        permit future cross-national studies. Specifically, our model examines which factors
                        determine the use of mobile Web browsing services in South Korea. We show that content
                        quality, hardware quality, ubiquity, cost, and relational factors are important predictors
                        of actual use of mobile Web browsing services. However, counter to our model's predictions,
                        network quality and security did not appear to be significant factors in Korea at
                        this point of market maturity. Future empirical examination of the proposed model
                        in different markets worldwide should provide multinational IT vendors with better
                        understanding of the similarities and differences in the global smart phone business.
