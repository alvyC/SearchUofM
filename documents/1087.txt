                     UofM Graduate School Relocates to the FedEx Institute of Technology
                     
                     February 15, 2016- In the modern research universities of the United States of America,
                        graduate students working under the guidance of research faculty on cutting-edge ideas
                        have become the engine for innovation, interdisciplinary discourse and research advancement
                        on campus. In recognition of this, the Graduate School of the University of Memphis
                        recently relocated to the FedEx Institute of Technology, which serves as the front
                        door and integrative hub of the University's research infrastructure and innovation
                        capabilities. The school will celebrate the move with a reception Thursday, Feb. 18,
                        at 5 p.m. in the FedEx Institute of Technology, suite 201. The move will allow the
                        University to better serve its graduate students and strengthen the link between graduate
                        education and the thriving innovation culture on campus.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Jasbir Dhaliwal, who serves both as the dean of the Graduate School and the University's
                        chief innovation officer, said, "Our environment has changed dramatically over the
                        last two decades. Today one out of every five students on campus is a graduate student
                        enrolled in a master's or doctoral program. This move celebrates this transformation
                        by ensuring that our graduate programs have a distinctive modern building as their
                        home. It also signals that graduate students and graduate education are a central
                        pillar in our ongoing development as a major metropolitan research university."            
                     
                     
                     As a major urban research university, the UofM enrolls about 4,000 (1,000 PhD and
                        3,000 master's level) graduate students in more than 118 degree programs, many of
                        which are ranked among the best in the nation. Master's degree programs are offered
                        in 54 areas through six colleges and three schools. A doctor of philosophy degree
                        is offered in 19 areas through five colleges and three schools. Also awarded are a
                        doctor of audiology, doctor of education, and doctor of musical arts degrees through
                        two colleges and one school. An education specialist degree is also offered.
                     
                     
                     The FedEx Institute of Technology serves as a catalyst for interdisciplinary research
                        innovation in emerging technology by supporting cross-campus research innovation clusters
                        in areas such as Intelligent Systems, Drones, Cybersecurity Testing, Biologistics,
                        Autonomous Vehicles, Smart Biomaterials and Precision Medicine. The Institute is also
                        home to the University's intellectual property and patent repository, which is the
                        focal point of technology transfer and licensing operations. It also strives to serve
                        as a focal point for community efforts to grow the technical sophistication of the
                        regional technology workforce and innovation environment.
