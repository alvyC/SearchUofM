                     Harassment and Discrimination
                     
                     The University of Memphis is committed to providing an environment free of harassment
                           and discrimination. This commitment furthers the University's mission of ensuring
                           that we provide a work and learning environment that is inclusive and respectful.
                     
                     HARASSMENT
                     
                     The University's anti-harassment policy prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment
                        is conduct that is based on a person's race, color, religion, creed, ethic or national
                        origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, disability, age (as applicable),
                        status as a covered veteran, genetic information, or any other category protected
                        by federal or state civil rights law that:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Adversely affects a term or condition of an individual's employment, education, participation
                           in an institution's activities or living environment;
                        
                        
                        Has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's employment

                        person similarly situated to the person complaining and in consideration of the context
                        of the behavior.
                     
                     
                     You should also know that harassment is distinguished from behavior that, even though
                        unpleasant or disconcerting, is appropriate to the carrying out of certain instructional,
                        advisory, or supervisory responsibilities.
