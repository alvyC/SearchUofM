                        scholarship of discovery and innovation across our campuses. We work to promote research
                        and creative activities by focusing on interdisciplinary scholarship, facilitating
                        partnerships, from local to international, and enabling our faculty to move the products
                        of their work from the laboratory, classroom, field and studio to the community. We
                        accomplish these goals by strategically investing our personnel and resources in efficient
                        and effective infrastructure, policies and administration.
                     
                     
                     Greetings from the Vice President
                     
                     Welcome to the offices of the Vice President of Research. Hopefully, you have just
                        read our mission statement and, like most mission statements, it promises quite a
                        lot. Here at the University of Memphis, however, having a significant impact is exactly
                        what we are attempting to do. In Memphis and throughout the Mid-South this university
                        is committed, through its student-focused educational programs, our faculty's endeavors
                        in research and creative activities, our partnerships with the corporate community,
                        local, regional and federal governments, foundations and citizens groups, to serve
                        and benefit our region, our nation and our world.
                     
                     
                     Our research development and structure includes my office, the Office of Sponsored
                        Programs, the Office of Technology Transfer, the Integrated Microscopy Center, Environmental
                        Health and Safety and the university's Animal Care operation. On our associated web
                        pages you will find a broad range of services for faculty research and the arts; from
                        our development officers supporting faculty project generation from the initial idea,
                        through the building of collaborative research teams, all the way to proposal submission
                        and project initiation and conduct. We are also responsible for faculty incentive
                        programs, seed funding for research, research policy on campus, the responsible conduct
                        of research and the broad array of compliance requirements we now face.
                     
                     
                     We engage in regular strategic planning with our faculty, department chairs, deans,
                        provost and president to make sure that our research directions are consistent with
                        our university's strengths, the priorities of our region and current national research
                        priorities. We strive to align our investments in research with those priorities.
                        Those investments also focus on the development of strong, interdisciplinary research
                        groups and the support systems that our scientists must have to succeed in today's
                        complex and competitive research environment. Finally, in our Office of Technology Transfer , we enable faculty to identify the potential commercial value of their research products,
                        and where appropriate, to bring those products to the marketplace.
