                     Founded in 1984, the Center for Applied Psychological Research is one of the original
                        Tennessee Centers of Excellence, and it is now designated an Accomplished Center of
                        Excellence. Over the twenty-three years that have elapsed since CAPR began, CAPR has
                        far exceeded all benchmarks set for its performance. CAPR faculty have attracted millions
                        of dollars in extramural funding to the State of Tennessee, published hundreds of
                        scholarly works, graduated hundreds of masters and doctoral students and many times
                        that number of undergraduates, been elected or appointed to many national professional
                        offices, and won numerous local and national honors and awards. By any standard CAPR
                        is one of the most successful centers ever funded under the State of Tennessee's Centers
                        of Excellence program.
                     
                     
                     CAPR Mission Statement
                     
                     The faculty members in CAPR apply scientific methods and knowledge of psychology to
                        the solution of problems in individuals, communities, and society. The faculty advance
                        scientific research and theory in addition to solving practical problems. CAPR is
                        one of the original Tennessee Centers of Excellence that was established in 1984.
                        CAPR is now designated an Accomplished Center of Excellence, in recognition of the
                        Center's consistently high quality of research, teaching, and service over the years.
                        During the last decade, faculty in the CAPR have brought in and expended over $30
                        million in external funding, published over 1500 scholarly works, and graduated hundreds
                        of masters and doctoral students. For every $1 invested in CAPR by the State of Tennessee,
                        the faculty currently bring in another $5.50 as PI's on external grants. The 33 faculty
                        in CAPR cover six areas of specialization: (1) behavioral medicine and community psychology,
                        (2) neuropsychology and behavioral neuroscience, (3) child and family studies, (4)
                        cognitive and social processes, (5) psychotherapy and psychopathology, and (6) industrial
                        and organizational psychology. In order to convey the scope of CAPR more concretely,
                        some research projects that are currently funded by external grants are presented
                        in the subsequent pages.
                     
                     
                     CAPR Goals and Objectives
                     
                     Since its inception, the three primary goals of the CAPR have always been (a) to achieve
                        national prominence for its accomplishments, (b) to increase the number of trained
                        psychologists able to conduct, disseminate, and apply such research, and (c) to secure
                        extramural funding to facilitate research and training. In addition, as part of a
                        Psychology Department in a major urban research university, CAPR supports the general
                        teaching, research, and service missions of the department and university.
                     
                     
                     CAPR Service Profile
                     
                     In addition, CAPR faculty share their knowledge and expertise with the city and state
                        in numerous other ways. For example, during the last several years, the CAPR faculty
                        included (a) a member of the Task Force on Autism of the State of Tennessee Department
                        of Mental Health and Mental Retardation; (b) a research consultant to Leadership Memphis;
                        (c) President of the Advisory Board of Project R.A.P. (Responsible Adolescent Parenting),
                        a local project to prevent teen pregnancies; (d) a member of a state committee to
                        develop standards of practice guidelines and legislative actions on the issue of sexual
                        misconduct by mental health professionals; (e) a member of the Shelby County Environmental
                        Improvement Commission; (f) consultants to the Environmental Court (General Sessions,
                        Division 14, Judge Potter) to improve the flow of cases through the court; (g) consultants
                        to several state agencies to improve highway safety; (h) consultants to a survey to
                        identify the best location of the Internal Revenue Service Center in Memphis; and
                        (i) the co-host of a weekly television news piece to improve health called "Ask the
                        Prevention Center". CAPR faculty provide most of these services at no charge to the
                        recipients.
                     
                     
                     CAPR Conclusion
                     
                     The CAPR has been an excellent investment for the citizens of Tennessee, in terms
                        of research and teaching productivity, in terms of attracting external grant dollars,
                        and in terms of having an impact on the real problems of our community and state.
                        But as we enter our second decade of CAPR funding, we are already considering how
                        we can improve on that first decade's performance. Self-evaluation is a regular part
                        of our work; and every few years we bring in outside experts to give us critical feedback
                        about how we can improve. In 1995 CAPR conducted one such review by bringing in our
                        Board of Visitors for their advice, and as a result CAPR has initiated a major review
                        of CAPR organization. One goal is to streamline our organizational structure to make
                        it smaller, more efficient, and a better training experience for undergraduate and
                        graduate students. Another goal is to ensure that CAPR dollars are being spent where
                        they will produce the most return on the investment—in the specialty areas and faculty
                        that have produced high quality basic or applied research, and on activities that
                        contribute directly and demonstrably to our mission.
