                     Ceruti String Quartet
                     
                     Since its inception in 1994, the Ceruti Quartet has brought chamber music to audiences
                        of all ages in performances described variously as "spirited, richly colorful, and
                        incisive" and "intimately poetic."  They have presented recitals in such venues as
                        Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall; the Goethe Institut in New York City; the National
                        Assembly in Seoul, Korea; the Ford Center, MS; the Peace Center for the Arts, SC;
                        and the Teatro Santa Isabel in Recife, Brazil. They have been featured artists for
                        the Memphis Chamber Music Society; the Bechstein Hall Concert Series, AK; and both
                        the Fine Arts Center and the Governor's School for the Arts, SC.  In addition to its
                        formal concerts, the Quartet has been dedicated to fostering chamber music in the
                        next generation of audiences and musicians through teaching/performing residencies
                        in Tennessee, South Carolina, Michigan, Georgia, and New York.
                     
                     
                     The members of the Ceruti Quartet are members of the string faculty at the Rudi E.
                        Scheidt School of Music at the University of Memphis, where they also direct the string
                        chamber music program: Marcin Arendt and Timothy Shiu, violins; Lenny Schranze, viola;
                        and Kimberly Patterson, cello.  Quartet members have served on the faculties of summer

                        Interlochen Center for the Arts.
