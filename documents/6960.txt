                     Application to Graduate School
                     
                     Prerequisites for admission to graduate programs in Chemistry include:
                     
                     
                        
                        Satisfactory record of undergraduate coursework in chemistry
                        
                        GRE general examination* test scores (or departmental waiver**)

                     * GRE subject exam is not required ** Departmental waivers for GRE scores are rarely granted
                     
                     
                     Teaching and research assistantships, including a competitive stipend and all tuition
                        and fees, are available only for full-time students (we even pay your parking!). Competition
                        for assistantships is vigorous, and there is no guarantee that all admitted students
                        will receive financial assistance. Once an assistantship has been awarded, it will
                        continue until graduation, so long as you are making satisfactory progress towards
                        your degree.

                              application to the graduate school is complete. Also, note that assistantships can not be approved until you are fully admitted to
                        the Graduate School.
