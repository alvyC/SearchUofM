                     ON-CAMPUS RECRUITING
                     
                     Each fall and spring, we welcome employers to campus as part of our On-Campus Interview
                        (OCI) Program. As a participant in the OCI Program, you will have an opportunity to
                        interview students for summer and post-graduation positions. If you do not wish to
                        interview on campus, you may utilize our Resume Collection Program.

                           (i.e. patent practice requires science/engineering degree).
                        
                        
                        Click "Submit."
