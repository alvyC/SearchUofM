                        Dr. Ralph Faudree (August 23, 1939 – January 13, 2015)
                        
                        
                        It is difficult to overstate the multi-fold, deep, even transformational impact 
                           that Dr. Ralph Faudree has had on the University of Memphis over the past 44 
                           years of his service: as a world-class  research mathematician in the area 
                           of graph theory since he joined Memphis in 1971; as Chair of the Department 
                           of Mathematical Sciences (1983-1994); as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences
                           
                           (1995-2000); as University Provost (2001-2012), as Interim-President (2000-2001).
                        
                        
                        
                        Dr. Ralph Faudree passed away on January 13, 2015, leaving an unfillable void.
                           The University of Memphis has paid tribute to Dr. Faudree's service with an announcement
                           
                           on January 14, 2015 to all Faculty Staff and Students by Interim Provost Karen D Weddle-West
                           and 
                           President M. Davis Rudd. A University-wide Memorial Service was held on January 17,
                           2015.
                        
                        
                        
                        The present obituary is written with focus on Dr. Faudree as a long-time 
                           member of, and contributor to, the Department of Mathematical Sciences. 
                           In short: it was Dr. Faudree who took a teaching-oriented department in the early
                           70s 
                           and by virtue of the sheer energy and charisma of his own example as a well-rounded
                           international scholar 
                           and a far-reaching vision of the true values of academia, he managed to transform
                           it into a mathematically 
                           research-oriented department, with areas of excellence, and a 100% 
                           research-active faculty, while simultaneously nurturing, expanding, and enhancing
                           the educational mission 
                           of the department.This is the legacy that Ralph Faudree leaves to the DMS and the
                           University of Memphis, 
                           to counter his irreplaceable loss. As explicitly noted in the official 
                           University of Memphis announcement of January 14, this he achieved through an aggressive recruitment and 
                              retention of high-quality faculty; development and implementation of rigorous research
                              standards; 
                              development of a comprehensive and demanding tenure and promotion methodology; administration
                              of a 
                              meaningful faculty evaluation process .
                         
                        
                        
                        Dr. Faudree received his Master and PhD from Purdue University in 1963 and 1964 respectively.
                           
                           He then taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Illinois,
                           before joining the University of Memphis in 1971. 
                           Throughout his academic career, Dr. Faudree maintained an active and prolific research
                           program in the areas of 
                           graphical Ramsey theory and Hamiltonian theory of graphs. He has to his credit over
                           250 research papers, 
                           13 published in 2013-2014 and 7 submitted in 2014, 
                           a testimonial of his dedication and commitment to the profession and the department.
                        
                        
                        
                        He enjoyed an international 
                           reputation and served as a Visiting Professor at numerous universities world-wide:
                           The University of Twente in the Netherlands, 
                           the University of Aberdeen in Scotland; the University of Paris; the University of
                           Singapore; and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 
                           to name a few. It is at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences that Dr. Faudree cemented
                           his relationship with Dr. Paul Erdős, one 
                           of the 20th century's most prolific and respected mathematicians. Their collaboration
                           led to more than 45 joint articles in graph theory. 
                           Since Dr. Erdős' death, Dr. Faudree continued the work they had begun together, collaborating
                           with mathematicians in both Hungary and 
                           the United States. He also helped to perpetuate Dr. Erdős' work by co-sponsoring the
                           Erdős lecture series at the University of Memphis and 
                           by establishing the Erdős Professorship in the DMS. In recognition of their support
                           and regard for Dr. Faudree, Mr. amd Mrs. Jabie Hardin 
                           endowed the Faudree University Professorship at the University of Memphis. Only in
                           the last two years, Dr. Faudree has given 6 invited talks and 2 plenary talks at international
                           conferences, the last one at 
                           the VII Conference in Graph Theory held in Krakow, Poland, in September 2014. He was a co-recipient of the University's
                           Distinguished 
                           Research Award in 1978; the Superior Performance in Research Award in 1986, 1988-90
                           and 1992-93; the College of Arts and Science 
                           Meritorious Faculty Award in 1991; and the Board of Visitors' Eminent Faculty Award
                           in 1994. In 2005 he received the Euler Medal
                           by the Institute of Combinatorics. Since 2012, he held the First Tennessee Professorship.
                        
                        
                        
                        After returning to the Department of Mathematical Sciences in August 2012,
                           following his 11-year term as Provost, Dr. Faudree's highly respected, charismatic,
                           fair, iconic figure 
                           was instrumental in the continued success of the department: as a member of the Advisory
                           Committee and the Director of Graduate Studies. 
                           He was also most generous with his time, with both students and faculty alike. The
                           DMS has received numerous correspondence from former undergraduate and graduate students
                           who remember him fondly and grieve his premature departure.
                        
                        
                        
                        His passing leaves a human and professional vacuum for all of us.
