                     Mathematics plays an ever increasingly critical role in our global society, which
                        requires analytical and quantitative analysis. In the present job market, job opportunities
                        and careers are increasingly driven by mathematical thinking and quantitative skills.
                        The DMS offers various degree programs at the B.S. , M.S., and Ph.D. level. Our graduate programs are characterized by breadth and depth in the following
                        areas: combinatorics and graph theory ; ergodic theory ; functional analysis and operator theory ; functional and partial differential equations and applied mathematics ; mathematical learning theory and operations research ; and applied statistics .
                     
                     
                     The DMS' faculty is actively involved in: (1) cutting-edge research in the above areas;
                        (2) effective and dedicated education of the student population in small size sections;
                        (3) close mentoring of Ph.D. students, domestic and international, aimed at preparing
                        them for successful professional careers, both in academia and in the private or governmental
                        sector; (4) service to the professional community and organizations through direct
                        participation in scientific committees, editorial boards of math journals or book-series,
                        and scientific panels. The DMS faculty is highly research productive in scholarly
                        work, with several research projects being supported by external grants from the NSF,
                        AFOSR, DARPA, etc.. The DMS organizes annually a number of conferences: the Erdős
                        Conference in honor of Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős who was a frequent annual visitor of the department; and the Differential Equation
                        Weekend. Both are sponsored by the NSF. The DMS is scheduled to host the 34th South
                        East Atlantic Conference in Differential Equations in October 2014; and a regional
                        meeting of the American Mathematical Society in October 2015. The DMS has hosted other
                        major International Conferences in Analysis, PDEs, and Statistics.
