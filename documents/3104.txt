                     I know no other way to explain my internship experience except memorable. This semester
                        I learned the true value of a green internship. I was very pleased to have worked
                        alongside Dr. Simco, Dr. Goudie, and the volunteer David.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Simco taught me many things about water aquatics, and showed me how USDA grade
                        catfish are raised.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Goudie helped me enhance my experience with excel. While teaching me the true
                        value of our environment all the way down to the trees and birds that we see on a
                        daily basis.
                     
                     
                     David and I were able to get all the bird feeders, blue bird houses and martin house
                        setup and installed around the circle drive on South Campus. Time seemed to fly by
                        as I learn new and exciting things. I would recommend this site for any future green
                        intern, due to the fact that they welcomed me with open arms, and I gained so much
                        knowledge about saving our environment

                     Classification : Senior Internship site : Jabberblabber Earth Friendly Family Magazine While interning at Jabberblabber Earth Friendly Family Magazine, I have to say my
                        most memorable moment was going out to the community and helping with events. I loved
                        getting out and being effective and helpful in the community.

                     Classification : Senior Internship site : Ground Water Institute The most valuable thing that I will take away from my internship is the amount of
                        confidence that this opportunity has given me. I will end this year and a half long
                        experience with the knowledge and the wherewithal to enter into the job market as
                        a more capable, confident, and knowledgeable geologist. I am so grateful to GWI and
                        the internship office for allowing me this experience

                     As a mechanical engineering student, it is very important to build a professional
                        network for potentially future internships or full time positions. By working with
                        the Industrial Assessment Center, I've had the opportunity to network during each
                        Industrial Assessment project and event. Learning different processes from different
                        plant managers and engineering staff on different facilities has given me a better
                        understating on what to expect as a mechanical engineer.

                     Classification: Junior Internship Site: Student Health Center. My most memorable moments were my tabling events in the University Center.  I prepared
                        a table on topics such as Birth Control, Spring Break Safety, and Skin Safety. What
                        I enjoyed most was being able to teach people about the risk factors, prevention,
                        and multiple facts associated with each topic. I also enjoyed having to be creative
                        and coming up with designs that would draw people in to want to learn about my topic.
