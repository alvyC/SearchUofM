                     The University desires to assist and support nursing mothers who have a need for lactation
                        space.  The University is also committed to working with students and employees to
                        provide a safe, clean, private space for lactating mothers and working with employees
                        to provide reasonable amounts of break time, as needed, for up to one year following
                        the birth of their child.  Individuals desiring on-campus space for purposes of lactation/expressing
                        milk may request assistance as follows:

                     The first milk, colostrum, is very rich in nutrients and antibodies, and as your baby
                        grows your breast milk adapts to meet his/her needs. Breast milk is also easier for
                        your baby to digest.
                     
                     
                     Breast milk supplies cells, hormones, and antibodies which protect your baby from
                        illnesses like ear infections, diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, atopic dermatitis,
                        asthma, obesity, types I and II diabetes, and childhood leukemia. It has also been
                        shown to lower the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
