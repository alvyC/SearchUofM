                     The Department of Chemistry offers courses leading to the B.S. degree with a major
                        in chemistry. The department also offers a program culminating in the professional
                        degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry (B.S.Ch.). This program is designed to
                        meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical
                        Society, and is undertaken primarily by students who desire to go directly to positions
                        in the chemical industry, or to enroll for postgraduate study in chemistry.
                     
                     
                     SEQUENCE OF COURSES
                     
                     Students who have a score on the university's math placement exam (ALEKS) earning
                        placement into MATH 1720 or higher should enroll in CHEM 1110 /1111 if they plan to
                        take more than one year of college chemistry, or plan to major in either a natural
                        science or in biomedical, civil, mechanical, or electrical engineering. CHEM 1010/1011
                        and 1020/1021 are for students interested in the science of chemistry, but are not
                        credited toward a major in chemistry, biology or physics. CHEM 1010/1011 and 1020/1021
                        may satisfy the General Education Natural Science requirements of other majors. CHEM
                        1010 may be taken as preparation by students of limited high school chemistry background
                        whose curriculum requires CHEM 1110.
                     
                     
                     ADVANCED PLACEMENT
                     
                     Beginning students who have had previous high school training in chemistry are invited
                        to apply for advanced placement.
                     
                     
                     LABORATORY SAFETY AND COURSE REQUIREMENTS
                     
                     Laboratory safety is strictly practiced in the Department of Chemistry. Approved eye
                        protection must be worn as required in all chemical laboratories. In addition, to
                        ensure that students enrolled in laboratory courses learn the necessary safety information
                        to safely participate in the laboratory course, all prerequisites and/or corequisites
                        for all laboratory courses are strictly enforced. As a result, when a student enrolls
                        in a laboratory course without prior completion of the necessary prerequisite or corequisite,
                        the student will be dropped from the laboratory course. In addition, when a student
                        simultaneously enrolls in a laboratory course and corequisite course, but subsequently
                        drops or discontinues the corequisite course, the student will be dropped from the
                        laboratory course. In the event any student fails to comply with any safety requirements
                        of the Department of Chemistry, the department has the right to not allow the student
                        to perform laboratory work, or to withdraw the student from the laboratory course,
                        as appropriate.
                     
                     
                     The requirements listed below are for majors and minors for the Bachelor of Science
                        degrees or for minors for the Bachelor of Arts degrees; for detailed requirements
                        for the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, a professional degree, see degree requirements
                        described later in this section.
