                     The Level I and II Health Care Interpreter Training Courses, administered by School
                        of Public Health, are part of a specialized educational program for individuals who
                        are proficient in two or more languages; it is the first program in the US to be accredited
                        by the International Medical Interpreter Association (IMIA).
                     
                     
                     The Level I course is a 60-hour classroom experience, offered over four consecutive
                        weekends, combined with a minimum ten (10) hour practicum at one of our affiliated
                        sites: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Methodist hospitals and clinics, and
                        Le Bonheur Children's Hospital and Compassion Clinic.  In Level I, students learn
                        the basics of medical interpreting, including roles, modes, protocols, standards and
                        codes of ethics, medical terminology, basic anatomy and physiology, cultural competence,
                        and other topics relevant to the profession.  Please click here to review the Level I Course Handbook.
                     
                     
                     The Level II course is a continuation of Level I, and is usually offered in the Spring
                        semester.  This advanced course is offered to students who successfully complete Level
                        I, and covers topics including interpreting in the emergency department, ICU, oncology
                        and palliative care, and additional anatomy, physiology, and medical terminology.
                     
                     
                     Both Level I and Level II are intensive courses, and a minimum of 10 students must
                        enroll for the courses to be held as scheduled.

                        of and improve the knowledge and skills of medical interpreters nationwide.  The courses are
