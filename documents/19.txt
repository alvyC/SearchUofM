                     Gov. Haslam Announces Governing Board for University of Memphis
                     
                     October 12, 2016 - Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced the eight appointees
                        to the newly created University of Memphis governing board, giving the University
                        increased autonomy to support student success as the state continues its Drive to
                        55 initiative.
                     
                     
                     "This is a landmark day for the University of Memphis, our city and West Tennessee,"
                        said UofM President M. David Rudd. "The appointment of our new Board of Trustees and
                        related change in our governance structure will better position the UofM to grow and
                        compete at the national level, with an unparalleled commitment to innovation, efficiency
                        and effectiveness. I would like to thank our new Trustees for their willingness to
                        serve our University and broader Memphis community. We aspire to join the top tier
                        of research universities nationally and look forward to working with this very talented
                        group to realize that goal.
                     
                     
                     "We are grateful for Governor Haslam's vision for the future of higher education in
                        Tennessee and the support of our state legislators. Without their commitment to excellence
                        in higher education, this remarkable opportunity would not be possible."
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis Board of Trustees is one of six to be appointed by Gov.
                        Haslam, a result of his FOCUS Act passed by the General Assembly earlier this year.
