                     Increases in employee autonomy and the formation of teams often result from reengineering
                     and process innovation efforts, as do moves to "downsize" or "flatten" organizations.
                     Information systems departments have not been insulated from these trends. In spite
                     of the rising interest in these initiatives, little is known about their impact on
                     the systems development process. Past research in blue-collar contexts suggests that
                     teams produce improvements in performance, while anecdotal evidence in the IS industry
                     suggests that such improvements may never materialize. This paper reports on research
                     conducted with 231 IS professionals from 27 systems development teams across 13 organizations.
                     The results indicate that, while autonomy may lead to increased levels of satisfaction
                     and motivation, the level of team development and an organization's learning capacity
                     may be more important in achieving improved work outcomes.
