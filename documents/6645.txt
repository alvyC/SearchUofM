                        About Dr. Liu
                        
                        I am trained in the general areas of biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics,
                           and I have become very interested in physiology in recent years. I teach Biochemistry
                           ii (upper undergraduate and graduate level) and Biological Clocks (graduate level,
                           team with Dr. David Freeman ). The major focus of my lab is the biochemical and molecular basis of circadian rhythms
                           in physiology and behavior. We use mice and rats and cultured mammalian cells as model
                           systems and employ highly integrated approaches in our experiments. I have always
                           been fascinated by the prevalence of the circadian phenomenon and the multi-dimensional
                           organization of the system. Leveraging our expertise and various cell and animal clock
                           models, my lab carries out three main areas of research: i) probe the biochemical
                           and structural basis of circadian behavior; ii) identify novel genes and networks
                           that modulate clock function; and iii) investigate the physiology of blood pressure
                           regulation and pathophysiology of hypertension, centering on circadian rhythms of
                           blood pressure, asleep hypertension and chronotherapeutics. We study the circadian
                           system at multiple levels of biological organization (i.e., cell, tissue, organ, and
                           organism). Scientifically, our goal is to fill in the gaps in knowledge about the
                           molecular and cellular processes connecting genes to behavior, and to elucidate how
                           the molecular clocks regulate behavior, physiology, and metabolism. Ultimately, I
                           hope to gather sufficiently detailed knowledge to effectively modulate our timekeeping
                           system to improve treatments for clock-related disorders and enhance body fitness.
