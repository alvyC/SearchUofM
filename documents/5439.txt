                     VA Will Not Pay All Tuition
                     
                     Federal regulations have changed the amount of tuition and fee charges that schools
                        can report to the VA for Chapter 33-Post 9/11 GI Bill Recipients. For periods of enrollment
                        beginning on or after August 1, 2011, schools are to report actual net cost for in-state
                        tuition and fees assessed by the institution, after deducting funds or assistance
                        provided directly to the institution and designated for the sole purpose of defraying
                        tuition and fees.
                     
                     
                     Examples of funds or aid that will be deducted when reporting tuition and fees include:

                        Federal or state tuition assistance (ex.: Federal TA through the Reserves or National

                        Title IV Funds (ex.: Pell Grants or loans) WILL NOT be deducted.
                        
                        Any scholarship or other aid that is not designated specifically for the sole purpose
                           of defraying tuition and fees WILL NOT be deducted.

                     In Example 1 above, the student has a $1,000 scholarship from a local organization.
                        The scholarship is general in nature and may be used to defray school costs such as
                        food, housing, books, etc. Since it is not "specifically designated for the sole purpose
                        of defraying tuition and fees," it is not deducted from the charges submitted to VA.

                     In Example 2 above, the student is eligible for Chapter 33-Post 9/11 benefits at the
                        80% level. Since the University Scholarship of $3640.00 is specifically designated
                        for tuition and fees, it must be deducted from the gross in-state tuition and fees,
                        thus leaving a balance of $421.00. The VA will pay $336.80 (80% $421.00) to the school
                        on behalf of the student. The remaining balance of $84.20 becomes the student's responsibility.
                        VA does the calculation when it comes to the service tier percentage. The schools
                        is responsible for reporting actual NET charged in-state tuition and fees.
                     
                     
                     VA Will Not Pay All Fees
                     
                     The VA has determined that not all student fees are payable under Chapter 33:

                        These fees are deducted from the amount certified to the VA and become the student's
                           responsibility.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     UniversityÂ Charges Due to Drop(s) or Withdrawal Become the Student's Responsibility
                     
                     Any student who drops or withdraws on or after the first day of the term will be charged a percentage of the tuition and fees assessed
                        by the University. The student will be responsible for these charges.
                     
                     
                     If a student withdraws from all classes before or on the first day of the term, the school must refund the VA all tuition and fees received
                        from the VA for the term.
                     
                     
                     University of Memphis Enrollment Certification Procedure
                     
                     VA Enrollment Certifications are being submitted early, prior to knowing all monies
                        which must be deducted, so that veterans may receive their book stipend and their
                        BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing). A second enrollment certification will then be
                        submitted as needed after the term begins and the monies which must be deducted are
                        known. This allows time for the Bursar's Office to apply any waiver, scholarship,
                        aid, or any other assistance provided directly to the school and specifically designated
                        for the sole purposeÂ  of defraying tuition and fees in an effort to reduce overpayments
                        to the school and/or to the student.
