                     University of Memphis Uses New Tech Tool to Help Students Choose Courses and Majors
                     
                     For release: February 14, 2012
                     
                     For press information, contact Curt Guenther, 901-678-2843 901-678-2843
                     
                     College students use tech tools for everything from ordering pizza to playing games.
                        The same technology software will soon be used to help University of Memphis students
                        decide which courses will help them graduate faster, which courses will result in
                        better grades, and even what subject to choose for a major.
                     
                     
                     The technology, originally developed by Austin Peay State University Provost Tristan
                        Denley, uses data to identify the course requirements for a student's major, then
                        to find the classes in which the student is most likely to perform well. The tool
                        scans the university's records to compare the success of similar students taking similar
                        classes – much like online shopping programs recommend products purchased by other
                        customers.
                     
                     
                     "It helps them make better, more informed choices by using something they're already
                        familiar with, such as a smart phone or mobile device app," said Denley. While it
                        doesn't replace traditional faculty advising, it makes the advising process easier
                        and faster for students and faculty.
                     
                     
                     Proven effective at Austin Peay, the same technology will soon be in use at the University
                        of Memphis and two other Tennessee Board of Regents campuses – Nashville State Community
                        College and Volunteer State Community College – thanks to a grant to the Tennessee
                        Higher Education Commission from Complete College America, in collaboration with the
                        Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Shannon Blanton, vice provost for Undergraduate Programs at the UofM, said, "We
                        are very excited about the opportunity to incorporate additional tools into our advising
                        processes and further enhance the ability of our students to make informed choices
                        about the classes they take and the major they select. Students have different academic
                        strengths and interests that translate into different patterns of academic success.
                        The student who excels in his or her journalism class, for example, might have a different
                        set of academic competencies and interests than the student who is highly successful
                        in a chemistry course. This technology will help students to identify the academic
                        areas in which they are most likely to excel and find personal satisfaction. In turn,
                        we expect that these students will be more likely to complete their degrees."
                     
                     
                     A portion of the $1 million grant has allowed the software to be adapted for use at
                        the University of Memphis andthe other colleges and to be tested for possible use
                        state-wide.
                     
                     
                     "We know that the more time it takes students to earn a degree, the less likely they
                        are to successfully complete college," said TBR Chancellor John Morgan. "Of all the
                        challenges facing students on a regular basis, knowing which courses to take and when
                        to take them should not be one of those challenges. This tool will make it easier
                        for students to plan their course loads and will help improve the advising process."
                     
                     
                     The program, called "Degree Compass," uses predictive analytics through a complex
                        algorithm that pulls data and statistics from the university's student database. Denley
                        said that after it accurately predicted a student's performance to within half a letter
                        grade., it was quickly adopted for use at Austin Peay.
                     
                     
                     Now Denley and his colleagues are working on a feature to help students choose a major
                        – or find one that better fits their past performance and one that has proven to be
                        a positive choice for other students with similar grades and characteristics.
                     
                     
                     The new software will be closely tracked to evaluate the impact it has on student
                        performance. According to TBR's Morgan, the goal is to radically improve student advising
                        and ultimately, college completion rates.
