                     Dear Campus Community:
                     
                     The University of Memphis is dedicated to helping students, faculty and staff create
                        a vibrant, welcoming, inclusive and safe environment. As you may be aware, there was
                        an incident last week in which a student found her car vandalized and a racist note
                        was left on her windshield. We immediately reached out to the student involved, along
                        with her family. The incident has been vigorously investigated, but we have been unable
                        to identify the perpetrator. We will continue to investigate the incident and will
                        respond accordingly. Racism, bigotry and hate speech, in any form or fashion, will
                        not be tolerated on our campus.
                     
                     
                     This is an important moment in our nation's history. Issues of race, free speech and
                        social justice have been at the forefront. We were proud of our campus' response to
                        two visitors espousing controversial ideas and opinions a few weeks ago. There is
                        a difference, though, between free speech and hate speech meant to demean and humiliate.
                        As was noted in a communication last year, at the heart of our mission is a commitment
                        to providing a high-quality comprehensive education for our students, and doing so
                        in a safe environment but also an environment that challenges our students to explore
                        a diverse range of ideas and beliefs, and to grow and develop as individuals. An exceptional
                        educational experience is one that challenges ideas and encourages creativity, not
                        one that insulates students from the diversity that is our city and nation. Diversity
                        enriches all of our lives. Universities are about ideas, some of which will push traditional
                        boundaries and challenge the status quo. A vibrant university community embraces this
                        reality. It does not seek to silence debate and discussion; rather, it encourages
                        and nurtures it. Similarly though, a vibrant university community does not tolerate
                        racism, bigotry and hate speech meant to demean, humiliate and degrade. This most
                        recent incident was intended to do just that. We will respond to incidents like the
                        one last week in quick and decisive fashion, recognizing that we need to investigate
                        and fully understand the situation first.
                     
                     
                     The last few weeks have raised important issues for our campus. One incident was clear
                        in its intent and purpose, the other more nuanced and complex. Consistent with our
                        mission, our next Critical Conversation campus-wide discussion will address this very
                        issue, and we invite you to participate - details about this Critical Conversation
                        event will follow. We also have a University Town Hall meeting scheduled for next
                        week, Thursday, October 13 at 3:00 p.m. in the University Center Theatre. Please join
                        us.
                     
                     
                     We will always strive to create a vibrant and safe environment for our entire campus
                        community. Sometimes the issues raised will be clear, sometimes more subtle, provocative
                        and difficult. As an engaged community, we will always be up to the challenge.
                     
                     
                     Warm Regards,
