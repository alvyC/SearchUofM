                     A city students remember for a lifetime.
                     
                     Your passion for new ideas will never end, but we know where it begins. In Memphis.
                        Our university is proud to be situated in a residential neighborhood inside one of
                        the most loved cities in America. We feel lucky to be in a town where innovation has
                        been alive and well for hundreds of years. Elvis birthed rock 'n' roll here. W. C.
                        Handy birthed the blues in downtown Memphis, and B. B. King found his groove on Beale
                        Street, too. It just doesn't get more authentic than that. There is a creative, funky
                        vibe in this city that people travel from all over the world to feel.
                     
                     
                     As a student at Herff, you'll get to soak up all things innovative and interesting
                        about Memphis.
                     
                     
                     An education you'll treasure forever.
                     
                     People like you come to Memphis to attend Herff's program because it's transformative.
                        It will totally elevate the way you think and the way you live. All the finest engineering
                        programs want all the finest students. You are in high demand, so you have a right
                        to be picky. What you'll discover when you look at Herff is something compelling:
                        size matters. We don't believe in the mega-huge engineering approach. Our intimate
                        program gives you the kind of collaboration that leads to amazing work. Smaller class
                        sizes mean you will collaborate on a daily basis with big-time engineers, professors,
                        scholars and mentors. You won't have to nudge your way up to the front of a crowded
                        classroom to get the professor's attention. You will get to know the faculty on a
                        personal level. Rub elbows with them in research. They will know your name.
                     
                     
                     No matter where you come from, our friendly campus atmosphere makes everyone feel
                        at home. And we are regularly ranked the safest public university in Tennessee, thanks
                        to innovative practices and 24/7 security patrol.
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     Engineering Scholarships
                     
                     When financial barriers prevent a talented individual from expanding or completing
                        his or her education, it is a loss for society. At the Herff College of Engineering,
                        we measure our success in the differences we make in students' lives. Thanks to the
                        Dean's vision and generous donors, we are able to offer scholarships to incoming engineering
                        students. To read the requirements and apply for an engineering scholarship, visit here
