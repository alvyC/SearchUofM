                     How to find us
                     
                     The departmental office is in 219 Mitchell Hall, 3705 Alumni Drive. Mitchell Hall
                        is just to the south of the Administration Building and across the Alumni Mall from
                        the University Center, grid E/F-11 on the  online campus map .
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Mitchell Hall, home of the Department of History
                     
                     If you are not familiar with the campus, a  Google Earth image  will show the location of Mitchell Hall at the tip of the green arrow, with enough
                        of the surrounding area to place it in a recognizable context.
                     
                     
                     To get a closer and more helpful view you should adjust the zoom control one step
                        at a time to give whatever degree of detail you desire. As with all Google Earth images,
                        you may change the view to hide or show labels such as street or building names, change
                        to a map instead of an aerial photograph, print the image, or e-mail a link to the
                        map to yourself or others.
                     
                     
                     As an alternative, you may get an  aerial photograph from Google Earth  that shows Mitchell Hall and its surrounding area already at a fairly detailed zoom
                        level. Mitchell Hall will be shown at the tip of the green arrow, as before. You may
                        change this view in the same ways as described above.
                     
                     
                     If you are using GPS to locate Mitchell Hall, the coordinates are 35.117848, -89.938654
