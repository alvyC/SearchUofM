                     The interdisciplinary Emergency Management concentration is designed for students
                        with a diversity of backgrounds and interest in applying that background to emergency
                        management, community resilience to disaster, environmental hazards mitigation, emergency
                        management response, and business continuity/disaster recovery. It will address the
                        following critical knowledge elements: a) the physical and social dimensions of disasters
                        through combining knowledge from various physical, social, and applied disciplines,
                        b) the intersection of public policy to disaster risk, response, and mitigation, c)
                        the intersection of the private, nonprofit, and governmental sectors and how this
                        effects emergency preparedness, mitigation, and recovery, d) sustainable development,
                        planning for and response to extreme events and change in our physical and human landscapes;
                        and e) communication dynamics and persuasive communication in emergencies.
