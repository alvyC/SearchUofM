                     Dear Campus Community:
                     
                     As mentioned in last week's first general faculty meeting, the University of Memphis
                        is supporting a TIF application (Tax Increment Financing) from the University Neighborhood
                        Development Corporation (UNDC). A public presentation was made today to the Shelby
                        County Commissioners Economic Development Committee. We will be presenting to the
                        Memphis City Council in the coming weeks.
                     
                     
                     As you can see from the presentation slides that are attached , the purpose of the TIF is to "improve the area surrounding the University of Memphis
                        and promote student safety, walkability and to fully engage students in community
                        life and retain talent in Memphis". Also as detailed, the TIF will provide for over
                        $21 million to be invested over the next twenty years, all supporting the University
                        District neighborhood.
                     
                     
                     This is an extremely important and wonderful step for the University of Memphis and
                        the UNDC. Given these presentations and related discussion are public, I wanted to
                        make sure you had accurate details. We will keep you updated as we move through the
                        approval process.
                     
                     
                     Warm Regards,
