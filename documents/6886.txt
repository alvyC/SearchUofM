                     Computer users face a new and growing threat to security and privacy. This threat
                     is not in the form of direct attacks by viruses or hackers, but rather by indirect
                     infiltration in the form of monitoring programs surreptitiously installed on computers.
                     These monitoring applications are called spyware, and serve to record and transmit
                     a user's computer uses and behaviors to third parties. Frequently used by marketers
                     to harvest customer data for segmentation and targeting purposes, spyware can serve
                     to direct targeted advertising to user's computers. Spyware is often legally used
                     since installations can be authorized as part of the licensed "clickwrap" agreement
                     that users agree to when downloading free utility and file sharing programs from the
                     Internet. In some cases, spyware is installed as part of legitimate computer applications
                     provided by business to their customers, to provide updating and communicative functionality
                     to application users. It appears that the ability to monitor remotely and communicate
                     with computers is an opportunity attractive enough to attract the attention of third
                     parties with non-legal intentions. This article focuses on the roles and functions
                     of spyware, its use in both legitimate and non-legitimate ways, and a range of preventions
                     and protections for avoiding and removing spyware that has been installed on end user
                     computers.
