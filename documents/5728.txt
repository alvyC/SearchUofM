                     To become enrolled in School of Music degree programs, all prospective students must
                        apply and be accepted by both the School of Music (SOM) and by the University of Memphis
                        (UofM).  Acceptance by the SOM is contingent upon UofM acceptance. Seek enrollment
                        in the UofM by contacting the Undergraduate Office of Admissions at 901.678.2111,  admissions@memphis.edu .
                     
                     
                     Applicants seeking SOM scholarships should be accepted by the UofM before their audition
                        day. December 1 is the preferred deadline for acceptance to the UofM and the preferred
                        day for application to the SOM for undergraduates.

                        lessons (not School of Music scholarship) or theory courses or class piano courses,
                        do not make an online application to the School.  For information on these pursuits
                        contact Music Admissions, Music Building, Room 121, musicadmissions@memphis.edu , 901.678.3766.
                     
                     
                     For your online SOM application we recommend that you use Google Chrome, Safari, or
                        Firefox browsers. Problems have been reported by students attempting to make applications
                        using Internet Explorer.
                     
                     
                     To apply to the School of Music, click here. You must create a profile account on
                        the Acceptd platform. Once your application is submitted, you will be able to revisit
                        but not change the content of your application except for resending your recommendation
                        requests. For non-technical assistance, contact music admissions .
                     
                     
                     As part of your application you will be asked to submit basic contact information
                        and questions about your musical experience and education.  You will also be asked
                        to provide names and email addresses of at least two recommenders who will be notified
                        about your request for recommendation.
                     
                     
                     The majority of concentrations require audition, so prepare to list the titles and
                        composers of your audition pieces. The essays required of Music Industry students
                        can be uploaded. Do not let the listing of titles and composers of audition pieces
                        or uploading a Music Industry essay hold up submitting your application. You can email
                        your audition pieces information or your Music Industry essay to musicadmissions@memphis.edu  two weeks prior to your audition day.
