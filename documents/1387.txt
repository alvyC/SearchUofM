                                 of the search.  Recall  If an item you need is checked out, the Circulation Desk can place a Recall on it
                                 for you. A Recall notifies the current borrower that they have 14 days to return it.  If you receive a Recall notice for something checked out to you, you will be given
                                 a maximum of 14 days to return it. A $1.00 per day fine will be charged after that
                                 time.  Hold   If an item that you would like to use is checked out, you may place a Hold on it.
