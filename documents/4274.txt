                     Materials Science - Microfabrication Laboratory
                     
                     
                     
                     The microfabrication laboratory at the University of Memphis opened in May 2013 and
                        provides a learning and research environment for students, faculty and industrial
                        parties.
                     
                     
                     The equipment in the microfabrication lab enables thin film deposition by sputtering,
                        photolithography and wire bonding. This equipment is housed in a 435 sq. ft. class
                        1000 cleanroom, which provides an environment in which the concentration of airborne
                        particles is tightly controlled (<1000 particles 0.5 microns or larger per cubic foot).
                        In addition other cleanroom environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity,
                        and pressure are maintained within specified limits. This tightly controlled cleanroom
                        environment enables the microfabrication equipment to be used for research and fabrication
                        processes at the nanoscale level.
                     
                     
                     Staff in the facility help investigators define optimal experimental conditions for
                        their microfabrication project. Investigators have the option to request IMC staff
                        to perform their microfabrication project or to be trained by IMC staff to operate
                        the microfabrication equipment.
