                        of Health, Physical Education and Recreation) was considered one of the finest recreation
                        facilities around. Between 1979 and 1982, the Campus Recreation department moved from
                        HPER to Student Affairs, then back to HPER, and in 1996 the department moved back
                        to Student Affairs in the Department of Student Life. In 1999, the Student Recreation
                        and Fitness Center was renovated and the Larry O.Finch men's basketball practice facility
                        was added. In January 2000, the building was rededicated at its grand opening as the
                        Student Recreation and Fitness Center, which housed Campus Recreation Intramural Services
                        and the Larry O. Finch Center.
                     
                     
                     The facilities include: three full-size gyms; indoor and outdoor 50-meter swimming

                     Philosophy & purpose of the Recreation center
                     
                     Campus Recreation Intramural Services (CRIS) is 110% committed to meeting the wellness
                        and recreational needs of students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends of the University
                        of Memphis. Services include exercise classes, fitness programs, leisure counseling,
                        informal recreation, competitive intramural sports, special programs/ events, club
                        sports, equipment purchase/ rental and a variety of courses/ clinics focusing on our
                        increasing leisure time. We strive to provide the very best, safe, and supervised
                        programs as well as the sound operation and timely maintenance of facilities and equipment.
                     
                     
                     The Division of Student Affairs believes that CRIS is essential to providing the contemporary,
                        well rounded university education students look for at college these days. Focused
                        on the comprehensive well-being of all members of the university community, CRIS brings
                        our campus community together through enhanced services and facilities.
                     
                     
                     Student Affairs also believes that a sense of physical well-being, as well as the
                        development of physical skills which lead to productive leisure time, are of vital
                        importance to campus life. Active participation in sports and other leisure activities
                        contributes positively to the total educational process through the development of
                        skills essential for everyday life. CRIS appreciates the meaningfulness and importance
                        of leisure time in our students' stressful lives and we develop our programs to support
                        them.
