                     All of the above are considered unacceptable.  Actions that result in charges of sexual
                        misconduct under this policy will be subject to University disciplinary action. They
                        may also subject a student or staff member  to criminal and/or civil liability under

                     Policy on Sexual Misconduct and Domestic Violence
                     
                     The University has a policy prohibiting sexual misconduct.  The University has made
                        every effort to formulate a comprehensive policy that provides students with information
                        about the applicable definitions and the process.  The policy contains definitions
                        of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking as well as information
                        regarding consent and reporting. The full policy can be read here: https://umwa.memphis.edu/umpolicies/UM1786.htm
                     
                      
                     
                     Reporting Sexual Misconduct
                     
                     There are several options available to a student who is a victim of sexual misconduct
                        and who decides to report.  In addition to bringing charges in criminal or civil court
                        the complainant may also seek recourse through the university disciplinary process
                        if the perpetrator is a student.
                     
                     
                     A complaint can be filed directly with the following University offices:
