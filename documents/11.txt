	   Get Connected. Stay Connected.
When you join the UofM Alumni Association, you join a powerful pride of Tigers. You
become part of a network that extends beyond the city of Memphis and around the world.
Membership in the UMAA is your connection to the UofM community.

Stay connected to your University through the various clubs and chapters sponsored by the Alumni Association. Keep in touch with the classmates that you spent all-nighters studying with and network with fellow alumni of a similar profession by getting involved in an academic chapter. Our various constituent groups help you connect with like-minded individuals. Have you moved across the country and need help learning the city? Network with fellow Tigers through a regional club in your area.
Each club and chapter is governed by a board of volunteers and hosts signature events annually. As important as giving monetarily to support your alma mater, is giving of your time. Share your ideas and help plan events by joining a board. Proceeds from many events support student scholarships, so show your support by attending an event and inviting your friends.

Use the navigation to the left to choose a group that you'd like to learn more about.
