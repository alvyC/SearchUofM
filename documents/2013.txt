                     The mission of the MSW program is to educate advanced professional social workers
                        for practice with at-risk populations. Housed within the School of Urban Affairs and
                        Public Policy, the Department of Social Work is dedicated to (a) educating social
                        workers with knowledge, values, and skills for evidence-based practice with children
                        and families, (b) advancing the knowledge base of the social work profession and (c)
                        providing regional leadership in the development and implementation of policies, programs
                        and services for at-risk populations.Â The program offers two concentrations: (1) Advanced
                        Practice with Children, Youth, and Families: and (2) Advanced Practice with Adults
                        and Families. Students are required to choose one of the two concentrations.Â

                              A passing score on the capstone Comprehensive Examination. The comprehensive examination
                                 for the Master of Social Work program consists of three components: 1) an evaluation
                                 of the studentâs ability to meet MSW program competencies in field placement; 2) a

                                 higher.
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        The foundation curriculum provides evidence-based knowledge, behaviors and skills
                           for social work practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations and communities.
                           The concentration curriculum allows students to extend the basic knowledge gained
                           in the foundation to a more focused advanced evidence-based practice with families
                           and childrenÂ or advanced evidence-based practice with adults and families.Â . Both
                           the foundation and concentration portions of the program emphasize evidence-based
                           practice and critical thinking skills.
                        
                        
                        To accommodate a wide range of student needs, the MSW program of study offers options
                           for full-time (4 semesters of study; 60 credit hours) and extended study (6 to 8 semesters
                           of study; 60 credit hours). Regardless of progression through the program, the educational
                           components of each sequencing option are the same. The concentration curriculum is
                           generally full-time (2 semesters), although students may choose to extend (3 to 5
                           semesters). All MSW students follow the same learning expectations for field education,
                           take the same comprehensive exam at the conclusion of the program, and meet the same
                           requirements for graduation. Courses are offered in the traditional classroom settings,
                           on-line and in a hybrid format (combination of traditional classroom and on-line).

                           to the concentration curriculum, which includes 30 credit hoursÂ in either the Advanced
                           Practice with Children, Youth, and Families concentration or the Advanced Practice
                           with Adults and Families concentration.

                        All students are required to maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00. Should the
                           studentâs cumulative GPA fall below that mark, a period of one semester will be allowed
                           to correct the deficiency. At the discretion of the chair, the coordinator of graduate
                           studies in the studentâs college, and the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Studies,
                           this period may be extended one additional semester. Students failing to improve their
                           GPA to an acceptable level in that time will be dismissed from the program.
