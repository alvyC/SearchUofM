                     The primary role of testers is to verify and validate the software produced by developers
                     to ensure its quality. Testing is designed to catch problems in the software and report
                     them for correction, so it is a conflict-laden, confrontational, and judgmental process.
                     This "audit" role of testing is inherently adversarial, ensuring the development of
                     components of interpersonal conflict judgments between developers and testers. Prior
                     research indicates that such conflict is likely to be negatively associated with software
                     quality and job satisfaction, producing negative judgments about the artifact production
                     process and about the job itself. This study addresses the question: How do judgments
                     of conflict between developers and testers impact the software development process?
                     The authors develop and empirically test a research model which proposes that the
                     conflict judgment targets of both the tasks and the persons who perform them will
                     have direct impact on both software quality and job satisfaction judgments. Results
                     of testing this model indicate that interpersonal judgments arising from conflict,
                     as well as judgments made by testers and developers about the conflict targets of
                     tasks and persons negatively influence subsequent software quality and job satisfaction
                     judgments. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.
