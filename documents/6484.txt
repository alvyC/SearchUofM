                     Our program is the leading professional undergraduate/graduate fine art photography
                        program in Tennessee and the seven surrounding Mid-American states. With the region's
                        largest photography faculty — consisting of three full-time nationally known photographers,
                        several part-time professional teachers, and a full-time experienced photo technician
                        — our students receive individual attention and in-depth instruction. Our well-equipped
                        facilities include separate black-and-white labs, color print lab, alternative process
                        lab, electronic arts lab, and studio lighting facilities. Students in our photography
                        program have a spirit of togetherness, which creates a positive, interactive place
                        to study. Their active student group, the Photographic Society, plans activities that
                        include a yearly lecture series of internationally known photographers, travel, field
                        trips, special workshops, group exhibitions, and parties. These events provide opportunities
                        to make connections with leading photographers.
                     
                     
                     Students prepare for careers in fine art photography (b&w, color, alternative process,
                        digital photography, and mixed media), documentary, freelance editorial, commercial/advertising,
                        portrait, and fashion photography, as well as teaching.
                     
                     
                     The program's educational philosophy maintains that the photographer needs first to
                        discover his or her personal vision, followed by amplification of his/her uniqueness
                        within a fine arts education. Our fine arts approach, coupled with a strong technical
                        base, provides the foundation for artistic discovery in photography: it frees students
                        to explore their own direction in photography.
                     
                     
                     Graduate students work closely with several faculty on independent self-assigned projects
                        that strengthen their personal approach. This independent work becomes the key transition
                        to a self-sufficient professional career in photography and teaching.
