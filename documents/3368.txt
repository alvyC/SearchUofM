                        entry into graduate and undergraduate programs throughout the United States. Additionally,
                        the IEI program offers courses to international professionals living in the Memphis
                        area to improve their working knowledge of English. Students have many varied opportunities
                        to interact with other participants in a friendly and professional learning environment
                        and to become an integral part of the university community.
                     
                     
                     Our Program
                     
                     The University of Memphis offers non-credit intensive English language study for university-bound
                        students as well as others who wish to become proficient in English. We offer five
                        8-week sessions during the academic year with starting dates in January, March, May,
                        August and October. Classes are small and designed to develop communication and academic
                        skills in English through speaking, listening, reading, and writing.
                     
                     
                     We offer six levels of instruction, from beginning to advanced. However, students
                        are expected to have a basic knowledge of English upon entering. New students are
                        tested at the beginning of each session and placed in the appropriate level. Full-time
                        students study 23 hours per week. F-1 students must enroll full-time; students who
                        do not have an F-1 visa may attend full- or part-time. The Director can help such
                        students choose appropriate classes.
                     
                     
                     Reading/ Writing and Grammar classes meet every morning Monday through Friday. Afternoon
                        classes, which meet Monday through Thursday, include listening/ speaking classes and
                        modules. The program is designed to be rigorous and challenging, and students are
                        expected to work diligently to improve their English. However, there is also time
                        for fun and friendship, including field trips to area sites.
