                        Baritone Kyle Ferrill, Vocal Arts Area Coordinator, is rapidly developing a reputation

                           Ferrill's special interests include Baroque music, German Lieder, and contemporary
                           music. Ferrill has sung on 5 continents, including a recent tour of China. Ferrill
                           has worked with such conductors as Stefan Asbury, Miguel Harth-Bedoya, Keith Lockhart,
                           Helmuth Rilling, Gil Rose, Robert Spano, and John Williams. Orchestras include the
