                                 Bobby is a 32 years old client at Mid-South ACT. He is very independent and wants
                                    to introduce himself and share his ideas.
                                 
                                 
                                 "I am Bobby and I was born with a disability called Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP has affected
                                    me in many ways. Extreme muscle tightness, Limited motor skills, visual impairment,
                                    and lack of right hand use are the primary difficulties that I face. Assistive Technology
                                    helps me in many different ways. I transport myself in a motorized wheelchair, and
                                    I use a walker to get around in my house. Mid-South ACT Center has helped me tremendously.
                                    One of the programs that I use on the computer is called Dragon Naturally Speaking.
                                    Dragon Naturally Speaking is a voice recognition program that allows those using it
                                    to speak into a microphone and have their text only typed into the system. The other
                                    program that I use on the computer is called Zoom Text. Zoom Text is a great program
                                    for a person that has a visual problem, because it allows one to magnify text, in
                                    order to accommodate his/her visual needs. Mid-South ACT provides individuals with
                                    many beneficial skills. It has helped me strive to reach my goals."

                                 Ms.Shirley is a 58 year old outreach client at Mid-South Access Center for Technology.
                                    She lived a full and healthy life for many years. At the age of 41 years she was diagnosed
                                    with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis which resulted in making her a quadriplegic.
                                 
                                 
                                 Although she has major motor skill limitations, assistive technology (AT) devices
                                    and software applications made it possible for her to live independently with confidence.
                                    She uses an environmental control unit (E.D.G.A.R.) to operate her television, VCR
                                    and fan. She also uses a switch access device to operate the telephone. With the assistance
                                    of voice recognition AT, i.e. Dragon Naturally Speaking, she checks her emails, does
                                    online banking, and listens to music. If you are interested in knowing more about

                                 Angelieci is a client Mid-South ACT. She has been diagnosed as legally blind due to
                                    proliferate retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, and optic atrophy. Angelieci hopes
                                    to pursue a college education in the future, and her vision impairment requires accommodations.
                                    The accommodations that she is learning at Mid-South ACT are helping her to reach
                                    her goals.
                                 
                                 
                                 Angelieci uses two assistive technology applications at Mid-South ACT. The first one
                                    is Talking Typer. This program helps her learn keyboard functions and improve her
                                    typing skills. The program orally pronounces the text that has been typed to reinforce
                                    the learning process. Another assistive technology program Angelieci uses is Zoom
                                    Text. This program magnifies text so that she sees it vividly.
