                     UofM's Hooks Institute Selects Eye on the Struggle: Ethel Payne, the First Lady of the Black Press As 2015 National Book Award Winner
                     
                     
                     September2, 2016 - The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University
                        of Memphis has selected Eye on the Struggle: Ethel Payne, the First Lady of the Black Press by James McGrath Morris as the winner of its National Book Award for 2015. The award
                        recognizes publications that best advance an understanding of the American civil rights
                        movement and its legacy.
                     
                     
                     Morris' biography excavates the story of Ethel Payne, a journalist whose work for
                        the Chicago Defender during her multi-decade career provided a lens to thousands of African-American readers
                        into the action of the civil rights movement and beyond. Covering the school desegregation
                        crisis in Little Rock, interviewing black troops in Vietnam or quizzing multiple presidents
                        during her years at the White House, Payne's career demonstrated the role journalists
                        could play both in helping to build a movement by informing the public and in furthering
                        that movement by putting pointed questions to those in power.
                     
                     
                     In his highly accessible book, Morris traces the narrative of Payne's career and adds
                        insight into her personal experiences as a pioneering black woman in the press. In
                        so doing, the book shines a light on the crucial role of the black press during the
                        civil rights movement and enlarges the field of movement icons to include a less obvious
                        piece of the larger political struggle. At the same time, Morris has explicitly inserted
                        the voice of a female figure within the movement and has helped ensure that a wider
                        range of perspectives will be included in the collective memory of this period in
                        American history. Payne's experiences span the life of the movement, and Morris effectively
                        utilizes her story to craft a true civil rights biography.
