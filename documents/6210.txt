                     Advising
                     
                     
                     All students who have declared MATH as either a major or a second major are assigned an advisor in the Math Department.
                        In the Mathematical Sciences Department, advising is done by full-time faculty. This
                        allows students to interact with an academically experienced advisor who has broad
                        subject-specific knowledge. Our advisors work individually with students on the following:
                     
                     
                     
                        	
                        Help the student plan and carry out an appropriate course of study.
                        	
                        Assist the student with scheduling issues.
                        	
                        Help the student understand the University of Memphis academic policies and regulations.
                        	
                        Connect students to scholarships that are offered through the Department.
                        
                     
                     
                     
                     How do I get a math advisor?
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Declare MATH as a major or second major, as follows:
                           
                           
                              
                              If you wish to declare a MATH major (not second major), send an email to
                                 casgraduation@memphis.edu with your name, and U-number, stating that
                                 you wish to declare a MATH major.
                              
                              
                              If you wish to declare a second major, and are not currently an Engineering major,
                                 proceed as in the previous item.
                              
                              
                              If you wish to declare a second major, and are currently an Engineering	major, contact
                                 Lori Stewart and let her know this.
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        	
                        When this is completed, send an email to James Campbell
                           stating that you have declared MATH as a major or second major, and he will assign
                           an advisor to you.
                        
                        
                     	
                     		
                     
                     Who is my advisor?
                     	
                     
                     Students can find their advisor's name at the top of UMdegree and on the Student tab
                        in
