                        the apps that we all use. Since we train you to be problems solvers, EECE graduates
                        also have the skills to work in electric power, biomedical technologies, and many
                        other technical fields, as well as business, law, and medicine.
                     
                     
                     To help students achieve their degrees in EECE, we offer both the fundamental knowledge
                        and hands-on projects through which students acquire the skills necessary to achieve
                        their goals. In addition, our department is a community of students, faculty, and
                        staff who strive for excellence in our our endeavors. We consciously try to build
                        that community through department events, student organizations, and a close relationship
                        between faculty and students. Therefore, students not only acquire the academic skils,
                        but also the personal and professional attributes that are necessary for success.

            One of the things that I like most about my education in EECE is how project-based
               most of the classes are. Project based learning has helped me gather hands on experience
               as well as increasing my portfolio.
