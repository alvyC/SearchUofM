                     Welcome.
                     
                     Thank you for your interest in the Department of Architecture. For students wishing to study architecture, we offer the professional Master of Architecture
                        degree and the pre-professional Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a major in Architecture. 
                        Together, these degrees make up the "4+2" curriculum which meets the national educational
                        standards to become an architect. For students wishing to study interior design, we offer the professional Bachelor
                        of Fine Arts degree with a major in Interior Design.  This degree meets the educational
                        requirements to become an interior designer. We believe students are our most important asset.  This is reflected in the close
                        working relationship between faculty and students in the design studios and professional/technical
                        courses.  In the design studio, students quickly find the value in peer critiques
                        and comments.  Whether in a formal setting or an informal late night conversation,
                        beginning students and more advanced students learn from each other and build upon
                        their experiences to enhance their success in the studio. And finally, our "Culture of Engagement" offers students the opportunity to work with
                        community partners and faculty and students in other academic programs on real, hands-on
                        projects to enhance the quality of life for residents within the region and beyond. 
                        Every graduate design studio and every undergraduate studio from second through fourth
                        year has at least one project per semester with a community partner. Making a decision on your education and your profession is difficult.  It is our desire
                        at the University of Memphis that each student entering any of our degree programs
                        be well informed.  Towards this, if we may be of assistance as you plan your academic
                        and professional future, please let us know. Sincerely, The Department of Architecture Faculty
