                     Graduate Assistant Meritorious Award
                     
                     The importance of the instructional enterprise in the University system is beyond
                        question. It represents one of three functions which anchor the University's role
                        in the transmission, creation, and application of advanced knowledge. The Graduate
                        Assistant Teaching Awards are made annually to two outstanding graduate teaching assistants
                        (TAs) for their skill in transmitting knowledge in the classroom/laboratory.
                     
                     
                     To be eligible for the award, the TA must:
                     
                     
                        
                        have had major responsibility for teaching a lecture or a laboratory course;
                        
                        have completed at least one full term of teaching, and
                        
                        have the support of the Department offering the course
                        
                     Candidates are nominated by faculty, students, or alumni by completing the attached
                     form. The completed form must be submitted to the Office of the Dean of the College
                     in which the student is teaching. 
                     
                     The Dean will appoint a Teaching Awards Screening Committee ( TASC ) composed of one representative selected by each of the component departments.
                     
                     
                     The Dean will appoint one at-large member who will serve as Chair. (In A & S, this
                        committee is a sub-committee of the College Council for Graduate Studies and Research.
                        (The Dean will provide secretarial support to the Committee.)
                     
                     
                     The TASC will review all applications submitted to the Dean's Office and select a maximum
                        of two nominees from that college.
                     
                     
                     EXCEPTION:
                      The College of Arts and Sciences may forward a maximum of two nominees from each
                     of two subdivisions within the College:
                     
                        
                        natural, physical, biological, and mathematical sciences,
                        
                        humanities and social sciences
                        
                     
                     
                     The selected nominations from each of the colleges are sent to the Teaching Awards
                        Committee appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School. Free standing graduate units
                        may send nominees directly to the Committee. In no case should these exceed ONE from
                        each unit.
                     
                     
                     The Awards Committee will review all applicants according to the following criteria:
                     
                     
                        
                        innovations and/or creative approaches to the teaching function
                        
                        impact of the TA upon student attitudes and/or learning skills
                        
                        assessment by faculty supervisors and/or others familiar with the TA's teaching ability
                        
                        evidence of the TA's potential as a scholar.
                        
                     
                     
                     The Awards Committee will send names of the two successful candidates to the Dean
                        of the Graduate School. No teaching award may be made to the same individual more
                        than once in a six-year period.
                     
                     
                     Student Instructional Rating Forms
                     
                     Include two complete sets of SIRS forms (or other applicable student evaluation system)
                        for two courses/sections taught. Be certain to include open ended responses. Identify
                        the course and section numbers and the specific terms during which the evaluations
                        forms were administered.
                     
                     
                     Letters of Support
                     
                     
                        
                        From Nominator: Evaluate the TA's capabilities in discharging instructional assignments.
                           Note particularly those criteria to be used by the awards committee to frame your
                           statement. It is appropriate to comment on both the quality of instruction rendered
                           by the TA and the contributions by the TA to course design and evaluation.
                        
                        
                        From Faculty: Include at least one, but no more than three letters, from colleagues
                           familiar with the nominee's teaching skills.
                        
                        
                        From Nominee: Attach a one-page statement of your view of the role/importance of teaching
                           in a university.
                        
                        
                        From Students: Include at least one, but no more than three letters, from students
                           who have been taught by the nominee. Refer to the criteria to be used by the Awards
                           Committee; particular attention should be paid to innovations or creative approaches
                           to teaching and to the impact of the TA on student attitudes and learning.
