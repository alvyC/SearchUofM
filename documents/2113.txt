                        Program, U of M, UT, or other TBR schools Employee Fee Waiver Program and Senior Citizens

                        for courses under these special fee waiver programs. Registration for courses under these programs prior to the date listed on the Bursar

                     COURSE DELETION: Registration is subject to deletion if fee payment requirements for enrollment fees
                        are not satisfied by the appropriate fee payment deadline listed in the Bursar Calendar . Unless your financial aid, scholarship, and/or third party assistance covers 100%
                        of your enrollment fees, you MUST pay the remaining balance due after awards are applied
                        by the appropriate fee payment deadline.
                     
                     
                     INSTALLMENT PAYMENT PLAN (IPP): The IPP is available for the Fall and Spring Terms. An initial down payment of 25%
                        of the balance is required after all financial aid (grants and student loans), scholarship,
                        and/or third party assistance award amounts have been applied. Housing, Dining Dollars,
                        and a $50 enrollment fee will automatically be included in IPP. Please check the Installment Payment Plan Guidelines for more details. IPP is NOT available for the Summer Terms.
                     
                     FEE INVOICES: Students are notified via their UofM email account when an electronic invoice is
                        available online on TigerXpress . Students remain responsible for completing the fee payment process by the fee payment
                        deadline, even if they do not receive a fee invoice.
                     
                     
                     CHECK PAYMENTS: Payments mailed to the Bursar's Office must be received in the Bursar's Office by
                        the appropriate fee payment deadline, regardless of the post mark date on the envelope. Please allow 5-7 days for processing.
                     
                     The University of Memphis processes paper checks electronically. When you provide
                        a check as payment (in-person, by mail, or through our drop box) you authorize the
                        use of information from your check to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from
                        your account. In certain circumstances, such as for technical or processing reasons,
                        we may process your check as a check transaction. For your reconciliation purposes,
                        these checks will appear on your monthly bank statement as an Electronic Debit.
                     
                     
                     If a check/draft or credit card payment used to satisfy enrollment fees is returned
                        dishonored by your financial institution, you will be assessed a $100 Late Payment
                        Fee, in addition to a $30 Returned Check Fee, and your registration may be deleted.
                     
                     
                     WITHDRAWALS: DO NOT wait for the University to delete your registration due to nonpayment. Students
                        are responsible for their own enrollment status. If you register and decide not to
                        attend, you MUST withdraw from all classes prior to the first day of classes on myMemphis Student Self Service to ensure that you will not owe fees and receive an "F" grade. After the first day
                        of class, if you decide not to attend or drop a course(s); you must drop that course(s)
                        from your schedule. Your fees for dropping courses maybe adjusted based on the refund
                        policy in effect on the date you drop. Withdrawals by Students Receiving Financial Aid: Dropping your last course (totally withdrawing) after the first day of class and
                        before 60% of the term has been completed will reduce your aid eligibility and may
                        result in your having to REPAY FUNDS to the University and/or the Department of Education.
                        For detailed information, please visit Financial Aid website .
                     
                     
                     NON-ATTENDANCE: Students will not be dropped from classes for failure to attend. If you register
                        and decide not to attend, you MUST withdraw on myMemphis Student Self Service before the beginning of classes for the term to avoid owing significant fees, receiving
                        "F" grades, and being liable for repayment of financial aid funds.
                     
                     
                     REGISTERING AFTER LATE REGISTRATION: Students who receive permission to register after Late Registration from the Dean
                        of their major must prepay all fees in full (IPP is not available), including the
                        assessment of a $100 Late Registration Fee and $100 Late Payment Fee prior to being
                        registered.
                     
                     
                     The University reserves the right to make changes to the schedule as necessary to
                           be consistent with policies and procedures.
