                     Religious Studies
                     
                     The Concentration in Religious Studies is designed for students with a diversity of
                        backgrounds and interests in religion. Students who are enrolled in the concentration
                        may be considering employment in fields where a knowledge of different religious traditions
                        would be an asset, such as counseling or social work, or they may be contemplating
                        further study of religion in a theological seminary or religious studies graduate
                        program. Religious Studies is a traditional liberal arts field that helps students
                        to develop skills in critical thinking, the analysis of complex issues, and oral and
                        written expression.

                     The senior project is a student's culminating experience or capstone designed to synthesize
                        and integrate the content of a student's program of study. The senior project is intended
                        to fuse together the two or more academic areas that comprise the coordinated study
                        (major) into an academically-relevant example of scholarship.
                     
                     
                     The Senior Project is completed during a student's final semester.

                        for knowing and satisfying all course prerequisites. Please view course descriptions

                     Experiential Learning Credit Opportunities
                     
                     Students seeking degrees in University College may be granted credit for college level
                        knowledge and understanding related to the student's major area of study and gained
                        from work experience, life experience, or non-college instruction. The student who
                        wants an assessment of such learning prepares a portfolio that describes and documents
                        the learning. Portfolios are assessed by faculty who teach in that area.
                     
                     
                     Assessment by portfolio is reserved for knowledge and competencies which do not readily
                        fit into the credit by examination procedures. More detailed information about procedures
                        may be obtained from the advisor.
