                     Facilities
                     
                     The Library has listening stations equipped with CD players, cassette decks, receivers,
                        and turntables, as well as stations for viewing VHS and DVD recordings. Equipment
                        is in place also for viewing all standard microformats. The Music Library has eight
                        public PCs and two iMacs, which are part of the University network. There is no public
                        printing in the Music Library, but work may be saved on thumb drive or the UM Drive,
                        or may be emailed for printing elsewhere.
                     
                     
                     Materials
                     
                     The collection totals about 47,000 volumes of books, scores and bound periodicals,
                        17,000 pieces of microforms, and 20,000 recordings. About 150 composers are represented
                        in the sets of complete works. Among the noteworthy historical microforms collections
                        are: Oettingen-Wallerstein collection of manuscripts and printed scores from court
                        and monastery libraries of early 17th to late 19th century eastern Germany. Complete
                        manuscripts of Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and Telemann from the Staatsbibliothek zu
                        Berlin. Music Manuscripts from the Great English Collections - primarily early 16th
                        to late 18th century manuscripts held by the British Library, Oxford University, and
                        other major English libraries. All performances held in the School of Music are recorded,
                        and the compact discs (or other formats for earlier years) and programs are housed
                        in the Music Library. CDs for the past two years may be checked out under the same
                        guidelines as commercial CDs. There are two special indexes to the recital collection:
                        Memphis Composers Index - indexes works of Memphis area composers found on the recordings;
                        New Music Festival Index - indexes all works performed for the annual Imagine Festival.
