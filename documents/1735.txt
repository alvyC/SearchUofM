                     PHOTOS Steeped in the gentle lyricism we associate with nostalgic portraits of American youth,
                        Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, How I Learned to Drive, is also deals with
                        often times unspoken and long-term influences of sexual abuse. This searing drama
                        illuminates the the emotional changes in a teenager's psyche, the physical changes
                        in a woman's body, and about the way the one fits into the other which ultimately
                        result in the definition of one's adult self. The New York Times called DRIVE "a heartbreaking
                        and wonderful new play . . . that startles at every turn. The play is angry and compassionate,
                        light-handed and devastating."
