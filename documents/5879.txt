                     Great expectations of you.
                     
                     Every new college student needs to be prepared for what the University will expect
                        from him or her. Introducing yourself into the University setting requires that you
                        abide by certain codes of conduct, both academically and morally. By accepting admittance
                        and enrolling, you have voluntarily committed yourself to be a part of the University
                        of Memphis community. With this commitment comes responsibility and a realization
                        that you are willingly applying yourself to the pursuit of elevated educational and
                        social goals. These include actively searching for higher knowledge, exhibiting behavior
                        that demonstrates respect towards other students, faculty, and staff of the University,
                        and generally following the University's procedural guidelines.
                     
                     
                     What are the major sources of documented information that new students receive from
                           the University of Memphis?
                     
                     All students can access the online University Catalog, which contains degree program
                        planning and a list of all courses and areas of study, a Student Handbook, including
                        the regulations for academic and social conduct on campus, and a Schedule of Classes
                        for the current semester. It is the student's responsibility to read each of these
                        documents and understand which courses are required for his/her major, how courses
                        in a particular curriculum can be scheduled during a given semester, and what the
                        code of conduct is for all courses at this University. Because curriculum requirements
                        can change, the student is responsible for being knowledgeable about current information
                        to best complete a program. Regularly meeting with one's advisor is the best way to
                        avoid problems in this area.
                     
                     
                     What are specific academic expectations at the University of Memphis?
                     
                     Success in college relies on the student's ability to utilize resources and to be
                        responsible for his/her own progress. Allowing study time of two to three hours for
                        each hour spent in class is recommended and cumulative GPAs that drop below a "C"
                        will be cause for academic suspension from the University once the student has earned
                        more than 68 hours. Financial Aid and Scholarships are also subject to review and
                        revocation depending on one's academic standing. Your ACAD section and the Educational
                        Support Program are instituted to help prevent academic hardship.
                     
                     
                     What is academic status?
                     
                     The academic progress of students at the University of Memphis is monitored at the
                        conclusion of each term enrolled to determine their academic status. Students' overall
                        combined grade point average AND term grade point average are considered in determining
                        status. There are four progressive levels of academic status: (1) Good Standing (2) Academic Warning (3) Academic Probation (4) Academic Suspension Your academic status will be listed on your grade report in myMemphis at the end of
                        each semester. More information about academic levels can be found in the University
                        Catalog.
                     
                     
                     What are the basic educational requirements for completing a degree program?
                     
                     Although one's particular major will determine the majority of courses that should
                        be taken, exposure to a variety of subjects is part of the General Education requirement.
                        Such courses ensure that the student becomes a well-educated member of society with
                        knowledge extending beyond the expertise nurtured in one area of study. This General
                        Education core curriculum was developed at the University of Memphis in 1989 to enrich
                        the undergraduate experience. In addition, students entering this University who demonstrate,
                        through testing, that they are not prepared for college-level work in math, English,
                        or reading must begin their studies with courses offered by the Transitional Academic
                        Studies Department.
                     
                     
                     What type of degree programs are available to students at the University of Memphis?
                     
                     The University of Memphis offers undergraduates a choice of 54 majors and 73 concentrations.
                        Degrees available include Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music,
                        Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor or Liberal Studies, Bachelor of Professional
                        Studies, and a variety of Bachelor of Science programs. While most majors require
                        completion of at least 120 semester hours.
