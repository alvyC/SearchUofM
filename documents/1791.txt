                     July 14, 2016 - The FedEx Institute of Technology will host a two-day intensive workshop,
                        "Blockchain for Professionals," Thursday, Aug. 4, and Friday, Aug. 5, in the Zone
                        conference room in the FedEx Institute. Blockchain technology is a critical component
                        of modern cyber security infrastructure and first gained prominence as the backbone
                        of bitcoin. While the technology has its roots in financial transactions, its potential,
                        which relies on a distributed database architecture, represents a critical shift in
                        how data is secured and managed.
                     
                     
                     Participants will learn how blockchain technology is disrupting existing business
                        models and will gain insights into paradigmatic changes occurring from economic, organizational
                        and computer science viewpoints. As a result, they will be able to develop their own
                        new value creating information systems.
                     
                     
                     As learning outcomes, the participants will receive computer science, information
                        systems and business knowledge background in order to analyze existing business processes
                        and their potential to convert them into blockchain-based solutions. In doing so,
                        they will be able to co-create new blockchain-based cryptographic economic systems.
