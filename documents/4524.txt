                     Dear Campus Community:
                     
                     I spent the last two days in Nashville and attended Governor Haslam's state of the

                        outcomes portion and $4.6M as UofM's share of the $50M in new formula funding). The
                        Governor also recommended $5.3M in capital maintenance funds. It was clear from the
                        Governor's comments that there is an expectation to minimize tuition increases across
                        the state. As you know, we have shown a strong commitment to containing student costs
                        and tuition increases, with no tuition increase two years ago and an increase of less
                        than 3% last year. It is important to note that a number of bills have been filled
                        that would cap tuition increases at TN colleges and universities. I'll keep you updated
                        as these bills move through the legislative process.
                     
                     
                     As you also know, Governor Haslam submitted legislation providing for local governing
                        boards for TBR universities. There appears to be broad support for this bill, and
                        we have every expectation it will pass, allowing the University of Memphis to establish
                        its own governing board in 2017. We are well into the evaluation and preparation process.
                        I shared the legislation with deans, chairs, directors and the Faculty Senate a few
                        weeks ago. Provost Weddle-West and I have offered to meet with various constituencies
                        as needed or requested to discuss the transition. Please let me know if you have any
                        questions or concerns.
                     
                     
                     As a reminder, we are also pursuing additional funding for our Lambuth campus, along
                        with a supplemental budget request for the Memphis Research Consortium (our partnership
                        with UT Health Science Center and St. Jude). Again, I'll keep you updated as information
                        becomes available. Thank you for your continued hard work for and dedication to our
                        students, university and the City of Memphis. Our positive growth in formula dollars
                        is certainly the direct consequence of this hard work.
                     
                     
                     Best wishes for an enjoyable and productive spring semester.
