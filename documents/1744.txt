                     In BECKY SHAW, a newlywed couple fixes up two romantically challenged friends: wife's
                        best friend, meet husband's sexy and strange new co-worker. When an evening calculated
                        to bring happiness takes a dark turn, crisis and comedy ensue in this wickedly funny
                        play. "Gina Gionfriddo's comedy of bad manners, a tangled tale of love, sex and ethics
                        among a quartet of men and women in their thirties, is as engrossing as it is ferociously
                        funny." —NY Times.
