                     PURPOSES
                     
                     The College of Arts and Sciences has three distinct functions within the framework
                        of the University.
                     
                     
                     1) Its primary function is to offer a strong liberal arts program designed to help
                        the students prepare themselves for life in their own cultural setting by acquiring
                        the means and desire to continue the processes of intellectual development and character
                        formation throughout their lives. "The purpose of education," wrote John Stuart Mill,
                        "is to make capable and cultivated human beings." "Education has for its object the
                        formation of character," wrote Herbert Spencer. We believe that people are people,
                        no matter what their careers, and that if we can help people to become more capable
                        and sensible, they will have better careers and lives. It is our belief that the best
                        preparation for any profession or vocation is a thorough foundation in those major
                        fields of human interest, which are included in the humanities, the natural sciences,
                        and the social sciences. A program of liberal studies at the University of Memphis
                        aims to provide the students with a store of factual knowledge, to introduce them
                        to varying sets of principles, to stimulate them to think about and evaluate facts
                        and principles, and to encourage them to order their own affairs and those of their
                        society with the talent, insight, and discrimination they develop.
                     
                     
                     2) The College of Arts and Sciences offers this kind of education to the candidates
                        for its own degrees, and to the students of other colleges of the University, all
                        of whose degree plans call for courses in the arts and sciences.
                     
                     
                     3) The college offers preparatory courses for students interested in careers in medicine,
                        dentistry, nursing, teaching, law and other professions; specific pre-professional
                        programs, designed to prepare students to qualify for admission to professional schools,
                        are available.
