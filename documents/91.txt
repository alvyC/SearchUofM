                     Big Data Certificate Program
                     
                     Big Data is a massive topic covering a range of disciplines, practices, and implementations.
                        While many experience a portion of the concept of big data in their work, rarely does
                        anyone experience the full spectrum of issues, challenges, and opportunities inherent
                        in the discipline. The Big Data Certificate is designed to provide context for the
                        range of topics associated with big data and analytics. The skill level for the workshop
                        is beginner - intermediate; participants will take away a deep knowledge of the applications
                        of big data as well as the ability to apply the discipline to their own work environment.

                     New Data Management Paradigms: 
                     
                     Emerging technologies in data management mean that we are no longer restricted to
                        the traditional data structure paradigms. Traditional methods of querying and organization
                        do not necessarily scale to the levels of big data or provide the necessary comprehensive
                        solutions big data requires. This two day program will cover the new data management
                        paradigms with a focus on NOSQL and NEWSQL.

                     The Big Data and Analytics Research Cluster at the FedEx Institute of Technology is
                        committed to the development of innovative research, corporate partnerships, and community
                        engagement in the wide range of analytics tools and techniques and of the underlying
                        databases that support them. We believe that the world-class researchers at the University
                        of Memphis, together with the vibrant, high-tech Memphis corporate community, has
                        the potential to lead the nation in these state-of-the-art fields. By leveraging the
                        knowledge and talents of the big data and analytics academic and corporate experts
                        in Memphis and the Mid-South Region, the FedEx Institute will be the coordinator and
                        center of activity in this critical field.
                     
                     
                     About The Cluster
                     
                     The Big Data and Analytics Research Cluster represents a major interdisciplinary collaborative
                        effort dedicated to research, education, and technology transfer at the University's
                        FedEx Institute of Technology. The University of Memphis has top-level researchers
                        in several of its academic units who focus on big data and analytics technologies
                        in their research and teaching. Memphis and the greater Mid-South Region include many
                        corporations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies that excel in the
                        use of data to gain a competitive advantage and to solve previously intractable problems
                        through the advanced use of their data resources.
                     
                     
                     The FedEx Institute of Technology at the University of Memphis is positioned and is
                        highly motivated to serve as a development and coordination engine in support of local
                        industry's efforts to utilize the latest big data and analytics technologies in support
                        of their businesses. The Big Data Analytics Research Cluster will consider tools that
                        include data mining, text mining, web mining, data visualization, expert systems,
                        and knowledge-based systems. Within these tools, we will consider such techniques
                        as neural networks, decision trees, various statistical methods, and advanced search
                        methods. Supporting these analytics tools and techniques, we will leverage historically-based
                        data warehouses and the advanced "NoSQL" database technologies that include key-value
                        databases, document databases, column family or "big table" databases, and graph databases,
                        plus the latest "NewSQL" databases. The Big Data and Analytics initiatives include:
