                        Study Reveals Evolutionary History of Beetles
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     
                     		
                     
                     
                     "Tree of Life" Study Reveals Evolutionary History of Beetles
                     
                     July 28, 2015 - From ladybugs to fireflies, beetles have captivated naturalists and
                        others throughout history. Now an international team of beetle experts is providing
                        a glimpse of life before dinosaurs by assembling a new view of one of the largest
                        branches of the Tree of Life.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Duane McKenna, assistant professor of biological sciences, was lead author of
                        a study published recently in Systematic Entomology that used DNA sequences and other
                        information to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Earth's most diverse group
                        of animals.
                     
                     
                     "There are nearly 400,000 known species of beetles, and easily more than 1 million
                        total species alive today," said McKenna. "This work provides new insights into relationships
                        among the major groups of beetles, including groups that contain species with important
                        ecological roles – for example, pollinators, plant-feeders, predators, and recyclers
                        of wood, leaves, and dung, and important pest species. It also reveals new insights
                        into the evolutionary history of beetles, including the age of beetles (more than
                        250 million years), timing and patterns of beetle diversification, and when and how
                        certain habits like plant feeding likely originated. While focused on beetle relationships
                        and evolution, our work also has more general implications for understanding the origins
                        and evolution of terrestrial biological diversity."
                     
                     
                     Combing the world for 10 years, the scientists collected DNA of both common and rare
                        beetles in their quest to unravel some of the mysteries behind the development of
                        this exceptionally successful group of animals. They examined the DNA of nearly 400
                        carefully selected species that represented all major lineages of beetles. "Our reconstruction
                        reveals that low extinction rates, protected wings and ancient interaction with plants,
                        fungi and microorganisms appear to be the main keys to their success," said McKenna.
