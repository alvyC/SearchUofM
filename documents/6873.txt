                     Past Information Systems (IS) research on knowledge creation has not adequately accounted
                     for the evolutionary nature of knowledge. Research limitations also exist in depicting
                     the roles of information in the knowledge creation process. These two problems present
                     difficulties for practitioners when attempting to successfully implement Information
                     Technology (IT) to facilitate knowledge creation. Based on a problem-solving paradigm,
                     this research analyzes knowledge creation from both the evolutionary and information-processing
                     perspectives. The resultant theory outlines a process whereby tentative knowledge
                     is generated from varied existing knowledge and applied to a problem, producing information
                     to test the extent to which the problem can be solved. An iterative process continues
                     until the tentative knowledge with the highest potential to solve the problem is found,
                     yielding the information to best meet the goal. This process is further embedded in
                     an organization-wide problem-solving hierarchy where new knowledge is developed via
                     the integration of knowledge elements of sub-problems. By incorporating the evolutionary
                     nature of knowledge, this research provides a deeper understanding of the knowledge
                     creation process and the key determinants of its success. More importantly, by clearly
                     specifying the roles of information in the process, it offers promise in the better
                     design of IT to improve knowledge creation performance. We develop a framework based
                     on this Evolutionary Information-Processing Theory to aid practitioners in IS design.
