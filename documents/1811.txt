                     April 29, 2016 - The University of Memphis, along with the National Park Service,
                        will host "Memories of a Massacre: Memphis in 1866, a Symposium Exploring Slavery,
                        Emancipation and Reconstruction" May 20-21 in the University Center Theatre on campus.
                     
                     
                     This is the first public recognition of the Memphis Massacre, an event that was the
                        first in a series of large-scale acts of Reconstruction-era racial violence and played
                        a profound role in shaping the basic legal, civil and political structures that shape
                        our lives today.
                     
                     
                     The symposium, composed of seven panels, will feature nationally acclaimed authors,
                        historians and scholars from across the nation, including Robert K. Sutton, chief
                        historian for the National Park Service. Together these panels and discussions will
                        navigate the turbulent and largely suppressed history of Reconstruction racial politics,
                        tensions and events to provide a deeper understanding of Reconstruction, its legacies,
                        and the significant role Memphis played in shaping both.
                     
                     
                     "Our goal is to break the silence, to make public the story of freedom's unruly rebirth,
                        and most especially, to draw attention to the role of the recently freed in what was,
                        by any measure, a revolutionary period. In doing this, we will not only be teaching
                        history, we will be making history," said Dr. Susan Eva O'Donovan, associate professor
                        of history and symposium co-director.
