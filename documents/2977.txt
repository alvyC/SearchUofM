                        Developed in collaboration with Residence Life, the First HIRES program will not only
                        provide our students with disabilities with strong transferable skills and enhance
                        their resumes, but also help them get better connected to the University of Memphis.
                        Students in the First HIRES Program work as desk assistants in our on-campus residence
                        halls. This position is customer service-oriented. Desk assistants help residents,
                        answer telephones, and monitor activity in the lobby of the building. They also communicate
                        information to other staff members as necessary.

                        disabilities who are eager to prove their abilities in the workplace through internships
                        and/or jobs.
                     
                     
                     Career Mentoring Program : A program for students interested in gaining more information about what it is like
                        to work "in the real world" with a disability. Students or job seekers who have a
                        disability are paired with a career mentor who also has a disability; the experience
                        could include job shadowing, identifying necessary job skills, and learning about
                        possible internships or employment prospects.
