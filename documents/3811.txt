						MALS Program Offers New Hope to Graduate Student

			One of the most unusual degrees on campus is the Masters of Arts in Liberal Studies (MALS) in the University College. It allows graduate students to design their own interdisciplinary degree. The University College describes the degree as “designed for those seeking the personal enrichment provided by liberal learning, this degree encourages the development of intellectual skills necessary for lifelong learning—critical reading, scholarly writing, and the art of interpersonal communication.” Given the broad nature of the degree, it attracts a wide range of students from a variety of backgrounds. One such student is D eveeshree Nayak, who came to the United States from India in 2013; she completed her MALS degree in August 2015 and has gone on to pursue masters degrees in the department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, as well as in Business Information Technology.
Nayak was very impressed with the support and individual attention in the University College, saying “many people encouraged and believed in my potential. Dr. Keith Sisson and the entire liberal studies department played a vital role in my success. I was blessed to have him as my professor and mentor.” After struggling in a different degree program, Nayak realized that she was looking for a different kind of degree. She sought out Dr. Sisson, who helped her outline her own graduate degree that incorporated her existing graduate credits while also fulfilling both the Graduate School’s requirements and the MALS degree requirements. While creating a unique degree might seems daunting, Nayak felt confident, “I never looked back again. The MALS program offered me the flexibility to choose my own courses. Dr. Sisson was very encouraging. I am always proud to be a Memphis Tiger and my dream is to finish a Ph.D. at the University of Memphis.”
As an international student, Nayak faced challenges of which American students might not be aware. Legally, international students cannot work off-campus and may only live in University housing, which can make life very complicated if they need to take a semester off or if they are placed on academic probation. Many traditional students who are placed on probation or have personal crises are able to take off a semester to regroup, save money, and then return to their students, but international students do not have this luxury.
Despite facing these challenges on top of the usual rigors of graduate study, Nayak has excelled. She has been awarded several scholarships, including the 2014 Facebook Security DEFCON scholarship, and is involved in her discipline, presenting papers and attending conferences. She has also been awarded a number of National Science Foundation (NSF) and other travel grants to attend a variety of conferences, including the Women Institute for Summer Enrichment (WISE), Security Education (SEED) Workshop, and the Google I/O conference. She credits her family and the supportive faculty and staff of the University College for her success; she was thrilled to find a path that is well-suited to her interests and career goals.
