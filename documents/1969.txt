                        does not count as credit toward the degree, but is reported on the transcript. There
                        is a limitation of three 6000-level courses for credit toward the MS degree.

                        select a different accounting elective instead. 4 For students without significant training in database systems, the first three of
                        these electives are recommended.
                     
                     
                     IV. PhD Program
                     
                     The goal of the Ph.D. concentration in Accounting is to develop the next generation
                        of committed scholars and excellent teachers by providing an active and stimulating
                        intellectual environment.Â  The Accounting Ph.D. program prepares doctoral students
                        for research-oriented academic positions at well-regarded universities and colleges
                        that demand solid teaching skills. We train doctoral students in classroom management
                        and the development of solid teaching skills.Â  Research in the School of Accountancy
                        focuses on economic based issues of importance to the accounting and business community
                        such as the impact of accounting information on capital market participants as well
                        as other firm stakeholders.Â 
                     
                     
                     Reflecting the research orientation of the faculty, development of research and academic
                        writing skills is continually emphasized throughout the Ph.D. program. The faculty
                        goal for matriculation is four years.Â  In seminars, doctoral students are encouraged
                        to start working on the framework for the dissertation early in the first year aligned
                        with research experts in the field. Â In the first two years, students focus on their
                        coursework, are involved in a research workshop, and work closely with faculty on
                        a research project. Students take their comprehensive examinations at the beginning
                        of the third year. In their third and fourth years of study, students develop and
                        present their thesis proposal, then complete and defend the dissertation.
                     
                     
                     A major strength of the Ph.D. program in accounting is that its graduate faculty members
                        are student-oriented.Â  Research with faculty is encouraged and fostered in a highly
                        collegial environment.Â  We emphasize a close faculty-doctoral student interaction.
                        Only a few students are admitted into the doctoral program each year and they are
                        encouraged to work closely as a team cohort.Â  Â  Doctoral students are involved in
                        all phases of faculty research, including co-authorship of research papers and presentations
                        at professional meetings. Most of the current doctoral students are CPAs with business
                        experience at the most prestigious corporate accounting and public accounting firms.
                     
                     
                     Our graduate faculty members have published books and received academic honors that
                        include chaired professorships. Â The accounting faculty publish their research in
                        the top tier accounting journals such as The Accounting Review, Contemporary Accounting,
                        Research, Journal of Accounting and Economics as well as the highly regarded journals
                        of the American Accounting Association in sub-discipline fields, among others.
