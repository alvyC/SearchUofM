                     Students must also attend an annual meeting held for all students enrolled in the
                        Certificate of Health Law program.
                     
                     
                     Grade Point Requirement
                     
                     To satisfy the requirements of the Certificate in Health Law, each student must demonstrate
                        a successful understanding of the fundamentals of health law by holding a minimum
                        2.5 overall GPA and obtaining at least a C in each course and a minimum 2.5 overall
                        GPA in the building-block courses of Torts I and Torts II, and Constitutional Law.

                     When to Enroll
                     
                     Students in good academic standing may enroll after completing one year of full-time
                        law study (or thirty hours as a part-time student). It is highly recommended that
                        a student enroll by the add deadline of his/her third semester. (There is no penalty
                        to later decide to drop from the program.) Students cannot enroll after the add deadline
                        in the student's fourth semester (or, if part-time, of the semester after completion
                        of forty-five hours of study).
                     
                     
                     How to Enroll
                     
                     .A student enrolls by submitting a completed enrollment form (available on TWEN) to the Institute Director. In completing the form, the student
                        must certify that he/she can satisfy the requirements of the certificate program and
                        is committed to fulfilling its requirements. A student will be dropped from the program
                        if he/she fails to meet the requirements.
