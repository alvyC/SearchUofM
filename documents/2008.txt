                        Prospective students, in addition to meeting the requirements for admission to The
                           Graduate School, are required to present as a prerequisite for admission a satisfactory
                           record of undergraduate work in physics. Normally 21 credit hours of physics course
                           work will be required, including classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, modern
                           physics, quantum physics, and thermal physics, and 12 credit hours of calculus and
                           differential equations. Students who are deficient in undergraduate work may be admitted
                           on a conditional basis and would be allowed to take graduate courses only after fulfilling
                           the undergraduate course deficiencies. Submission of general GRE score is strongly
                           recommended for admission.

                     Highly motivated and talented students may pursue an undergraduate degree (B.S.) in
                        Physics followed by a graduate (M.S.) in Physics in a special five-year program. This
                        option requires serious commitment, careful planning with the studentâs advisor, and
                        summer research work leading toward a Masterâs thesis. Carefully tailored course of
                        study allow students in this program to complete their B.S. degree while they also
                        begin the coursework towards their M.S. Students interested in pursuing this option
                        should contact both the undergraduate and graduate advisors in the Department of Physics
                        and Materials Science early in their undergraduate career.
