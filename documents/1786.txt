                     UofM, Methodist and Le Bonheur Partner to Enhance Operations at Speech & Hearing Center
                     
                     July 28, 2016- Under a new partnership, Methodist Healthcare and Le Bonheur Children's
                        Hospital will soon manage the business operations of the Memphis Speech & Hearing
                        Center (MSHC), housed in the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders at the
                        University of Memphis.
                     
                     
                     The term of the agreement runs from Sept. 1, 2016, through Aug. 31, 2019.
                     
                     Under the partnership, the two organizations will manage business operations, including
                        billing and electronic medical records. MSHC clinical staff will continue to work
                        for the University of Memphis; students will continue to have access to clients and
                        faculty in the clinic.
                     
                     
                     The partnership will allow MSHC to greatly enhance the programs it offers to the community.
                        "Together, the UofM, Methodist Healthcare and Le Bonheur are deepening their resolve
                        to serve the community by providing expert services and care to those with speech
                        and hearing disorders across the Mid-South," said UofM President M. David Rudd. "Our
                        growing partnership is just one example of how the UofM seeks to maximize its corporate
                        relationships for the benefit of the entire community. We look forward to enhanced
                        service and student achievement as a result of this partnership."
                     
                     
                     Danielle Keeton, director of Outpatient Rehab and Developmental Services at Le Bonheur,
                        said, "Being an alumna of the UofM School of Communication Sciences and Disorders,
                        I am personally honored to be involved in this partnership. The programmatic strengths
                        of Methodist, Le Bonheur and the UofM combined will create a platform for innovation
                        and the highest clinical quality. We are excited to gain the clinical expertise of
                        the nationally ranked UofM faculty, and we share the Memphis Speech & Hearing Center's
                        passion for serving our Mid-South community."
                     
                     
                     Dr. Linda Jarmulowicz, interim dean of the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders,
                        said, "This unique partnership could become a national model for clinical training
                        of communication healthcare providers. We are excited that our students of speech-language
                        pathology and audiology will have expanded opportunities to be supervised onsite in
                        the Memphis Speech & Hearing Center before being sent offsite for clinical training.
                        The additional opportunities for students to learn electronic medical records procedures
                        before they go into the workforce will enhance their employability. Conversely, Methodist
                        and Le Bonheur staff will have the opportunity to work with us, to have access to
                        faculty and to develop new programs with us."
                     
                     
                     UofM Provost Karen Weddle-West added, "The partnership connects the School of CSD's
                        state-of-the-art facility with the Methodist and Le Bonheur network, while maintaining
                        the Memphis Speech & Hearing Center's mission of high-quality, innovative services
                        to the community and clinical education for the students in the School. We hope to
                        see continued growth in the clinic and the School over the next few years."
