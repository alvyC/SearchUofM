                     We are excited to share the fifth issue of our law school magazine, ML, with all of
                        our alumni, students and friends.
                     
                     
                     In this issue, we examine Bitcoin and the numerous legal issues surrounding this complicated
                        and sometimes misunderstood digital currency. From taxation and currency matters,
                        to regulatory questions and money-laundering concerns, Bitcoin may be the "most-known
                        unknown" in the world of digital technology.
                     
                     
                     Don't forget to check out the special feature on technology in the healthcare industry,
                        as well as an interesting look at the experiences and expectations of our students
                        enrolled in the inaugural semester of our Medical-Legal Partnership clinic. Additionally,
                        we have a question-and-answer feature with our new Memphis Mayor, Jim Strickland (JD
                        '89) and a special op-ed by Professor John Newman focusing on the real cost of "free"
                        in the online world.
                     
                     
                     All of this and MUCH MORE is ready for your reading pleasure in this issue!
