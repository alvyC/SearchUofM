                     Section 7 addresses the storage and handling information for the chemical. This is an important section as it contains information
                        on the flammability, explosive risk, propensity to form peroxides, and chemical incompatibility
                        for the substance. It also addresses any special storage requirements for the chemical
                        (i.e., special cabinets or refrigerators).
                     
                     
                     Section 8 outlines the regulatory limits for exposure , usually the maximum per­missible exposure limits (PEL) (refer to Appendix G). The
                        PEL, issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, tells the concentration
                        of air contamination a person can be exposed to for 8 hours a day, 40 hours per week
                        over a working lifetime (30 years) without suffering adverse health effects. It also
                        provides information on personal protective equipment.
                     
                     
                     Section 9 gives the physical and chemical properties of the chemical. Information such as the evaporation rate, specific gravity, and
                        flash points are given.
                     
                     
                     Section 10 gives the stability and reactivity of the chemical with information about chemical incompatibilities and conditions
                        to avoid.
                     
                     
                     Section 11 provides both the acute and chronic toxicity of the chemical and any health effects that may be attributed to the chemical.
                     
                     
                     Section 12 identifies both the ecotoxicity and the environmental fate of the chemical.
                     
                     
                     Section 13 offers suggestions for the disposal of the chemical. Local, state, and Federal regulations
                        should be followed.
                     
                     
                     Section 14 gives the transportation information required by the Department of Transportation.
                        This often identifies the dangers associated with the chemical, such as flammability,
                        toxicity, radioactivity, and reactivity.
                     
                     
                     Section 15 outlines the regulatory information for the chemical. The hazard codes for the chemical
                        are given along with principle hazards associated with the chemical. A variety of
                        country and/or state specific details may be given.
                     
                     
                     Section 16 provides additional information such as the label warnings, preparation and revision
                        dates, name of the person or firm that prepared the SDS, disclaimers, and references
                        used to prepare the SDS.
