                     competition, economic downturn, and the potential offered by emerging technologies
                     are pushing firms to fundamentally rethink their business processes. Many firms have
                     reached the conclusion that effecting business process change is the only way to leverage
                     their core competencies and achieve competitive advantage. This belief has led to
                     a near "re-engineering frenzy."
                     
                     Consultants, seeking to provide solutions to these issues, prescribe business process
                        re-engineering (BPR) as a means to re-engineer aging processes to achieve strategic
                        objectives. BPR practitioners typically repackage existing change theories and techniques
                        from organizational behavior and design, information system management, operations
                        research, quality and human resources disciples in a new synthesis directed at dramatic
                        improvements in business performance.
                     
                     
                     While earlier cross-functional process redesign conceptualizations including Porter's
                        [93] value chain analysis and Gibson and Jackson's [38] business transformation via
                        information technology (IT) existed, it was the writings of both Davenport and Short
                        [21] and Hammer [48] that triggered intense interest from both academia practitioners
                        in re-engineering. Similar to the "classic" success stories touted on strategic information
                        systems about a decade ago [64], early literature on BPR included many examples of
                        BPR successes, such as Ford, Hallmark, Bell Atlantic, Taco Bell [47], AT&T [45], Kodak
                        [108], Texas Instruments, Merck and Cigna [104].
                     
                     
                     Despite the five odd years this phenomenon has been the rage, there is little research
                        support for its effectiveness beyond anecdotal evidence. This is in part because no
                        theory describing, explaining, and predicting the impact of BPR has been presented
                        to guide the progress of empirical research. In fact, the role that this phenomenon
                        has played in the formalization and advancement of management theory (or vice versa)
                        remains a relatively unexplored topic.
                     
                     
                     Clearly, the purpose of radical process change (re-engineering), as well as more incremental
                        business process improvement approaches (continuous improvement), is the transformation
                        of business processes. The desire to achieve such transformation has served to propel
                        practice ahead of formalized theory. We believe that the formalization of the theoretical
                        context of effective business process change management is essential for improved
                        implementation and, more generally, to advance systematic inquiry in the field.
                     
                     
                     The goal of this special section introduction is to present discussion that moves
                        toward a theory of business process change (BPC) management. The beginnings of such
                        a theory are based upon both conceptual synthesis of observations from practice as
                        well as drawn from research literature from several related social science disciples.
                     
                     
                     Our analysis leads to the conclusion that the theoretical basis of business process
                        change should concern the creation of an organizational environment that develops
                        a culture supportive of change through learning, knowledge sharing (including IT enablement),
                        and internal and external network partnering which facilitates the implementation
                        of effective process and change management practice, which leads to improvement in
                        business processes and greater stakeholder benefits, both of which are important in
                        achieving measurable performance improvements. Implied in this statement is the vital
                        role that the strategic leader plays in establishing strategic initiatives such as
                        communicating a vision to move the organization toward business process change and
                        providing tangible support to enable and maintain an organizational environment that
                        is receptive to BPC management practice.
