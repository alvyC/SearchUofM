COLLABORATIVE PIANIST REQUESTS
Procedures and Policies
    The Priority deadline is 5pm on Friday, May 6, 2015. Online applications may still be accepted after this date, according to GA availability.

  Only pieces and the event(s) listed on the application form will be covered by GA duties, the GA is not obliged to perform other works or dates.
  Collaborative Pianist GA requests will be considered according to a combination of the following criteria: Difficulty level of the piano part; Scheduling of the Recital;  Current schedule of the GA; Balance between the instrumental and vocal areas. Ensembles are the first priority, and then school-affiliated performances (e.g. degree recitals).
  Only Collaborative Piano GA requests pertaining to a ensemble, degree, or other school-affiliated performance can be considered. The GA will be expected to rehearse and perform in lessons for their assigned piece, and for any pre-arranged studio classes, according to scheduling. Any additional duties, e.g. external concerts, recordings, Graduate School auditions, must be compensated separately. The standard fee for compensating a student pianist outside of their GA assignment is $30 per hour rehearsal, and/or an agreed Recital Fee negotiated in advance.
  Results: GAs will be asked to contact their assigned students within a few weeks.
  Not all requests can be fulfilled, due to limited availability. For applications not covered by GAs, there is a list of additional pianists for hire on the noticeboard outside room 283.
  If a student reschedules their recital without consulting their assigned pianist, they forfeit their pianist.
  GA responsibilities do not carry over into another semester, if recitals/performances have been postponed or rescheduled.

Student Responsibilities:

   Provide their pianist with music in a timely fashion.
  Inform their pianist of any performances (studio classes, rescheduled lessons, etc.) in a timely fashion.
  Secure rehearsal locations for each rehearsal, unless informed otherwise by their pianist.
  To be respectful and professional to the GA.

Pianist Commitments:

      To learn the music by the first rehearsal (if music was received in a timely fashion).
  To attend rehearsals and lessons as arranged.
  To accommodate reasonable scheduling requests or changes.
  To be respectful and professional to the Faculty and Students.
