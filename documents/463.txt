                     Overview
                     
                     As part of the University's General Education Program, the Department strives to imbue
                        students with skills involved in critical thinking and problem solving and an appreciation
                        of their human and cultural heritage.
                     
                     
                     At the Baccalaureate level, the Department provides courses which introduce students
                        to subdivisions within the discipline. At the Masters level, the Department emphasizes
                        specific and applied aspects of the subdivisions which prepare graduates to continue
                        the study of philosophy and enhance their intellectual lives. The focus of the Doctoral
                        program is training professional philosophers who can teach courses and contribute
                        to high-quality scholarly work in at least one of the subdivisions of philosophy.
                     
                     
                     Pluralism
                     
                     For several decades there has been a deep schism in the American philosophical community
                        between "continental philosophy" and "analytic philosophy." That this schism has been
                        detrimental to the discipline is now widely recognized, and the University of Memphis
                        Department of Philosophy, along with a few other philosophy departments around the
                        country, seeks to engender an appreciation of both traditions in our students. The
                        history of philosophy is an important component of our program because it serves as
                        the common language of the two traditions.
                     
                     
                     Diversity
                     
                     In addition to overcoming the divisions of these traditions, the University of Memphis
                        Department of Philosophy seeks to promote inclusiveness (in terms of race and gender)
                        in all facets of the Department. Because feminism and race theory are areas of philosophy
                        where the boundaries separating analytic and continental philosophy are regularly
                        crossed, we have found that our commitments to philosophical pluralism and to diversity
                        complement one another.
                     
                     
                     Adopting this kind of inclusive stance in which a plurality of philosophical methodologies
                        and styles are respected and encouraged is the centerpiece of the University of Memphis
                        program. It is evident in the curriculum, and in the research and scholarly activities
                        of the faculty. The high level of research productivity and the conscientious training
                        of students advance both the reputation of the Department and the vitality of the
                        profession.
                     
                     
                     Goals
                     
                     The goals of the Department include the following: continued development of the existing
                        degree programs, maintenance and enhancement of general education courses, maintenance
                        and enhancement of the national and international recognition of the faculty, service
                        to the profession and the community through sponsorship and contribution to public
                        programs and publications, and, above all, continued development and enhancement of
                        an inclusive environment in which all program participants can thrive.
                     
                     
                     The Department's achievements in cultivating an inclusive and pluralistic environment
                        constitute its uniqueness. Our success in this regard is recognized throughout the
                        global philosophical community, and other programs have attempted to emulate our practices
                        as a result. It is our hope that the students who complete our programs will spread
                        this mission to all other environments they inhabit.
