                        About Dr. Ferkin
                        
                        My research involves the study of animal behavior. Since I joined the faculty of the
                           University of Memphis in 1995, my research has determined aspects of how animals communicate
                           with one another, and how this affects their subsequent social and sexual interactions.
                           My students and I study the social and sexual behavior of animals from four different
                           levels of analysis, mechanism, development, function, and evolutionary history. We
                           have addressed questions regarding the role of olfactory communication in the expression
                           of social and sexual behavior in small mammals, such as voles. We have made many important
                           discoveries that have increased our understanding of the physiology, ontogeny, cognitive
                           functioning, adaptive significance and evolution and function of the behaviors that
                           support social and sexual interactions in terrestrial mammals. My laboratory has been
                           supported primarily through competitive grants from the National Science Foundation
                           and National Institutes of Health. To date, we have been awarded over $1.5 million
                           dollars from these granting agencies. My lab has also published 125 peer-reviewed
                           papers, in top-tier journals such as Nature, Animal Behaviour, Hormones and Behavior,
                           Behaviour, Physiology and Behavior, Ethology, Journal of Comparative Psychology, Animal
                           Cognition, and Behavioral Ecology. Our papers in Nature and Animal Cognition received
                           much recognition in the scientific and public arena; several articles were published
                           in journals and newspapers discussing our findings. I currently serve as an editor
                           for Animal Behaviour and for Current Zoology.I am committed to high quality science
                           training for undergraduate and graduate students. I feel strongly that teaching and
                           research are not dichotomous. One of my main goals as a researcher and teacher is
                           to stimulate students' thinking about the complexity and elegance of science, particularly
                           the study of animal behavior. I teach courses in Animal Behavior, Behavioral Ecology,
                           Animal Cognition, Communication, General Endocrinology, and Comparative Anatomy of
                           Vertebrates,
