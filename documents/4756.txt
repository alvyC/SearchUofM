		The University of Memphis Boosts Cybersecurity with Duo

				
			Posted by  Bambi Lange		
			
    
    

		
		Information Technology Services has partnered with Duo Security to provide Multi-factor Authentication for U of M computer account holders. Duo offers a method for you to protect your account by requiring a secondary means (or factor) of authentication in addition to your password. Duo is convenient because it allows you to leverage your phone and mobile devices as the second factor.
 
As cybersecurity tools have matured, bad actors have increasingly shifted from directly targeting computer systems to launching sophisticated phishing attacks against the people who access these systems. While simple password-based authentication has become increasingly vulnerable, Duo substantially reduces the threat of unauthorized access to your account. Use of Duo protects your sensitive personal information, as well as that of your colleagues and students, from illegitimate disclosure or alteration.
 
Who is Eligible?
 
All members of the University of Memphis community —  including faculty, staff, and students — are eligible to take advantage of Duo.
 
How Do I Enable Duo?
 
To enable Duo for your account, login to iAM and select “Duo Account Security.” You will then be guided through the process of registering your phones. Once you have enabled Duo, you will be prompted to authenticate with your second factor the next time you log in to any campus web resource.
 
How Do I Get Help?
 
Further information regarding Duo can be found at ( http://www.memphis.edu/its/security/duo.php ). For assistance, please contact the Service Desk at 901.678.8888.
 
Regards,
Robert

		ITS Strategic Planning

				
			Posted by  Bambi Lange		
			
    
    

		
		Each spring, Information Technology Systems (ITS) collects feedback from students, staff and faculty using the Techqual survey. This year that feedback will be supplemented by a review of our organizational effectiveness, and the results from both efforts will support this year’s strategic planning effort. Ben Bryant has agreed to assist with our review of organizational effectiveness.
 
Mr. Bryant, a founder of SCB Computer Technology in 1976, has over 40 years of experience in the IT industry and has a long history of supporting the University. He holds BBA and MS degrees from the UofM and has served on the UofM Board of Visitors since 1997. He was appointed Executive in Residence at the FedEx Institute of Technology in 2010 and continues to serve the University as Executive in Residence at the Crews Center for Entrepreneurship.
 
As part of this engagement, Mr. Bryant will confer with individuals throughout ITS and the University. We anticipate the review will be completed by June, 2016 and recommendations will be reviewed to identify opportunities that can be leveraged to increase operational efficiencies and effectiveness within ITS. Mr. Bryant can be reached at 901.678.1597.
 
Meetings with Ben Bryant will be coordinated as needed during the coming weeks. Please contact me with any questions about this process.
Regards,
Robert

		Ransomware

				
			Posted by  Bambi Lange		
			
    
    

		
		The ITS Security team would like to make the campus community aware of a new piece of malware, called “Locky”, that is actively being circulated online.  Locky is part of a new breed of malicious software called ransomware, as its primary purpose is to encrypt or “lock” a user’s files and force the individual to pay a ransom to regain access to their files.  This malware is also doubly dangerous as it not only encrypts all of a user’s files on their local computer, but can also infect files on any networked file share that the user may share with others.
Locky is currently being spread via email as an attached Word document.  When opened, the Word document will initially appear corrupt, but will prompt the user to enable macros in order to see the full content.  While macros are disabled in Word by default, clicking the prompt to enable macros will cause the computer to download and execute the malicious software that is responsible for encrypting all of the files.
Please use caution when opening any attachment received via email if it is unexpected, from a sender unknown to you, or the language or content is suspicious in any other way.  If you receive an attachment that you are unsure of, you may report the content to abuse@memphis.edu  for further analysis.  If you do open an attachment that appears to be suspicious or malicious, please contact the ITS Service Desk by phone at (901) 678-8888, via email at umtech@memphis.edu , or your LSP for further assistance.
For additional information regarding malware, phishing, and other online threats, please visit the ITS Security website at http://www.memphis.edu/its/security .

		Email Phishing Attempts

				
			Posted by  Bambi Lange		
			
    
    

		
		Sophisticated email phishing attempts are being conducted in an effort to compromise University accounts.  These emails may contain content such as a request to reactivate your account, an unexpected invoice for a service, or a notice of a false court hearing.  Please use caution when opening any email attachments or clicking any links within suspicious emails.
Information Technology Services (ITS) will never ask you for your username and password via email or over the phone.
If you receive an email message that has a suspicious link or attachment, or asks you for account details such as your username and password, you can report the message to ITS staff via email at  abuse@memphis.edu  or over the phone by calling the ITS Service Desk at (901) 678-8888.  If you mistakenly opened an attachment or provided your account details via email or to a non-UofM website, please contact the ITS Service Desk for further assistance.
Additional information regarding keeping your University account safe can be found at  http://www.memphis.edu/its/security /.

		Alert: Malicious Adobe Email Attachment Circulating On-Campus

				
			Posted by  Bambi Lange		
			
    
    

		
		On Tuesday, January 26th, 2016, a number of UofM users received a message purporting to be from the Adobe Creative Cloud service with a Subject: line of “Adobe Invoice”. The message contained an attachment called “invoice.doc”, that when opened, would attempt to connect to a remote server and install malicious software on the recipient’s computer.
The remote server has since been taken offline and ITS staff are working with units who may have had computers that were impacted by the malicious attachment. If you received one of the “Adobe Invoice” emails with the invoice.doc attachment, please delete the email message and do not attempt to open the attachment.
If you opened the attachment, please contact the ITS Service Desk by phone at (901) 678-8888 or via email at umtech@memphis.edu  or your LSP for further assistance.
For more information about IT security, please visit the ITS security website.

		Important Announcement: Change in Password Reset Process

				
			Posted by  Bambi Lange		
			
    
    

		
		Important Announcement: Change in Password Reset Process
In an effort to enhance security of passwords and protect University data, ITS will implement a change in its Password Reset service. Effective immediately, the ITS Service Desk (Tier 1) will no longer, administratively, change passwords.  All UofM affiliates (faculty, staff, students, alumni, former students, etc.) will be encouraged to visit the University’s self-service Identity Management website located at https://iam.memphis.edu .  Here, you can initialize your account, reset your password, retrieve your UUID and answer your security questions to regain access to your account.
 
In addition, remember these important tips to ensure your data is secure:

Never share your password with anyone. This includes a UofM employee, friend or relative.
Beware of phishing emails that attempt to lure you to malicious websites.
Watch for email notifications about your password changing. If you did not change your password, please contact the Service Desk immediately.
Never respond to an email request for your username and password, or any other request to “verify” your account.
