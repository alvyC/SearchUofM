                     Your participation makes a difference!  Your $25 gift might be all we need to complete
                        a major initiative.  Seeing our students and alumni support the University will help
                        encourage others to contribute also.  Additionally, our alumni participation figure
                        weighs into the U.S. News and World Report's annual ranking of national universities.
                     
                     
                     What is the Office of Development?
                     
                     The Office of Development raises funds for the University.  We develop relationships
                        alumni, parents, students, faculty/staff, and friends of the University, as well as
                        corporations and foundations.  As those individuals and groups become more engaged,
                        we present the University's needs and answer questions as they choose how they want
                        support the University.
                     
                     
                     Why does UofM need private money if it is a public University?
                     
                     Only some of the University's funding comes from tuition, fees, and state funding. 
                        The remaining must be donated from loyal alumni, friends, companies, foundations,
                        parents, and even students.
                     
                     
                     What is the difference between Common Cents and the FAM?
                     
                     Common Cents, the student giving program at the University of Memphis, enables you
                        to contribute to the University as a student. We want to help everyone understand
                        the important role our donors have in sustaining the University, and want you (our
                        future alumni!) to learn the importance of giving back. Your gift is tax-deductible
                        as allowed by law.
                     
                     
                     The FAM provides programming and services for current University of Memphis students
                        that will aid in developing stronger connections with the institution as well as with
                        its alumni. The FAM is a membership-based organization and carries an annual fee of
                        $20 for students.  The dues are not tax-deductible.
                     
                     
                     I already pay tuition, why should I give the UofM more money?
                     
                     Tuition and fees provide on a portion of the University's annual revenue.  As with
                        state funding, the University relies on donations to help fill the gaps where financial
                        support is needed but can't be provided by state funding and tuition and fees.
                     
                     
                     What will my gift of $5, $10, $20.15, or even $100 really do?
                     
                     All gifts make a difference.   Even gifts that may seem small to you will combine
                        with similar gifts from tens of thousands of other students, alumni, parents, and
                        friends of the University to create a large impact.  Many donors may have thought
                        their gifts were small, but when combined with other gifts, they were able to provide
                        a lot of support for the University of Memphis.
                     
                     
                     What is the Student Campaign, and why should I give?
                     
                     Led by the Common Cents Philanthropy Council, our Student Campaign spreads the awareness
                        of the importance of your financial contributions to the University.  We ask students
                        support the University with a gift that is comfortable for them: $5, $10, $20, $25,
                        $50, $100.  We hope that every student leaves the university knowing their gifts,
                        of any size, truly make an impact.
                     
                     
                     Someday, we hope to reach 100% student body participation every year.  What an impact
                        we could make if every student contributed to the University each year! You can contribute
                        to your school or college, or whatever fund interests you.
