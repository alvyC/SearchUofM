                     Admission to the Fogelman College's Ph.D. program is based on:
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           
                            a thorough review of the qualifications of the applicant,
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                            space availability in the program, and
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                            fit between the Department program objectives and the applicant's objectives.
                           
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     The Academic Program Admissions Committee makes Ph.D. admission decision recommendations
                        in conjunction with the Associate Dean for Academic Programs to the Vice Provost for
                        Graduate Studies . The applicant's entire academic record is reviewed, including GMAT or GRE score,
                        undergraduate and graduate grades, and three letters of recommendation. Also, a resume
                        and a statement of personal career objectives must be submitted, and a personal interview
                        is normally required. An initial review is based upon an examination of exam score
                        and grade point average of previous work. The higher your exam score, the higher your
                        chances of being accepted and being considered for a departmental scholarship. The
                        average exam score for admitted applicants has been above 600 GMAT and 1200 GRE for
                        the past three years.  The final admission decision recommendation is based on the
                        above criteria and graduate faculty evaluation of the applicant's potential for success
                        in a doctoral program in business administration.
                     
                     
                     For students without a master's degree, equivalent scores based on undergraduate GPA
                        are required, and students may be admitted initially to the graduate master's program.

                        is best not wait until the deadline.
