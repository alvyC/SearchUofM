                     UofM's Hooks Institute Selects Stokely: A Life as 2014 National Book Award Winner
                     
                     
                     October 1, 2015 - The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University
                        of Memphis has selected Stokely: A Life by Peniel E. Joseph as the winner of its National Book Award for 2014. Honorable
                        mention goes to A World More Concrete: Real Estate and The Remaking of Jim Crow South Florida by N.D. B. Connolly. The award recognizes publications that best advance an understanding
                        of the American civil rights movement and its legacy.
                     
                     
                     Joseph's carefully researched and beautifully written biography of Stokely Carmichael
                        captures his contributions to the civil rights movement. This book places Carmichael,
                        a political strategist, civil rights activist and intellectual and community organizer
                        who became a Black Panther, alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X as
                        part of a revolutionary triumvirate who dominated the world stage of the 1960s.
                     
                     
                     Carmichael (Kwame Ture) was the only one of the three who lived to see the age of
                        40. He was a child of Caribbean immigrants, educated at one of the best public high
                        schools in New York and Howard University, and mentored by King and Fannie Lou Hamer.
                        He marched with King, campaigning for voting rights, and then founded the first Black
                        Panther Party in Mississippi. Acknowledging that Carmichael's life and legacy have
                        faded in collective memory, Joseph describes his biography as an act of recovery of
                        an under-told story that enriches the understanding of the civil rights movement.
                     
                     
                     The Hooks Institute received more than 20 nominations for the Book Award, primarily
                        from university presses across the United States. In addition to Stokely (Basic Civitas),
                        the other four finalists were: N.D. B. Connolly, A World More Concrete: Real Estate
                        and The Remaking of Jim Crow South Florida (University of Chicago Press); Jeffrey

                     The five judges were Dr. Aram Goudsouzian, professor and chair of history at the University

                     In 1996, University of Memphis officials received approval from the Tennessee Board
