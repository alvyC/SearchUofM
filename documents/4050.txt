                     Grades used to postpone or suspend course completion include "I" (incomplete), "IP"
                        (in progress), and "W" (withdrawn).
                     
                     
                     Independent studies or problems courses, directed readings, student teaching, workshops,
                        practica, internships, theses, and dissertations should be graded "A-F, IP" or "S","U",
                        IP." A grade of "S,""U," or "IP," does not carry any quality points and is not included
                        in computing GPA.
                     
                     
                     Incomplete: The grade "I" (Incomplete) may be assigned by the faculty member in any course other
                        than those with “IP” grading in which the student is unable to complete the work due
                        to extraordinary events beyond the individual's control that are acceptable to the
                        faculty member. The "I" may not be used to extend the term for students who complete
                        the course with an unsatisfactory grade. Unless the student completes the requirements
                        for removal of the "I" within 90 days from the end of the semester or summer session
                        in which it was received (see University Calendar), the "I" will change to an "F,"
                        whether or not the student is enrolled. The faculty member may grant up to a 45-day
                        extension if sufficient extenuating circumstances exist. At the end of the extension
                        period, the "I" grade will automatically revert to "F" if the student has not completed
                        the requirements. The student will be certified for graduation only when all requirements
                        are met, including the removal of "I" grades. If a student has an "I" in a course
                        necessary to fulfill degree requirements in the semester in which he or she expects
                        to graduate, the certification process and graduation will automatically be deferred
                        to the next term.
                     
                     
                     In Progress: In some courses with "IP" (In Progress) grading, faculty members may assign "IP"
                        to extend the time permitted for the completion of research or course requirements.
                        A student awarded an "IP" grade must re-enroll in the course for the same number of hours to complete the work. Students must continuously re-enroll in thesis
                        or dissertation courses but the hours may vary. The final grade will be submitted
                        by the faculty member at the end of the term in which the work is completed.
                     
                     
                     Thesis/Dissertation Grading: The use of S, U, IP grading for theses and dissertations is different from its use
                        for other courses. The grade of “S” is ONLY awarded when the student successfully
                        defends the thesis or dissertation; the grade of “U” is awarded ONLY when the student
                        fails to defend successfully. Otherwise, the grade of “IP” is awarded to indicate
                        that the student is progressing in a timely manner. Students must enroll for at least
                        1 thesis or dissertation hour for each semester (except for summer sessions) that
                        they are working on the thesis or dissertation.
                     
                     
                     Grade Point Average: Graduate students must maintain a minimum of a 3.0 GPA ("B"). Grades of "D" and "F"
                        will not apply toward any graduate degree, but will be computed in the GPA. No more
                        than 7 hours of "C-," "C" or "C+" will be applied towards meeting degree requirements.
                        Grades earned at another university will not be computed in the cumulative GPA. Grades
                        in courses that are older than the time limitation for degree will be shown on the
                        transcript but will not be included in the computation of the GPA used for graduation.
                        Only courses that have been validated will count toward the degree (see below for
                        validation policy). The overall GPA required for graduation, computed on all graduate
                        level courses completed whether or not they are listed on the candidacy form, must
                        also be a minimum of 3.0.
                     
                     
                     Repetition of Courses: A graduate student may repeat a course to earn a higher grade only if the earned
                        grade was a "U" or lower than a "B" (3.0). No course may be repeated more than once to improve the grade. Only the grade earned in the second attempt will be included in the computation of
                        the cumulative grade point average. A maximum of two courses may be repeated during
                        the student's total graduate career to improve a grade. However, if a student advances
                        to a doctoral program and wishes to repeat a third course at the doctoral level, the
                        student must seek approval from the college director of graduate studies. Students
                        should always check with their advisors before enrolling in a course a second time.
                     
                     
                     Grade Changes: Grades properly issued in a course by the faculty member of record will not be altered
                        except when an error was made in computation or reporting or as a result of a formal
                        grade appeal. A grade other than "I" or "IP" may not be changed as a result of additional
