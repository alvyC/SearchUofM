                     These are exciting times for the School of Accountancy at the Fogelman College of
                        Business and Economics at the University of Memphis. Both are fully accredited by
                        AACSB International, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. We
                        offer high-quality undergraduate and graduate programs in accounting, experienced
                        teaching-oriented faculty, a strong placement record, and a focus on graduating accountants
                        ready for the workplace. We are dedicated to ensuring our programs are accessible
                        to those from a variety of backgrounds. We offer undergraduate students an outstanding
                        Bachelor's program, as well as a minor in accounting. On the graduate level, we offer
                        an MS in Accounting.
                     
                     
                     There are several notable characteristics of our programs. First, in addition to meeting
                        the current Tennessee credit-hour requirements, we have included in our MS program
                        courses aligned with the topics on the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination,
                        the premier certification for accountants. As a result, our graduates have a high
                        success rate on this exam. Second, an important aspect of our program is its focus
                        on ethics. Each student must complete an ethics course, and most of our courses include
                        components about business ethics. Third, the School offers working professionals the
                        flexibility to take online, evening, and accelerated summer courses that accommodate
                        busy schedules. Importantly, our students are taught by quality, student-focused faculty
                        trained in some of the top PhD and law programs in the nation. Our faculty regularly
                        publish cutting-edge research, but also emphasize building students' analytical, writing,
                        and speaking skills while being readily accessible to students.
                     
                     
                     Our programs are challenging, requiring hard work and commitment by our students.
                        Knowing our high standards, recruiters have helped us to achieve near-100% placement
                        rate among our MS students prior to graduation. All of the Big-4 and regional accounting
                        firms and many Fortune 500 companies recruit our graduates. Our Beta Alpha Psi chapter
                        is quite active in helping students build close relationships with national recruiters.
                        Our Professional Development Center readies students for professional accounting careers.
                     
                     
                     You will find that our combination of caring faculty, quality teaching, flexible learning
                        opportunities, and successful placement is inimitable among accounting programs. If
                        you seek to begin a career in accounting or taxation or to enhance your expertise
                        as a practicing accountant, attorney, or financial planner, it will be worth your
                        time to learn more about our programs to begin or further your career.
