                     Welcome to the College of Communication and Fine Arts!
                     
                     Welcome to the College of Communication and Fine Arts. Here you will find an environment
                        that nurtures your abilities, develops your skills, and challenges you to do your
                        very best.
                     
                     
                     Our faculty members are active researchers whose ideas and discoveries find their
                        way back into the classroom to enrich their instruction. They exhibit, publish, and
                        perform nationally and internationally. Many of them are deeply engaged with the community,
                        striving to make a difference. From urban art to sustainable design projects to helping
                        non-profits develop a public relations strategy to working with health professionals
                        to improve their communication skills, our faculty and students care about the world
                        around them.
                     
                     
                     Whether you dream of being in the visual or performing arts, design or architecture,
                        making films, or making an impact in the fields of communication, journalism or strategic
                        media, there is a pathway for you here and dedicated faculty to guide you. I invite
                        you to explore the diverse areas of study in the College by perusing the departmental
                        websites. Here you will see and hear student testimonials, learn what graduates are
                        doing in their chosen professions, and read about faculty backgrounds and interests.
                     
                     
                     Better yet, come visit us in person. Sit in on a class, enjoy a performance, or visit
                        the Art Museum. Experience for yourself the energy and creativity that is CCFA's signature
                        strength.
