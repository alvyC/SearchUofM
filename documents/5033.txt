On September 10, 1912, President Seymour A. Mynders along with 17 faculty members and over 200 students made history with the dedication of the West Tennessee Normal School. Over 100 years later, well over 150,000 alumni have proven that our institution is anything but “normal.”
The Alumni Association has established the Guild of 1912 as a way to honor those that have come before us and to provide programs and services to those that are paving the way for the future. Your sustaining monthly gift of $19.12 will directly support innovative new programming and annual traditions for Alumni Association and Future Alumni of Memphis members. Through the creation of career services, networking and coaching opportunities and more, we can continue to meet the needs of our alumni and friends. Your gift makes a lasting impact on your alma mater. 
As a member of this elite group, you will receive recognition for your unwavering support at incremental gift levels. The first gift is a commemorative brick from Richardson Towers!*
*Bricks must be picked up at the Alumni Center located at 635 Normal Street, Memphis, TN.
