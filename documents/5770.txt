                     wind ensemble
                     
                     With a goal of being one of the finest ensembles of its kind, the University of Memphis
                        Wind Ensemble is comprised of the most exceptional graduate and undergraduate instrumentalists
                        attending the Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music. The ensemble is dedicated to deliver
                        artistic performances that are both eloquent and meticulously prepared. A significant
                        amount of attention is placed on the innovative programming process, an approach that
                        exemplifies the uniqueness of the Memphis area by highlighting the rich diversity
                        of a distinctive community. The quest of the University of Memphis Wind Ensemble is
                        to achieve the highest degree of professionalism possible, and to bring its audiences
                        the finest artistic repertoire regardless of the period, or style. The Wind Ensemble
                        is conducted by Dr. Albert Nguyen , director of bands and area coordinator for wind studies.
                     
                     
                     Symphonic Band
                     
                     The Symphonic Band performs the masterwork grade five and six wind literature designed
                        for the rich sonorities of an expanded instrumentation. The Symphonic Band pursues
                        excellence in rehearsal and performance, and provides its audiences a varied repertoire
                        from all musical periods, cultures and styles. Auditions are held each semester and
                        participants receive one hour of undergraduate credit. The Symphonic Band rehearses
                        two days per week each semester.
                     
                     
                     University Band
                     
                     The University Band is conducted by band graduate assistants. This group performs
                        a wide range of literature including standard band literature, transcriptions and
                        new music. Students are not required to audition for this band, which meets one day
                        per week. Participants, who are mostly non-music majors, receive one hour of undergraduate
                        credit. For more information, contact the band office at 901.678.2263.
                     
                     
                     Mighty Sound of the South
                     
                     The Mighty Sound of the South Marching Band is a group of 220 to 240 members. They
                        perform for all home games and two away games each fall. Membership is gained upon
                        the satisfactory completion of a playing audition, which may be scheduled by calling
                        the band office. Talent based scholarships are available by audition to all members.
                        School instruments are available for a rental fee of $25.00 per semester. There is
                        no uniform rental fee. When the band travels, the University pays for bus transportation
                        and each student is given a meal allowance. When the band stays overnight, the University
                        pays the hotel/motel accommodations. Marching band members receive two hours academic
                        credit for the fall semester. Band Camp is usually held two weeks before classes begin
                        for the fall semester. Rehearsals are held on campus and out of country/out of state
                        students are housed in dormitories on campus during camp. The marching band performs
                        three different halftime shows each fall in addition to the traditional pre-game show.
                        All University of Memphis home games are played at the Liberty Bowl Stadium.
