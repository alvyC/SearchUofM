                     the Memphis way
                     
                     Every year new recruits arrive on campus. Many have left their entire support systems
                        back home and moved to Memphis to become a Tiger. We couldn't be more proud to have
                        you here and will do everything to help you feel supported and at home. Just like
                        the city of Memphis, our University is as down home and friendly as it gets, while
                        also being as cutting-edge as anything in the world. We are the University that is
                        driven to do things our way. To be original. Think differently. You didn't come here
                        just to compete. Or just to learn. You came to experience. Solve. Create. Express,
                        explore and to lead. That's what Memphis does . We're Driven by Doing.
