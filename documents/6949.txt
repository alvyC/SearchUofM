                     Chemistry Permit Requests
                     
                     This permit request is not for classes offered through the Regents Online Degree Program
                        ( RODP , section R50) or for courses in subjects other than CHEM. Please follow the instructions
                        in the Class Schedule Listing to obtain such permits.
                     
                     
                      PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE YOU FILL OUT THE PERMIT REQUEST 
                     
                     If you encounter a problem when attempting to register for a chemistry course, you
                        may need to submit a permit request form. Note that pre-requisites for CHEM courses
                        are listed in the undergraduate catalog and must be completed with a grade of C- or better before the course you wish to
                        enrol in starts.
                     
                     
                     Research courses (CHEM 4901, 4902, 4903), Teaching (CHEM 4916), and Internship (CHEM 4918)
                        require prior approval by an appropriate sponsor. Follow the links for more information
                        and make arrangements with a sponsor of your choice. Complete the appropriate prospectus
                        and send it to pbridson@memphis.edu or fax to 901-678-3447. Do not submit a separate
                        permit request form.
                     
                     
                     The following are reasons for submitting the permit request form and further instructions:
                     
                     
                        
                        A course equivalent to the pre-requisite has been accepted by the University of Memphis
                           but with a different course number. Submit the permit request form .
                        
                        
                        The pre-requisite has been completed at another college, but UofM has not yet received
                           the transcript. Submit the permit request form with a copy of your unoffical transcript.
                        
                        
                        You will complete the pre-requisite course at another college. Submit the permit request form and, if your official transcript has not been processed by UofM at least 10 days
                           before the course starts, send a copy of your unoffical transcript to pbridson@memphis.edu,
                           fax to 901-678-3447, or bring to the Chemistry Department office, SM 210. Failure
                           to comply will result in your registration being cancelled at the beginning of the
                           semester.
