                     The Master of Arts Degree Program
                     
                     The Master of Arts program of study in history prepares students for a variety of
                        careers. Students who regard the M.A. as a terminal degree usually elect to fulfill
                        degree requirements by completing 33 hours of coursework (11 3-hour graduate-level
                        courses) without writing a thesis. Many of these students go on to teaching positions
                        on the secondary and community college levels; a lesser number enter government service;
                        and some secure specialized positions in business, industry, and journalism.
                     
                     
                     Those students who want to pursue a career as a university faculty member or intend
                        to work in some other field involving historical research and writing should look
                        upon the M.A. program as preparation for a Ph.D. program. We recommend that such students
                        write a master's thesis.
