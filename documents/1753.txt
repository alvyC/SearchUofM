                     Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world/Leave all thoughts of the
                        world you knew before/Let your soul take you where you long to be... The most successful
                        Broadway musical of all time comes to our stage for only eight performances to celebrate
                        the 100th Birthday of The University of Memphis. Phantom is a fantastic extravagance
                        of soaring ballads and sensational stage effects. A masked figure lurks beneath the
                        catacombs of the Paris Opera House, exercising a reign of terror while he pursues
                        an innocent young soprano. A love story. A horror story. A spectacle like no other.
