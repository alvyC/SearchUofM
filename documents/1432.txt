                     Tiger Funds
                     
                     A Tiger Funds account works like a debit card. It is a unique money management system
                        activated by your Campus Card that is available to all students, faculty, and staff.
                        Log in to your account (click Your Campus Card above) to see specifics about your
                        account, including balance and transaction history,Â meal plan status (if applicable),
                        and Tiger Funds information.
                     
                     
                     Once you have made a deposit into your personal Tiger Funds account, you simply present
                        your Campus Card to pay for meals at campus dining locations or to purchase books,
                        supplies, and personal items at the University Store.
                     
                     
                     You can also use your Campus Card in copier machines and for services at the Health
                        Center and the Bursar's Office.
                     
                     
                     How does it work?
                     
                     It is simple to activate your Tiger Funds account. Your Campus Card is already encoded
                        to provide access to University events and activities. When you make a minimum deposit
                        of $10 to your personal Tiger Funds account, your Campus Card becomes your Tiger Funds
                        card as well. Your daily transaction limit cannot exceed $500. Tiger Funds may not
                        be used to purchase gift cards.
                     
                     
                     Each time you make a purchase, your Campus Card is swiped through a card reader and
                        the amount of the purchase is automatically deducted from the balance in your Tiger
                        Funds account. Your remaining balance is indicated on your receipt after each transaction
                        so you will always know how much money remains in your account.
                     
                     
                     You can deposit money to your Tiger Funds account in the following ways:

                     Tiger Funds are maintained separately from Dining Dollars, meal plan accounts and
                        Flex Bucks, which are also accessed by your Campus Card. Meal plan accounts are administered
                        by the University's food service vendor. The policies and procedures of the meal plan
                        accounts are those of the vendor and not those of the University of Memphis.
                     
                     
                     What are the advantages of Tiger Funds?
                     
                     It gives you ready access to all food services locations that offer a variety of foodÂ Â Â Â Â 
                        choices, from early morning breakfasts to late night snacks. It offers you purchase
                        privileges without cash, for the great selection of books, supplies, gifts, and personal
                        items at the University Store. Use your Campus Card to make copies at the McWherter
                        Library, Law Library, the Speech and Hearing Center, and the Lambuth campus Library.
                        Account balances remain available as long as you have an active relationship with
                        theÂ Â Â Â Â  University. Once you establish your Tiger Funds account, there is little
                        or need to carry cashÂ or to write checks for University meals, supplies, or services.
                     
                     
                     How do I request a refund of the remaining balance on my Tiger Funds account?
                     
                     Refund requestsÂ from the Tiger Funds account must be submitted in person to the Bursar's
                        Office, 115 Wilder Tower. Lambuth students may request a refund at the Business Service
                        Center on the Lambuth campus in 109 Varnell-Jones Hall.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        A $5 processingÂ fee will be deducted from the available balance in the account prior
                           to the refund.
                        
                        
                        Any amounts thatÂ are owed to the University will be deducted from the available balance
                           in the account prior to the processing of a refund.
                        
                        
                        The refund willÂ be processed to the eRefund account through TigerXpress.
                        
                        If no payment profile exists in TigerXpress, a check will be mailed to theÂ permanent
                           address on file with the University.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Tiger Funds accounts that remain inactive for an extended period of time are subject
                        to automatic refund processing and the previous conditions apply.
