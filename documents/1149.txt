	   Students are more likely to make a lasting connection to their campus through their non-academic involvement on campus. Therefore, our constituent groups are a way for alumni to reconnect with fellow Tigers with shared experiences.


Band Alumni Chapter : Former members of the Mighty Sound of the South
Half Century Club : Alumni that graduated 50 years ago or more
Hispanic Alumni : Tigers with a Hispanic heritage or interest

Lambuth Alumni Chapter : Graduates of Lambuth University
Luther C. McClellan Alumni Chapter : Tigers with an African American heritage; Luther C. McClellan was the first African American to graduate from Memphis State University in 1962.
Memphis Pom : Former team members of Memphis Pom
UMAR : University of Memphis Association of Retirees
Young Alumni : Alumni that graduated within the last five years


Each chapter hosts events throughout the year in order to honor
outstanding alumni, reconnect with friends, recruit students, raise money for scholarships, or give back to
the community. Show your support by attending an event!
Constituent groups rely on the support of alumni and friends to plan
events and advance the chapter toward achieving its goals. You can help
by volunteering to serve on a governing board or by attending meetings
and sharing your ideas. To learn more, select a chapter name to the left
and contact the Alumni Coordinator.
