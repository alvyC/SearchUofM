                     Purchasing Card Program
                     
                     The University of Memphis Purchasing Card Program has been established to provide
                        University employees with a convenient means to make legitimate business purchases
                        and, at the same time, reduce the costs associated with initiating and paying for
                        those purchases. Use of the Purchasing Card for small dollar purchases less than $5,000
                        consolidates paperwork and helps facilitate vendor payment. The VISA cards are issued
                        by Regions Bank.
