                                 By choosing to attend the University of Memphis, each student accepts responsibility
                                    for promoting the University community's welfare by adhering to the Code of Student
                                    Rights and Responsibilities and all other University of Memphis policies. At the University
                                    of Memphis, some actions cannot be tolerated because they seriously interfere with
                                    the basic purposes and processes of an academic community or with the rights afforded
                                    others. By formulating the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, the University
                                    of Memphis reaffirms the principle of student freedom coupled with personal responsibility
                                    and accountability for individual actions and the consequences of those actions.
