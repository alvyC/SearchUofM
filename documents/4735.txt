                        how to protect yourself.
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     Compromised Account - What's a compromised account? A hacked or compromised account is unauthorized use of an account by someone other
                        than the account owner. Remember, ITS will never ask for your password via email or
                        phone.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Digital Certificates An SSL certificate is a signed electronic guarantee that verifies the authenticity
                        of a particular server. It is used for providing web pages through an encrypted connection. 
                        This service includes processing, ordering, renewal monitoring and notification.
                     
                     
                     iAM (Account self Service) The iAM web service provides users the ability to self-service several account functions
                        such as password reset, email routing and vanity email address selection.
                     
                     
                     iAM (Duo Account Security) Duo Account Security or two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security
                        to your online accounts. Verifying your identity using a second factor (like your
                        phone or other mobile device) prevents anyone but you from logging in, even if they
                        know your password.
                     
                     
                     Password - How to change your UofM password
                     
                     Your password, in association with your Universal User ID (UUID), gives you access
                        to all of the University's computing resources and online services. This account password
                        should be unique from every other password you use. The University requires all UUID
                        passwords to be changed every 6 months.
                     
                     Report a Technology Incident or Report Internet/Security Abuse
