                     A.R.T.S.
                     
                     The University of Memphis A.R.T.S. (art research travel studies) is an organization
                        founded by and composed of undergraduate and graduate students from the Department
                        of Art and across the University. The main goal/purpose of this organization is to
                        promote the appreciation enjoyment and understanding of all forms of art through trips
                        to the major art centers throughout the country and the world. We encourage anyone
                        with an interest in art to participate in this organization, whatever you major may
                        be. A.R.T.S. is for those graduate and undergraduate students who hold a 2.0 or higher
                        GPA.
                     
                     
                     Each year A.R.T.S. sponsors an organized trip to see original works of art, visit
                        artist studios, participate in workshops; tour design firms, and learns from professionals
                        in all media. We visit major museums to see standing collections, special exhibitions,
                        and even make arrangements to visit private study rooms to view works under conservation
                        and restoration. Past trips have included places such as: Washington D.C., Chicago,
                        New York City, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona, Rome, Greece, Brussels, Prague and Vienna.
                     
                     
                     To raise funds for these trips, students hold an annual art auction where the public
                        may bid on works by students, faculty and area artists. These events make the trips
                        surprisingly affordable. In the twelve years we have been making these trips, the
                        cost has never been more than $700 for trips within the U.S. and $1600 for Europe,
                        which includes airfare five to eight nights in a three to four star hotel.
                     
                     
                     Considering all that is available through this organization, the dues are small –
                        only fifteen dollars per year. If you are interested in participating in A.R.T.S.
                        please contact the organizations faculty advisor, David Horan at 901.678.2925 or dhoran@memphis.edu.
