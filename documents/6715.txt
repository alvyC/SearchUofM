                        Frances concentrates on strategic decision making. This interest has led to research
                           on the industry environment, and the nature of information, knowledge and wisdom for
                           organizations.
                        
                        
                        Recent work has incorporated complexity theory to describe and depict the nonlinearities
                           of modern decisionmaking environments.
