                     Introductory programming courses are typically required for undergraduate students
                        majoring in Information Systems. Instructors use different approaches to teaching
                        this course: some lecturing and assigning programming exercises, others only assigning
                        programming exercises without lectures. This research compares the effects of these
                        two teaching approaches on learning performance by collecting data from two sections
                        of an introductory programming course in an urban public university. One section used
                        lectures and assignments while the other used assignments only. Data analysis included
                        tests within each dataset, tests across the two datasets, and tests of a simple model
                        over the combined dataset. Results indicated that both approaches are effective, but
                        the exercises-only approach is more effective than lectures combined with exercises.
                        Further analysis indicated that students; current programming skills, prior programming
                        experience, and grade expectations are significant antecedents of learning performance
                        in the course. Results support the conclusion suggesting that when teaching introductory
                        programming courses, instructors may want to consider choosing the student-centered
                        active learning over the traditional lecture format in order to improve students&apos;
                        learning performance. This study contributes to the improvement of teaching and learning
                        effectiveness as well as efficiency of introductory programming classes to the benefit
                        of instructors and students, alike.
