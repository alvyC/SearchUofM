        Hal & Teresa Freeman Nursing Scholarship for Veterans
Hal spent seven years in the US Navy aboard the USS Woodrow Wilson (SSBN 624 Gold) nuclear submarine deployed on twenty-two patrols.  He currently serves as the Veteran Liaison for the U of M Lambuth campus where he talks with veterans daily and knows the struggles they have continuing their education and starting a new life after their military service is done.
Teresa has been a registered nurse for thirty years and is currently the Assistant CNO at JMCGH.  She is keenly aware of the critical need for more qualified nurses to enter the workforce. 
We have truly been blessed in both our personal and professional lives, so two years ago, we decided to endow a scholarship that spoke to our hearts.  A scholarship that combines both of our careers and our passions.  All donations will directly benefit veterans who want to attend nursing school.
One of our dreams for higher education is that every veteran student or dependent will not have to borrow money to go to nursing school. With the nationwide shortage of nurses and the abundance of veterans that want to enter the workforce after serving our country, we can help fulfill those dreams by supplying needed school funding.  So many times we have witnessed the effects of a student not having the funds to attend school and receive the education that they had dreamed of. We want to bridge some of the fund gaps student veterans need and endow this scholarship so that many students may live the dream of becoming a nurse.
