                     St. Jude Cancer Education for Children Program
                     
                     The St. Jude Cancer Education for Children Program ("Cure4Kids for Kids") aims to
                        become the leading source of cancer education for students in Kindergarten thru 12th
                        grades. This multilingual program helps school children, their parents and teachers
                        understand the basic science and treatment of cancer. Through the use of age-appropriate
                        content, the program focuses on three main objectives: 1) educating students, parents,
                        teachers and communities about cancer and dispelling common misconceptions; 2) promoting
                        healthy lifestyle choices in children that can help them reduce the risk of developing
                        cancer as adults; and 3) increasing interest in science and scientific careers.
                     
                     
                     Three children's books, each written at a grade 3-5 reading level, are the foundation
                        of the Cure4Kids for Kids curriculum. With a combination of cartoon-like graphics
                        and real photographs, What Are Cells? , What Is  Cancer? , and What Is Healthy Living? explain that cells, the basic units of life, grow and divide in a controlled way
                        to replace old cells and help things grow. Cancer then can be understood as a disease
                        of unhealthy cells  that grow out of control. Healthy living and cancer prevention
                        are discussed as healthy behaviors than can help prevent and protect cells from damage
                        that would cause them to become unhealthy cancer cells. An interactive website extends
                        the experience beyond the classroom so students can continue to learn about cancer
                        and healthy living wherever they go ( Cure4Kids.org/kids ). For teacher resources for this program visit St. Jude Cure4Kids for Teachers ( cure4kids.org/teachers ).
