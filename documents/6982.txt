                        My research involves areas of inorganic, organometallic, bioinorganic chemistry and
                              chemical biology, with particular interest in the design and engineering of models
                              for the oxygen-evolving center in photosystem II, through either synthetic methods
                              using organic ligands or biosynthetic approach using small, stable and well-characterized
                              proteins.
