                        per term, for a maximum of four credit hours per course and a maximum of four terms
                        per academic year. These employees may use one waiver in each of the Fall and Spring
                        terms and up to two waivers in the summer, in separate parts of the summer term. The
                        waiver applies to tuition, program services fees, online course fees and RODP fees.
                        The student remains responsible for payment of all other fees, and the submission
                        of the certified fee waiver form by the appropriate fee payment deadline each semester
                        to avoid deletion of classes. The employment certification on the form should not
                        be any earlier than July 1 for Fall, December 1 for Spring and April 15 for Summer.
                     
                     
                     Enrollment under this program is on a space-available basis only. Therefore, participants
                        may not register before the specific deadline for each semester. See the Bursar's Office Calendar for dates. Participants who register during a Late Registration period WILL BE ASSESSED
                        a Late Registration Fee of $100 not covered by the fee waiver program.
                     
                     
                     After course selection, participants must complete the enrollment fee satisfaction
                        process by submitting approved fee waiver forms.
