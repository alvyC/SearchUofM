                           your portfolio, your committee chair must review and approve the content. Please give
                           your chair adequate time for this review process. Once approved, the portfolio must
                           be submitted to the committee at least two weeks prior to your defense date.

                           program advisor will put you on the schedule.
                        
                        
                         Portfolio dates will be posted each semester on the HIAD web site. You should be
                           prepared to defend your portfolio around mid-term of the semester you plan to graduate.
                           (fall or spring semesters)
                        
                        
                        Email announcement of portfolio defense to all HIAD faculty members.

                     Examples of items that could be included in the portfolio are:
                     
                      1. Evidence of classroom experience      papers      projects      summaries of activities      annotated bibliography 2. Applications of program learning in a work related experience    curriculum/ training materials    workshops planned and/or attended    programs planned    committee work These items must appear in every portfolio:
                     
                     1. An up-to-date resume
                     
                     2. An approved program of studies
                     
                     3. Table (matrix) that indicates the courses and competencies
                     
                     4. An artifact (paper, project report, video, photograph) documenting each competency.
                        If possible, use the graded paper (including faculty comments). If you have a revised
                        or updated version, you may include both.
                     
                     
                     In addition:
                     
                     
                        
                        Each item included in your portfolio must be dated
                        
                        If the item submitted as evidence is course related, the course number must be included
                           and the graded version must be submitted
                        
                        
                        Time, place, and nature of the activity from which the artifact derives must be clear
                        
                        Submit the artifact that is best evidence. For example, a committee report listing
                           you as a member is better than an internship log page claiming participation
                        
                        
                        A written reflection should be prepared to accompany each artifact.
                        
                        The student must show in the reflection the relationship that exists between the artifact
                           and the competency.
                        
                        
                        In the reflection you may give examples from up to three courses to demonstrate you
                           have met the compentency.
                        
                        
                        In the reflection, compare and contrast your experience with theories you studied
                           in your masters classes.
                        
                        
                        At your portfolio defense, prepare to talk about the following:
                        
                     
                     
                     1. Look back across the materials in your portfolio and reflect on the process and
                        progress you have made towards becoming a competent educational leader. Take a holistic
                        look at your growth.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        What successes can you describe?
                        
                        Where did you miss the mark?
                        
                        What did you learn?
                        
                        How has your experience resulted in the improvement of your leadership skills?
                        
                     
                     
                     2. During the final presentation of your portfolio to the faculty, you will be asked
                        to reflect on your professional growth. Focus on what you have accomplished and how
                        you know you have expanded your abilities in these areas. Develop a strategy for your
                        future to continue to hone your leadership skills.

                     The portfolio must be submitted in an electronic format. We recommend a program called
                        Weebly. This is a free website builder that can be accessed with your browser at http://www.weebly.com /. Additionally, the links below provide a tutorial to assist in developing your portfolio.
                        Within the tutorial you will find a sample portfolio from a former student who used
                        Weebly.
