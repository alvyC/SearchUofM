                        award Graduate Assistantships. Auditions are scheduled by applying to the School of
                        Music through Acceptd . Graduate applicants audition for Performance, Conducting, Pedagogy, and Jazz. Live
                        auditions are highly preferred. The School of Music will accept non-edited video recorded
                        auditions from international students who reside outside the United States. The preferred
                        deadline for recorded audition submission from international students is December

                        listed in Audition Requirements. The Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music reserves the
                        right to require a live audition on campus if necessary.
