                     STUDENT CLASS GIFT
                     
                     Many thanks to the class of 2013 who joined together and continued the strong tradition
                        of philanthropy. As the first class that experienced Memphis Law with all three years
                        in the downtown location, they have truly made their mark. Those who made a gift of
                        $50 or more were recognized with their name on the wall in the student lounge.
                     
                     
                     The 2014 committee members are:

                     Now it's time for the Class of 2014 to make their mark too!
                     
                     Benefits
                     
                     Recognition. Each Class of 2014 member who makes a gift by April 4, 2014, will be
                        recognized in the Commencement Program, a piece of memorabilia that is sure to be
                        saved by all of us. We will also list each member on this web page, so be sure to
                        check it out to see who has made a donation.
                     
                     
                     Make your mark. More good news. Those members of the Class of 2014 who make a 2 year
                        pledge of at least $50 will have the opportunity to have his or her name inscribed
                        on the wall in the Student Lounge.
                     
                     
                     We are continuing the tradition. Our hope is that each 3L class will follow our lead
                        and continue to award a class scholarship for an incoming student and be inspired
                        to have their name on the wall when they graduate.
