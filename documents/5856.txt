                        Student Poster at the annual conference of the American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE)
                        held in Atlanta, GA in April. Jessica competed against masters and doctoral students
                        from Egyptology programs across the United States. Her poster topic, which is also
                        the subject of her M.A. thesis, focused on the relationship between minor demons in
                        the Book of the Dead known as gate guardians and Ammit (the part crocodile, lion,
                        hippopotamus demon named "The Devourer") in the "Weighing of the Heart" scene. Congratulations,
                        Jess!

                     We are proud to announce the success of our students at the University of Memphis
                     Annual Student Research Forum. Second-year masters students Carolina Quintana and
                     Jessica Johnson presented a poster on their research on an ancestor bust amulet from
                     the IEAA's ancient Egyptian collection. They were awarded first place in the Fine
                     and Liberal Arts division.
                     
                     ARCE and the University of Memphis Research Forum accept poster proposals every year,
                        so we hope to make the successes of our students and the department a tradition!
