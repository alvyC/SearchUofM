                        and government. You may also seek a career as a human resource management professional
                        across a broad spectrum of business and not-for-profit organizations. Or, you may
                        choose to take an entrepreneurial path and start your own business.
                     
                     
                     Beginning in the Fall of 2010, the BBA Management degree will be offered online as
                        a degree completion program, requiring 120 hours. You can complete the degree by combining
                        online courses with courses offered at the University of Memphis campus or satellite
                        campuses or by combining University of Memphis courses (online and on campus) with
                        a limited number of approved courses transferred from other institutions (see our
                        undergraduate catalog for more information).
                     
                     
                     Faculty for the online program are the same as those who instruct our on-campus program.
                        Your degree is offered through the Fogelman College of Business & Economics, which
                        is fully accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB),
                        the premier accrediting body in business education.
