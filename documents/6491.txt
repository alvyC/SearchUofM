                     The creative process for the twins' collaborative art often baffles collectors, who
                        assume the brothers must have a defined technique to accomplish pieces that flow so
                        smoothly. However, the brothers insist that there is no one way they create their
                        collaborative art. On the contrary, Terry says, 'Sometimes Jerry will start a painting;
                        other times I will come up with a sketch or idea. There is no one way we create. Our
                        twin collaborative art is about working together.'"

                     "Reliquaries, is an ongoing project, including a series of paintings based on the
                        photographic mistakes found in my growing collection of anonymous snapshots. These
                        are hand-rendered photo-copies done in oil on panel.
                     
                     
                     My work is an endless search for authentic ways to suggest that the observable world
                        is not as secure as it seems, to give significance to the unknown, and to reflect
                        the limits of perception. "

                        Benedict XVI created from 17,000 colored condoms.
