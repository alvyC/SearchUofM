                        the school began educating the people of West Tennessee.
                     
                     
                     In November 1921 the Memphis Annual Conference voted to establish a coeducational
                        institution, and in 1923, the school admitted its first male students. With that development,
                        the school's name was changed to Lambuth College, in honor of the Reverend Walter
                        R. Lambuth, M.D., a pioneer Methodist missionary bishop.
                     
                     
                     In July 1991 the historic liberal arts "college" became a university. During the school's
                        168-year lifetime, it earned an outstanding academic reputation and was recognized
                        as one of the nation's top colleges by U.S. News and World Report and The Washington
                        Post.
                     
                     
                     As a small institution, Lambuth fell victim to dwindling fiscal resources, and as
                        a result, it was forced to cease independent operation in June 2011, and the region
                        lost an important resource. Enter the University of Memphis. Recognizing the vital
                        role of the university, civic leaders and government officials worked to maintain
                        the Lambuth campus as a part of the University of Memphis, a public four-year research
                        university that is part of the Tennessee Board of Regents system. In August 2011 the
                        University began offering classes at the Lambuth campus in Jackson. The University
                        of Memphis is proud to have revived this campus and invest in this area. We firmly
                        believe that excellence in higher education knows no limits. We are nationally recognized,
                        but locally yours—the people of greater West Tennessee and beyond.
