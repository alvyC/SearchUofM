                     The W. Harry Feinstone Center for Genomic Research has developed and maintains a Biology Instrumentation Core (BIC), we provide DNA Microarray technologies as well as NGS DNA sequencing and data analysis.
                     
                     
                     In 2002, we added an Affymetrix GeneChip system for high-throughput DNA microarray
                        analysis. In 2013, the BIC acquired the Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencer, further advancing the center’s functional genomics focus. Today
                        the center is capable of sequencing reference genomes for many scientifically important
                        species. During the past year, the core has undertaken the task of sequencing the
                        entire genome of the Tennessee Ladybug (Coccinella septempunctata) using the Illumina
                        MiSeq sequencer.
                     
                     
                     The Center utilizes the HPC computational resources provided by ITS at the Univefluorescent_microscopersity of Memphis as well as an
                        FCGR dedicated computer cluster. The BSIC also provide case-by-case consultative services
                        for DNA microarray, next generation DNA sequencing, DNA size selection, cloning and
                        protein expression, realtime PCR, tissue culture and cell transfection. This capability
                        has been made possible by the expertise brought to the Center by Drs. Thomas and Carrie
                        Sutter, as well as the capitalization of equipment that has occurred over twelve years
                        since the Center’s development.
                     
                     
                     The Center provides salary support for the BIC, as well as maintenance of instrumentation
