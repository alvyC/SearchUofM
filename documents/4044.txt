                     Audit Courses
                     
                     Students who are admitted to the University of Memphis may register to audit a course
                        with the prior approval of the instructor and the head of the academic unit or designate.
                        Students enrolling on an audit basis do not receive academic credit for that course.
                        Particularly in high-demand courses, academic units should make sure that students
                        who need these courses for degree credit can be accommodated before they issue permits
                        for audits. Audits should not be used simply as a vehicle for obtaining access to
                        laboratory or studio facilities.
                     
                     
                     Auditors are not required to take examinations and do not receive a regular letter
                        grade. The student and the instructor should reach a precise agreement as to the extent
                        and nature of the students participation in the course, including class discussion,
                        projects, and readings. Students auditing a course will receive "audit" (AU) on the
                        transcript only if they have attended regularly and participated according to the
                        prior agreement with the instructor.
                     
                     
                     A student may not change from a grade point basis to audit or from audit to a grade
                           point basis after the last day to add classes for that session. Any questions concerning this policy should be referred to the colleges.
