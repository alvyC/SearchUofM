                     Great leaders are required for great schools, and the Memphis Leadership Scholars
                        Program prepares people to be great school leaders. This 12 month, blended-learning
                        30 semester hours graduate education program is built upon Tennessee Instructional
                        Leadership Standards. Successful students will receive a M.Ed. or Ed.S. degree and
                        a Tennessee Instructional Leader license.
                     
                     
                     
                           
                     
                     Purpose
                     
                     Research confirms that highly successful schools have great school leaders. And the
                        preparation of great school leaders cannot be left to chance. Successful preparation
                        requires a partnership between universities, professors, experienced school leader
                        practitioners, and local school districts. Producing great school leaders is the purpose of
                        the Memphis Leadership Scholars Program.
                     
                     
                     Process 
                     
                     The Memphis Leadership Scholars Program process includes five major components: Rigorous
                        selection, Team Trek experiential leadership learning, blended on-line and seminar
                        classes, mentoring, and outstanding field experiences. Candidates are nominated by
                        local school district superintendents (or designees) and must meet graduate entry
                        requirements at the U of M.  A three-day Team Trek leadership experience starts the
                        program.  The 12 month program includes on-line instruction that earns 9 semester
                        hours of credit.  Weekend seminars and summer classes earn 21 semester hours of credit.
                        The final semester includes attendance at a national principals' conference, on-site
                        exemplary K-12 school visits and mentoring. 
                     
                     
                     Outcomes 
                     
                     Results matter in today's educational environment. During the past decade, The University
                        of Memphis Department of Leadership has completely rebuilt its school leadership programs
                        to assure that graduates are well prepared to lead educational changes that can produce
                        improved student achievement results. Department of Leadership graduates have proven
                        records of success as principals, central office instructional supervisors, local
                        school district superintendents, and state school superintendents.
                     
                     
                     Partnerships  
                     
                     
                     The Memphis Leadership Scholars Program is a working partnership between local school
                        districts and the Department of Leadership. School district superintendents must have
                        excellent candidates who are well prepared, licensed, ready and willing to serve as
                        school leaders. Success in today's results driven environment requires strategic planning. The
                        rigorous nomination and selection processes can assist school superintendents to place
                        the "right people in the right seats on the bus".
                     
                     
                     Investment 
                     
                     Investing in an outstanding principal preparation program is a small cost when compared
                        to the immense responsibilities placed on today's principals. Principals are responsible
                        for major decisions involving millions of dollars regarding personnel, curriculum, instruction,
                        academic performance, finance, and community outreach. The right leader must be prepared
                        and ready when the vacancy occurs.
                     
                     
                     The Memphis Leadership Scholars Program investment includes all tuition, books and
                        fees, Team Trek, attendance at the NAESP or NASSP national conference, field experiences
                        and mentoring. The cost can be paid in full by the partner school district, or shared
                        by the school district and the candidate, or can be paid in full by the candidate. The
                        partnership contract will be customized to fit the needs of the partner school district.
