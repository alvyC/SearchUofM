                     Focus Area on African-American and Southern History
                     
                     The History Department at the University of Memphis is especially strong in African-American
                        and Southern histories. While these are distinct fields of inquiry and students may
                        work exclusively within one or the other, our program provides a unique opportunity
                        to study at the intersection of two histories that have informed each other across
                        the centuries in myriad ways, large and small. The center of our attention is generally
                        the nineteenth and twentieth century U.S., but our collective interests transcend
                        political borders, geography, and time, enabling students to pursue research that
                        is as global and deep as it is African-American and/or Southern. Departmental strengths
                        in the histories of labor, race, gender, politics, women, and the economy open up
                        further lines of inquiry and emphasis. Thus while Southern and African-American experiences
                        represent the focal points of our scholarship, opportunities abound for students to
                        find their own intellectual space between and within two dynamic fields of study that
                        have their own long and tangled histories.
                     
                     
                     That our history program allows for such creative reconsideration of Southern and
                        African-American history owes much to the intellectual strengths and range of our
                        faculty. Study here introduces students to scholars like Beverly Bond, whose research
                        focuses on African-American women in the urban South over the long nineteenth century;
                        Charles Crawford, whose scholarship focuses on local and oral histories; James Fickle,
                        whose research focuses on biracial unions and organizational efforts in the South;
                        Scott Marler, whose research interests include Southern business, economic, and legal
                        history; and Susan O’Donovan, whose research focuses on the productive and political
                        lives of African-Americans in slavery and freedom. Other faculty scholarship transcends
                        regional boundaries. For instance, Aram Goudsouzian’s research probes black popular
                        culture and the black freedom struggle from both local and national perspectives,
                        and Sarah Potter studies African-American family life in modern America and is particularly
                        interested in the interplay between gender, class, and the meanings ascribed to racial
                        difference. Dennis Laumann’s work on colonialism in West Africa, Guiomar Dueñas-Vargas’s
                        work on race and gender in nineteenth-century Columbia, and Andrew Daily’s research
                        on the intellectual and cultural history of the black diaspora in the Caribbean and
                        modern Europe give this focus area a global dimension. Our full-time instructor Colin
                        Chapell rounds out the focus area by drawing attention to the intersection between
                        religion and gender in the American South.
