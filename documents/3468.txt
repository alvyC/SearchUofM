                     Cities want to be on the leading edge. Companies want to stay on the cutting edge.
                        And everyone, it seems, is looking for the competitive edge. But to achieve these
                        goals, somebody has to go beyond the edge, into unknown territory to explore new possibilities,
                        make new discoveries, and develop the next generation of emerging technologies. This
