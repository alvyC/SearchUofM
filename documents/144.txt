Strategic Plan
The goal of the Alumni Association is to be the gateway to the University of Memphis
and the alumni community, meaningfully engaging alumni in activities, programs and
services while entrusting them as the guardians of the University. Based on its mission,
vision and goal, UMAA’s actions will be guided by four strategic initiatives that
will drive annual operating plans, will be informed by feedback from its constituents
and will be tracked and measured for success around selected key indicators. Learn
more about these initiatives here . Contact the Alumni Office at alumniassociation@memphis.edu or 901.678.ALUM for additional information.
