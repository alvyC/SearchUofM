			  UMAR You dedicated your career to higher education and left footprints on the University forever. Your connection to it doesn’t have to end after retirement. Join the organization specifically for retired professors, administrators and staff – UofM Association of Retirees. It’s your opportunity to remain active within the community you helped build.

Join UMAR and enjoy networking opportunities, special event luncheons, dinners, tours and educational excursions. Your experience is valuable. Continue to share it by volunteering with your UofM community. As a UMAR member, you will receive the same benefits and privileges as Alumni Association members with the addition of a Memphis Retirees email account.*
