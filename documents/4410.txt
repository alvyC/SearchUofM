                     The HABIT Laboratory conducts research related to addiction and health that is consistent
                        with two primary goals. First, we strive to conduct research that addresses important
                        public health priorities. Alcohol abuse among young adults results in thousands of
                        injuries, assaults, and fatalities each year, and can set the stage for a lifelong
                        pattern of alcohol abuse and/or dependence and thus meets this criterion.
                     
                     
                     We have conducted several controlled clinical trials that have demonstrated that brief
                        interventions incorporating motivational interviewing and personalized drinking feedback
                        can reduce heavy drinking among young adults (including both college students and
                        military veterans). These interventions are now being adopted across the country and
                        are replacing previous models of "alcohol education" that were not efficacious. Recently,
                        we were funded by NIAAA to improve standard brief alcohol intervention by adding a
                        behavioral economic supplement that encouraged engagement in constructive alternatives
                        associated with delayed reinforcement.
                     
                     
                     Although we are primarily interested in conducting research related to alcohol and
                        drug abuse, we are also interested in studying other health-compromising behaviors
                        such as risky sexual behavior and smoking, as well as health-promoting behaviors such
                        as diet and exercise. We are also interested in understanding how risk factors such
                        as impulsivity, high alcohol demand or reinforcing value, and comorbidity (depression,
                        PTSD) are related to both poor treatment response and the development of chronic substance
                        abuse problems/addiction.
                     
                     
                     The second overarching goal of the HABIT Laboratory is to conduct applied clinical
                        research that is influenced by basic behavioral and biological research (e.g., translational
                        research) and contributes to the overall goal of improving our scientific understanding
                        of human behavior. For example, we have used behavioral economic theory and basic
                        laboratory research to guide our applied research on substance abuse etiology, assessment,
                        and prevention.
