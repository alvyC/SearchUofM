                     Dr. Christine Powell Wins JSA Award
                     
                     Dr. Christine Powell member of the Center for Earthquake Research and Information,
                        has won the 2016 Jesuit Seismological Association Award given annually by the Eastern
                        Section of the Seismological Society of America. Â The award is given for outstanding
                        contributions to observational seismology particularly towards the understanding of
                        seismology and/or seismotectonics in eastern North America. Â Professor Powell has
                        made extensive studies of the major intraplate seismic zones of North America including
                        the New Madrid, the Eastern Tennessee, and the Charlevoix, Canada, Seismic Zones.
                        Â the award is named after the Jesuit Seismological Association that operated the first
                        world-wide network of seismic stations in the early 20th Century. Professor Powell
                        will recieve her commendation at the upcoming annual meeting of the Eastern Section
