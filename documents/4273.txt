                     Light microscopy equipment at the IMC includes several upright bright field microscopes
                        equipped with cameras for observation and documentation of histology slides. Some
                        of these microscopes also enable wide field fluorescence microscopy in upright or
                        inverted mode. An inverted confocal microscope is available for high resolution imaging
                        of fluorescent specimens or for live cell imaging thanks to a resonant scanning head
                        and an environmental chamber. This microscope also enables spectral deconvolution.
                     
                     
                     IMC staff can prepare samples for light microscopy and perform observations for investigators.
                        IMC staff also train and advise investigators with sample preparation and microscope
                        operation.
