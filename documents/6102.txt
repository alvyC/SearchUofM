                     The Day One program, offering a total of two (2) credit hours over two semesters,
                        is designed to provide first year and part-time MHA students with the professional
                        leadership and career development competencies required to succeed throughout their
                        career. Day One combines both team-based training and experiences to help students
                        refine their career vision. The Day One program's primary goal is to equip students
                        with the professional knowledge and tools required to achieve their long-term vision
                        of career success. Providing opportunities for structured self-reflection and examination
                        of one's leadership potential, Day One promotes attainment of personal and professional
                        leadership skills that enable MHA graduates to be effective on "Day One" of their
                        chosen career path.
                     
                     
                     The MHA Day One experience takes the student on a two semester journey of discovery.
                        Preceding the actual start of first semester classes for the on-campus MHA students,
                        the journey begins with the three day cohort-based Team Trek retreat where critical
                        self-assessment starts and culminates at the end of eight monthly sessions with the
                        skills required for a successful job search and life-long networking techniques.Â 
                        At the Team Trek and workshop sessions, the students have the opportunity to interact
                        with industry leaders and subject matter experts while engaging in experiential learning
                        exercises. A team of both Masters of Health Administration faculty and experienced
                        business professionals helps students understand the importance of professional etiquette,
                        communication skills, the value of emotional intelligence, how to best craft a resume
                        and cover letters, execute a job search strategy and finally, prepare for interviews.
