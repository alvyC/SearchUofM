                        About Nancy Apple
                        
                        Nancy Apple has been dubbed the reigning "Queen of Country in Memphis" by Memphis
                           Magazine's City Guide, and the "Princess of Twang" by The Commercial Appeal. From
                           classic country tunes to memorable ballads and honey-flavored cheatin' songs, Nancy
                           rocks-and-rolls with a twist that is twangled up in the blues. It's genuine y'alterna-honk
                           that is outside the lines and far from ordinary.
                        
                        
                        Nancy plays drums, guitar, harmonica and dabbles on the accordion and concertina.
                           She has been nominated more than a dozen times for a Premier Player Award in Memphis
                           in the songwriting, Female Vocalist and Community Service categories, and was a finalist
                           in the International Songwriting Competition in 2002 and 2003. She has appeared in
                           numerous movies and videos with stars Harvey Keitel, Linda Gail Lewis and Bridget
                           Fonda, has been endorsed by Gibson Guitars, and played drums in The Hellcats and with
                           bluesman great Willie Cobbs. She did a stint as the Tennessee Triple Threat with Duane
                           Jarvis and Phil Lee, and is currently working on a duo record with Rob McNurlin. Nancy
                           has sung backup with Todd Snider, Dan Baird, Keith Sykes, Mark Lindsay, Reba Russell,
                           Barbara Blue, Jay Ruffin and Cory Branan. Nancy is also known as The Cadillac Cowgirl,
                           and has been a deejay on WEVL in Memphis doing a Monday afternoon drive show (CarTunes)
