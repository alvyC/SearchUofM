                     Some say that the hottest little jazz club around is the Germantown Performing Arts
                        Center! Featuring both new and well established artists, it gives Jazz Lovers the
                        opportunity to get up close and personal with live music.
                     
                     
                     On Friday, November 11th, 2016 at 7 p.m., Jazz in the Box presents pianist and composer
                        Bill Cunliffe. He is known for his innovative and swinging recordings and compositions;
                        and has worked with established musicians such as Frank Sinatra, Joe Henderson, Freddie
                        Hubbard, Benny Golson, and James Moody.
                     
                     
                     Cunliffe has won a Grammy Award, in addition to two Emmy nominations. He is considered
                        to be a musical "Jack of all trades" as he performs with a big band, Latin band, and
                        classical jazz ensemble.
