NOTES: 

 
(1)   Newspapers covered in this index are:
             Memphis Appeal
             Memphis Argus
             Memphis Avalanche
             Memphis Bulletin  (pro-Union newspaper)
             Memphis Public Ledger

(2)   Unless otherwise noted, businesses, buildings, hotels, hospitals, etc. are located in Memphis.  

(3)   Prior to the formation of the Confederate States of America in February 1861, I use the subheading Southern States.  After February 1861, I use Confederate States of America to refer to those states that seceded from the United States.  States that were effectively occupied by United States forces and had begun the process of re-integration were again referred to under the heading of Southern States.

(4)   I have attempted to follow the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion when referring to a military engagement, i.e. affair, engagement, assault, skirmish, battle, etc.  I have also used subject terms assigned by the Library of Congress to the event if the popular use terminology uses battle instead of action or engagement.  If the event doesnt appear in Dyers then I defaulted to the terms skirmish or raid.  Campaign names generally follow the guidelines set by Civil War Battle Summaries by Campaign

(5)   Army units are Confederate unless indicated by (U.S.) for Federal units.  For claritys sake, I have distinguished between common terms such as soldier, prisoners of war, strategy, etc. by the subheading of Union or Confederate.

(6)   As far as possible, I have tried to confirm events chronicled by the Appeal in the Official Records or in Dyers Compendium.  However, some news accounts of events may have been sensationalized to reflect the needs of propaganda or are received through unsubstantiated sources, i.e. word of mouth.

(7)   General military activity in a state is listed under the name of the state with a subheading of Military campaigns followed by the year.  Specific campaigns are listed under the name of the campaign.  I have attempted to match events described in news reports to campaigns wherever possible, but it wasnt always possible so some campaign activity may appear under the heading for general activity.  

Military campaigns, (year) is used as an umbrella term to cover military activity, campaigns, battles, and/or skirmishes taking place within a particular state or region without identifying a particular campaign.  Individual battles and skirmishes will also be indexed by name or locale.  For more detailed information, you can go to the following sources: 
             The War of the Rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies
             Supplement to the Official records of the Union and Confederate Armies
            Dyer, Frederick Henry.  A compendium of the War of the Rebellion

(8)   An entry cited as: August 28, 1860, 2:4 can be found on August 28, 1860, page 2, column 4.

(9)   Abbreviations:  ad = advertisements   obit = obituary

(10)   The pages are numbered in the order they appear in the microfilm version of the paper.  In some cases this may differ from the page order in the print version.

(11)       6.   For help in using this index there is a guide to subject headings used in this index.
