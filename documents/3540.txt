                     EXTERNSHIP PROGRAM
                     
                     The University of Memphis Externship Program offers upper-level law students the opportunity
                        to earn academic credit for carefully supervised legal work they perform in a variety
                        of practice settings throughout the Memphis area. Stepping outside the traditional
                        classroom, externship students learn by doing and observing, further developing essential
                        research and writing skills, communication abilities, and problem-solving techniques
                        under the direction of local judges and attorneys. To maximize this experiential learning
                        opportunity, externship students simultaneously participate in a faculty-led seminar
                        designed to introduce the essential habits of the reflective practitioner and assessment
                        of the skills, relationships, issues, and mindsets that prevail in the practice setting.
