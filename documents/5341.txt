                     American Studies Minor
                     
                     The American Studies minor engages students in an examination of the culture and society
                        of the United States, with attention paid to the ways in which Americans express their
                        basic values and give meaning to their institutions and everyday social practices.
                        These values, institutions, and practices are a reflection, in part, of the different
                        experiences of a people, according to their race, gender, class, and historical roots.
                        This minor provides an opportunity to explore the commonalities and differences among
                        Americans through an interdisciplinary course of study.
