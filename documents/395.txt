                        Unofficial Transcript 
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     
                     		
                     
                     
                     Unofficial Transcript
                     
                     If you simply want a transcript for your own personal reference (that is, you want
                        your own record of the courses you have taken and the grades you have earned), you
                        do not need an official transcript at all. You can use Student Self Service to view and print your unofficial Academic Transcript instead.
                     
                     
                     Note:
                     
                     
                        
                        Because the Self Service Academic Transcript is web-based, it can retrieve only courses
                           that you took in Fall 1988 or later. Courses taken prior to Fall 1988 are stored on
                           microfilm and cannot be retrieved online. If you need courses from Summer 1988 and
                           earlier, you will have to request an official transcript.
                        
                        You will not be able to view your unofficial transcript if a “transcript hold” has
                           been placed on your account. You will have to contact the office that placed the hold
                           to determine how to remove it. For more information see Viewing Holds .
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Access for Recent, But Not Current Students
                     
                     The limited portal access for former students has been suspended temporarily, so the
                        Unofficial Transcript option is not available to you. We hope to offer this access
                        again in the near future. Official Transcripts are available, however.
