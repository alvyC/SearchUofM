        SAE Tiger Baja 
    


        SAE Tiger Baja is part of the Society of Automotive Engineers at the University of Memphis. Tiger Baja competes in the SAE Baja Series. Our program has been in place for over 20 years, and we are consistently progressing. This project consists of the design, build, and competition of our SAE Baja vehicle. This year, we are registered for competition in Gorman, CA in April 2017 and we will be competing with roughly 100 other teams from all over the world. Funds obtained from MomentumUM will be utilized for various aspects of the program and some of these uses are as follows:
 
-Travel Expenses
-Improvements to Current Car
-Parts, Materials, and Supplies Necessary for the Production of a New Vehicle
-Public Outreach (Banners, Flyers, Display Booth Supplies, etc.)
 
Last May, our team finished 29th out of 100 teams in the four-hour endurance race at the Tennessee Tech. University competition in Cookeville, TN. This coming April, we will be competing in a SAE Baja Series competition in Gorman, CA. This series is sponsored by many industry leaders such as Briggs and Stratton, Cummins, Polaris Industries Inc, and DS Solidworks Corp. These competitions gather some of the most prestigious universities from all over the world; including the United States, India, Brazil, and many more.
 
Although our program has been around for quite some time, SAE Tiger Baja remains a relatively small group of students at the current time. However, we are taking steps to expand our program to include more members, sponsors, and contributing professionals in many different aspects. This semester alone, we have recruited over 25 potential new members and we intend to continue this trend into the future.
 
Your contribution is greatly appreciated by everyone on our team, and we thank you for helping to improve this program so that we may solidify the University of Memphis as a top rate competitor in SAE International competitions.
 
Best regards,
UoM Tiger Baja
