                        in PreK-12 educational research, evaluation, and consultation. We also provide services
                        in instrument development and assessment to institutions of higher education, non-profits,
                        community organizations, and businesses. As national education policy shifts, CREP
                        strives to provide up-to-date, relevant data useful to schools, universities, and
                        policy makers.
                     
                     
                     As a long-term contributor to the educational research field, CREP has extensive experience
                        in research design, execution, and program implementation and evaluation across the
                        country, including school, district, state, and multi-state programs. We have served
                        as a direct contributor to research addressing the goals of Race to the Top and No
                        Child Left Behind, as proposed by the National Academy of Sciences, the What Works
                        Clearinghouse (WWC), and the Center on Innovation & Improvement. Our fully staffed
                        statistics department has the capacity to manage and analyze large data sets using
                        both qualitative and quantitative tools, experience developing and running quasi-experimental
                        and Randomized Control Trials (RCTs), and thorough knowledge and application of WWC
                        procedures and standards.
                     
                     
                     We meet the diverse needs of the educational community by planning and conducting
                        high-quality studies, designing valid and reliable instruments for gathering data,
                        and combining scholarship with personalized, practical services. Our staff of nearly
                        30 trained researchers, practitioners, and research assistants have experience conducting
                        both small- and large-scale evaluations. Our diverse experience in education, evaluation,
                        and practical solutions for stakeholders' needs has earned CREP national recognition
                        for work in areas including:

                     In addition to our sizable bank of valid and reliable instruments, we design customized
                        quantitative and qualitative survey, observation, and interview tools to meet the
                        specific needs of stakeholders. We also employ formative evaluation methods for school
                        improvement decision-making and support, interventions for at-risk students, literacy
                        and early literacy, science, technology, engineering and math (STEM); professional
                        development, and school climate and culture. Our objective evaluations meet the requirement
                        for third-party evaluators mandated by major grantors, such as NSF and IES.
