                     Internships - Beneficial to Students AND Employers
                     
                     An internship is typically a one-time work or service experience related to a student's
                        major or career goal. The structure generally places the student in a professional
                        work setting under the supervision and monitoring of a practicing professional. No
                        matter how it's structured, an internship serves a vital role in a student's professional
                        development, as no academic experience is complete without a real world stage for
                        performance and results.
                     
                     
                     For students , internships are the perfect platform for gaining industry knowledge and applying
                        what they've learned in the classroom in a "real world" setting and for laying the
                        groundwork for possible future employment.
                     
                     
                     For employers , internships provide a fresh stream of early talent and play a critical role in an
                        effective recruiting strategy. According to Monster.com , "Employers overwhelmingly point to internship experience as the most important factor
                        they consider in hiring new college graduates for full-time positions."
                     
                     
                     Students and employers BOTH win through internship programs designed to mutually "test drive" potential future commitments.
