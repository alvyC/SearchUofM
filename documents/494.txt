                        community. This NSF-funded project uses thoughtful strategies to retain STEM students
                        up through to graduation. We provide support in a variety of ways, including a summer
                        Mathematics Bridge Bootcamp, research experiences for undergraduates, networking,
                        mini-grants for on-campus professional student organizations, travel awards and STEM
                        learning communities. Over the years, we've seen firm evidence that students who take
                        advantage of the MemphiSTEM program are more likely to be retained in STEM majors
                        than non-participating students at the UofM.
