                     University Marks
                     
                     Our signatures consist of the UofM Academic Logo, the University Wordmark and three
                        other identities, for which usage is restricted to specific entities of the University.
                        All marks are registered with the U.S. Patent Office. The UofM has exclusive ownership
                        rights of these marks. Whenever these marks are used they must carry the proper "®"
                        and "TM" as shown.
                     
                     
                     For questions, concerns or licensing contact the UofM Marketing and Communication

                     Primary Academic Logo
                     
                     The UofM Academic Logo is intended for use on all digital and printed materials, both
                        internal and external, and should be used in place of the leaping Tiger logo on all
                        non-athletic materials, except where otherwise noted. The Wordmark should only appear
                        in the provided proportions, either to the right of or directly below the Academic
                        Logo.
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     Pillar Mark
                     
                     The University Pillar Mark may be used in certain instances as a standalone graphic.
                        When used in this manner, the University Wordmark should also be present on the same
                        page.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Wordmark
                     
                     The University Wordmark should only be used by itself when the Pillar mark is featured
                        as a separate design element on the same page, within the same marketing materials.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                       Seal
                     
                     The University Seal may only be used on official documents such as transcripts, major
                        report and research covers, diplomas, contracts, formal invitations and engraved notecards.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Initiatives
                     
                     Only UofM-approved initiatives may appear paired with the Pillar mark. Please contact
                        the UofM Marketing and Communication Department for questions or to obtain approval
                        for any proposed initiatives.

                        and promotions. Additional information regarding this symbol may be obtained by calling

                     The athletic logo may only be used for promotion of our Athletic Department and its
                        licensed suppliers. Additional information regarding this symbol may be obtained by
                        contacting the Athletic Department.
