                     In addition to teacher preparation, our faculty are involved in numerous projects
                        that engage with the community on a local and national level.  State and National
                        level competitive grants have provided opportunities for our faculty to provide professional
                        development for K-12 teachers from school districts in Shelby County and the surrounding
                        rural counties.  In addition, our faculty have played leading roles in the development
                        of Common Core curriculum and assessment materials that can be found at EngageNY,
                        Eureka Math, and PARCC. Faculty have served on State-wide Educational Advisory Boards.
