                     New Student Orientation (NSO)  provides all first-time freshmen with the tools and resources to kickstart your first
                        year of life as a Memphis Tiger. It is required that you attend because it makes your
                        transition to college smoother in so many ways. Not only will you immediately find
                        a community of support, but you will begin to build friendships by staying overnight
                        in a residence hall with other students, touring the campus, and learning about getting
                        involved. Pretty much everything that makes you bleed Memphis blue happens during
                        orientation. 
                     
                     
                     Orientation is also where you will meet your advisor and register for classes. You are assigned an advisor based on your intended major. If your major has changed
                        or you want to change it, no problem. Just let the orientation staff know when you
                        check-in.
                     
                     
                     During your advising appointment you will:
                     
                     
                        
                        Review AP scores, dual enrollment credits, and ACT/SAT results
                        
                        Evaluate ALEKS placement
                        
                        Discuss requirements for your intended major(s)
