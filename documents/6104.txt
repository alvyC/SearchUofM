                        students for success in a variety of healthcare institutions. Through our strong relationships
                        with healthcare community partners, combined with innovative classroom and blended
                        learning methods, we provide our students with real-world healthcare management practice
                        and immersion experiences.

                        tracks enhances students' attainment of program competencies allowing our students
                        to transition more effectively into entry level positions or promotion and advancement
                        in healthcare management.

                        School of Public Health approaches to scholarship as it provides an avenue for our
                        faculty to collaborate with our community partners to generate and translate knowledge
