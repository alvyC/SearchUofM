                     UofM Has Record Year in Fundraising Performance
                     
                     July 22, 2016 - The University of Memphis has completed another record-breaking year
                        in fundraising performance. The UofM secured $38,536,048 in total commitments during
                        the fiscal year that ended June 30, compared to $36,774,471 in fiscal year 2015. The
                        total includes gifts of cash, pledges and planned gifts to the University of Memphis
                        Foundation, and gifts-in-kind and private grants to the UofM and University of Memphis
                        Research Foundation. The record total represents an increase of more than $1.7 million
                        over last year.
                     
                     
                     The University's donor base also grew significantly. There were 12,150 donors in fiscal
                        year 2016 compared to 10,359 in 2015, an increase of 17 percent. Alumni participation
                        is often considered an indicator of alumni satisfaction. Some 8,926 alumni made a
                        gift this year, compared to 6,766 in 2015. That 32 percent increase in the number
                        of alumni donors is a record at the UofM.
                     
                     
                     Private fundraising enhances the University's ability to serve students and support
                        programs that bring distinction to the UofM. "I'm so grateful for all of the amazing
                        donors who chose to invest in the University of Memphis and our students," said President
                        M. David Rudd. "Their support is helping us realize the potential that is the UofM
                        and the City of Memphis. I'm especially pleased to see the significant growth in the
                        number of alumni who made a gift. The increase in alumni participation not only helps
                        our students, but positively influences our position in national rankings, including
                        U.S. News & World Report."
                     
                     
                     Several factors contributed to the record level of support, including commitments
                        to the Time to Shine Campaign in Athletics. Gifts directed to the campaign will be
                        used to upgrade existing facilities for men's and women's sports and construct new
                        ones that include a men's basketball practice facility and a football training center.
                        Gifts to a new Music Center for the Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music also played a
                        key role. The Center will create an Arts District along Central Avenue, which is currently
                        home to the University's art museum, the Fogelman Contemporary Art Galleries, Harris
                        Auditorium and main stage theatre. Need-based scholarships inspired donors as well.
                        Gifts to these scholarships are a top priority because they provide access to the
                        UofM for motivated and deserving students who have financial need.
                     
                     
                     "President Rudd's leadership and vision for the UofM has set the tone for alumni and
                        friends to make strategic investments in the UofM," said Bobby Prince, UofM chief
                        development officer. "I'm always pleased to report increases in fundraising activity,
                        but the true reward comes when we witness these gifts being put into action. Every
                        gift has an intended purpose and the power to influence people in meaningful ways.
                        It is a real privilege to see how that plays out on our campuses every single day."
