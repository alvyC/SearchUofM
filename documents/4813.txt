                        Since the program was started it has spread to over 250 schools nation wide and now

                        St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. With the help of their team leaders, morale
                        captains, and executive board members, they are sure to have fun doing so!
                     
                     
                     All this work definitely pays off! Since the program began, University of Memphis
