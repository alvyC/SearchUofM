                        Signing on Stokely Carmichael
                     
                     
                     January 20, 2016 - In the 1960s, Civil Rights activist Stokely Carmichael coined the
                        phrase "Black Power" with the symbolic image of the raised black fist to embody it.
                        A charismatic, forceful, young and brilliant intellectual with civil rights rooted
                        in non-violent tactics, Carmichael became increasingly dissatisfied with racial inequality.
                        This led him to more militant approaches to achieve political self-determination for
                        African Americans. The book, Stokely: A Life , winner of the 2014 Benjamin L. Hooks Institute National Book Award, provides an
                        illuminating profile of Carmichael's journey of disappointments, conflict and hope
                        for a more just nation and world.
                     
                     
                     The Hooks Institute's annual National Book Award recognizes publications that best
                        advance an understanding of the American civil rights movement and its legacy. Stokely: A Life , was selected from more than 20 books that were published in 2014.
                     
                     
                     Author Dr. Peniel E. Joseph will discuss Carmichael's life at a lecture, lunch and
                        book signing at the University of Memphis on Thursday, Feb. 11, as part of the Hooks

                     In 1996, University of Memphis officials received approval from the Tennessee Board
                        of Regents to create the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change in the College
                        of Arts & Sciences. The mission of the Institute is teaching, studying and promoting
                        civil rights and social change. The Hooks Institute archives include Hooks' personal
                        papers, which are housed in the Mississippi Valley Collection in the University's
                        McWherter Library. To learn more about the Hooks Institute, visit memphis.edu/benhooks .
