                        record, and is itself considered part of the student's academic record, writing a
                        letter of recommendation is not as straightforward as you might think. Key considerations
                        are discussed below, but first review these terms.
                     
                     
                     Terms
                     
                     
                        
                        Personally identifiable information from the student's education record This is non-directory information such as student courses, course schedules, grades,
                           GPA information, etc.
                        
                        
                        Personal knowledge of the student Your observations on such matters as the student's work ethic, punctuality, reliability,
                           creativity, cooperation, etc. This excludes personally identifiable information from
                           the student's education record.
                        
                        
                        Release The student's permission for you to include personally identifiable education record
                           information in the letter.
                        
                        
                        Waiver The student's consent to waive his/her right to ever view your letter.
                        
                        
                        Request for Letter of Recommendation For your convenience, a form for requesting a letter of recommendation has been developed. It
                           contains pertinent student and recipient information sections as well as release and
                           waiver sections. Further discussion references this form.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Considerations
                     
                     Ask the student needing a letter to complete the  Request for Letter of Recommendation . In guiding the student through the form, consider the following:
                     
                     
                     Confidentiality Flag
                     
                     Does the student have a confidentiality flag set in the Banner system? If Yes , the student must give you permission to write a letter ( by completing the form),
                        whether it will contain personally identifiable information from the student's education
                        record or not.
                     
                     
                     Release of the Student's Education Record Information
                     
                     Is the student willing to have student education record to be included in the letter?
                        Have the student indicate Yes or No in the Release portion of the form.
                     
                     
                     If Yes , he/she should specify what information can be included; your letter may then include
                        the specified information as well as your personal knowledge of the student.
                     
                     
                     If No , your letter may include only your personal knowledge of the student.
                     
                     
                     Waiver of Student Right to Review Letter
                     
                     Since the letter of recommendation becomes part of the student's education record, which
                        under FERPA the student has a right to view, he/she would be able to view the letter
                        in the future.
                     
                     
                     If you don't mind the student's seeing the letter, have the student indicate, "NO.
                        I do NOT waive my right to review a copy of the letter at any time in the future."
                     
                     
                     If you do mind, ask the student to waive his/her right to review by indicating, "YES.
                        I waive my right to review."
                     
                     
                     NOTE : A student’s waiving his/her right to review letters of recommendation on our campus does not apply to a receiving institution. If the student does not waive his/her
                        right to review letters of recommendation at the receiving institution, the letter
                        may be viewed by the student as part of the education record there.
                     
                     
                     Processing the Form
                     
                     Have the student sign and date the form; then make a copy for your records. When you
                        have written the letter, send a copy of it and the student release to the Registrar's
                        Office to be imaged as part of the student's education record.
