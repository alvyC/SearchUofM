                        Requests for parking accommodations for employees executing University business
                        
                        Requests for visitor parking
                        
                     
                     
                     Requests for employee parking accommodations. Departments may purchase departmental parking permits (hangtags) to be used by employees
                        during the business day to execute University business for the department. If the
                        employee performs department business on a regular basis, the employee may retain
                        possession of the hangtag, although this may NOT be used as their own personal hangtag.
                        Departments may also designate a representative who will have custody and responsibility
                        for the permit. The representative may then issue the permit to department employees
                        as needed. The representative will ensure that the permit usage does not violate University
                        procedure. Departments will be charged on an annual basis for department permits at
                        the rate of $40.00 per month for priority or $23 per month for general.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: University Policy UM1701 , Disbursement of Funds, states: "University parking fees and permits for employees will not be paid from any University
                              funds. This applies to regular or temporary faculty and staff, part-time and student
                              staff, and any other individuals employed by the University."
                     
                     Requests for visitor parking. Departments who request special parking accommodations for visitors/guests are responsible
                        for payment of the parking fees for those guests. Departments are also responsible
                        for notifying guests of what lot(s) they may park in when on campus. Do NOT notify
                        guests of parking accommodations until the arrangements are confirmed with Parking
                        & Transportation Services. Access the Department Guest Parking Request Form here .
                     
                     
                     General Permit Parking. Cost for an Invited Visitor Permit which allows visitors access to General Parking
                        is $3.00 per day. Departments should purchase the visitor permits and distribute to
                        guests in advance of the guests visit, so they will have the permit displayed in their
                        vehicles upon arrival on campus.
                     
                     
                     Priority Permit Parking. Cost for access to priority lots is $4.00 per day. Departments wanting priority lot
                        access, especially for multiple guests, are encouraged to have guests park in either
                        parking garage. Priority (gated) access to lots other than the garages will only be
                        granted if lot availability allows. Payment for the guests' parking would be through
                        the use of Validation Coupons for Innovation Drive Garage or Service Tickets for Zach
                        Curlin Garage. Departments should notify Parking & Transportation Services at least
                        48 hours in advance of the visitors' arrival to obtain the coupons/tickets and arrange
                        for payment. Validation Coupons and Service Tickets cost $4.00 per day and are good
                        for one time usage only. Please note that multiple same day guests will not be allowed
                        access to gated lots other than the parking garages due to limited space availability
                        in the surface lots. If parking is not pre-arranged, the department guest has three options:
