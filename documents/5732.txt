                     The Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music awards numerous talent-based performance scholarships
                        each year to incoming freshmen.  All music scholarship awards are based on a combination
                        of talent level (as identified by audition), ensemble or studio needs, and available
                        funds. Early application is strongly encouraged. School of Music scholarships are
                        renewable for up to four years and require full-time enrollment during fall and spring
                        semesters.

                        School of Music scholarships are encouraged to apply to the School of Music by December
                        1, audition for the School of Music by the end of February, and be accepted by the

                     The Music Performance Scholarship is a highly competitive, renewable scholarship awarded to a limited number of students
                        each year who exhibit excellent performance ability and potential as identified through
                        audition. The award amount is determined by a combination of the student's audition
                        results, ensemble needs, and funding availability. The maximum award amount is based
                        on actual tuition and fees, but may be used for payment of any fees associated with
                        the cost of attendance. The award will be deposited into the student's account at
                        the beginning of each semester. HOPE scholarship funds, if awarded to the student,
                        will be applied to the balance of tuition and any remaining amount may be used for
                        payment of other fees associated with the cost of attendance. On-campus housing is
                        encouraged to provide each scholarship student with social and scholarly activity
                        opportunities that promote academic success.
