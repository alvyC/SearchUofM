                     RICHARD R. RANTA, Ph.D., Dean Room 232, Communication Fine Arts Building (901) 678-2350 http://ccfa.memphis.edu/
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     The College of Communication and Fine Arts has four primary functions. First, it offers
                        courses of study aimed at preparing its students to work toward careers in the fine
                        or applied arts, communications, or the performing arts, whether as practitioners,
                        teachers, artists, or consultants. Second, the college affords broad exposure and
                        instruction in fine arts and communication to students of other colleges in the university
                        whose degree programs may be enhanced by such exposure. Third, with a view toward
                        individual professional growth as well as general cultural enhancement, the college
                        vigorously promotes both scholarly research and artistic production on the part of
                        its faculty. Finally, the college seeks to enrich the cultural atmosphere of both
                        the university and the community at large through a continuing variety of public programs,
                        to include art exhibitions, media presentations, dramatic productions, concerts, recitals,
                        lectures, seminars, debates, workshops, festivals, and the like.
                     
                     
                     Through the diversity of these constituent elements, the college reflects the unity
                        and challenge facing the communicative artist and scholar. Ultimately it is our goal
                        to foster a more intense and profound awareness of the broad range of human experience
                        from which the college derives its pertinence and vitality.
