                     Phishing
                     
                     Phishing is the act of trying to obtain information from individuals usually in order
                        to conduct inappropriate or fraudulent activities.
                     
                     
                     Protecting our personal information is everyone's responsibility. Please report any
                        suspicious activity to abuse@memphis.edu .
                     
                     
                     Never reply to an unsolicited email that asks for your personal information. The University
                        of Memphis will never request personal information (i.e. your SSN, UUID and password,
                        birth date, or any account numbers) via email. Other reputable institutions (your
                        bank, credit card company, or loan officers) would not email you requesting this type
                        of information either.
                     
                     
                     Never click on any links within an unsolicited email. Links within a phishing email
                        often lead to counterfeit internet sites. For example, a phishing email may contain
                        the link "Click here to update your information" and then lead to a phony business
                        website requesting personal information. Always visit an institution's website directly,
                        using their official URL.   Example of phishing email is located here.
                     
                     Always use common sense and good judgment. The University operates a broad array of
                        security-related hardware and software designed to safeguard sensitive personal and
                        institutional data. However, our networks and services are connected to the Internet,
                        and we cannot block every fraudulent action that occurs on the world wide web. We
                        need everyone to look carefully at what appears in your email - if it looks suspect,
                        it probably is.
                     
                     
                     Remember - it is a violation of University policy UM1535 - Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources  to share your account information and/or password with anyone.
