                     Explanation of course description format:
                     
                     The official course title appears in boldface type following the course number. The
                        figures in parentheses after the course title denote the number of semester hours
                        of credit for that course. If the credit is variable, to be determined by the department,
                        that fact is indicated by the minimum and maximum credit, as BIOL 4000 (2-4).
                     
                     
                     If the phrase "Same as . . ." and another course number appear in parentheses following
                        the credit hours, the course is cross listed with a course in another department,
                        and when offered by both departments, may be taken through either. If another course
                        number in parenthesis follows the credit hours, it is the former number for the same
                        course. Credit may not be received for both the former number and the current number
                        of the same course.
                     
                     
                     For those courses including regular laboratory hours, the lecture/laboratory hour
                        distribution is written in italics near the end of the course description. At the
                        end of many course descriptions, prerequisites and/or corequisites are listed. Students
                        are responsible for meeting the stated prerequisites prior to enrolling for the course.
                     
                     
                     A [G] at the end of the course description indicates that the course may be used to
                        fulfill University General Education Program requirements. These requirements vary
                        somewhat according to the particular degree program or major.
                     
                     
                     Courses are numbered according to the following system:
                     
                     0001-0999 Courses for which the credit does not apply toward minimum degree requirements
                        or for which credit is restricted. 1000-1999 Courses primarily for freshmen 2000-2999 Courses primarily for sophomores 3000-3999 Courses primarily for juniors 4000-4999 Courses primarily for seniors and for which graduate credit is not offered. (There is sometimes a corresponding 6000 number for which graduate credit is offered
                        to graduate students who fulfill the additional requirements for such credit.)
                     
                     
                     1000-2000 level courses are lower division courses, 3000-4000 level courses are upper
                        division courses. Course numbers have no reference to the semester in which the courses
                        are taught.
