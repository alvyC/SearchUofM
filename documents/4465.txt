                     MOLD INFORMATION FOR BUILDING OCCUPANTS
                     
                     Molds can be found almost anywhere; they can grow on virtually any organic substance,
                        as long as moisture is present. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or
                        on building materials, mold growth will often occur, particularly if the moisture
                        problem remains undiscovered or unaddressed. It is impossible to eliminate all molds
                        and mold spores in the indoor environment; however, mold growth can be controlled
                        indoors by controlling the moisture levels.Â It is important to report moisture issues
                        quickly to eliminate the moisture and reduce the risk of mold growth. Â  Report visible mold to EH&S for investigation.
                     
                     Here are some tips for avoiding mold growth in your building:
                     
                     
                        
                        Report stained/bowed ceiling tiles to your supervisor or Physical Plant for an investigation
                           of the water source.
                        
                        
                        Report condensation seen forming on windows, walls, or pipes to your supervisor for
                           investigation and action.
                        
                        
                        Report water infiltration around windows or exterior walls to your supervisor and
                           Physical Plant for investigation and repairs.
                        
                        
                        Do not block or shut vents or building air returns.
                        
                        Do not over water plants. (Periodically break up dirt around the plant to avoid mold
                           overgrowth in the dirt.)
                        
                        
                        Clean-up water spills immediately.
                        
                        Minimize accumulations of paper, cardboard, and other cellulose-based materials.
                        
                        Clean your work area routinely.
                        
                        Avoid concentrating materials and equipment within offices and other small or poorly
                           ventilated locations.
                        
                        
                        If carpet is present in your work area, have it cleaned regularly.
                        
                        Avoid portable humidifiers.
