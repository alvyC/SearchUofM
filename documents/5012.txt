                              The ongoing daily sampling programme of the fish fauna in the Dutch Wadden Sea using fixed gear was analysed for the years 1960–2011. Spring sampling caught immigrating fish from the coastal zone and autumn samples reflected emigration of young-of-the-year. In total 82 fish species were caught with no clear trend in biodiversity. In both spring and autumn total daily catch fluctuated and peaked in the late 1970s. From 1980 to the present catches of both pelagic and demersal species showed a 10-fold decrease in total biomass. Mean individual biomass decreased in spring between 1980 and the present from about 150 to 20 g wet weight. No trend was found in autumn mean individual biomass which fluctuated around 20 g wet weight. The trophic structure remained constant for both the demersal and benthopelagic fish fauna from 1980 to 2011, whilst the trophic position of pelagic fish in spring fell from about 3.9 to 3.1. Min/max auto-correlation factor analysis showed similar trends in spring and autumn species biomass time series: the first axis represented a decrease from the 1960s followed by stabilization from the mid-1990s. The second trend showed an increase with a maximum around 1980 followed by a steady decrease in spring and a decrease and stabilization from 2000 in autumn. It is argued that the most likely explanatory variables are a combination of external factors: increased water temperature, habitat destruction in the coastal zone (sand dredging and beach nourishment, fishing) and increased predation by top predators for the first trend, and large-scale hydrodynamic circulation for the second trend. We conclude that both the trophic structure of the coastal zone fauna and the nursery function of the Wadden Sea have been reduced since the 1980s. Our findings corroborate that ecological change in coastal ecosystems has not only occurred in the past but still continues.

                              Members of the arid Australian mulga (Acacia aneura) complex are fire-sensitive shrubs that produce mast seed crops after exceptionally high rainfall years. Such years also drive widespread wildfires in inland Australia, as high rainfall causes grassy fuels to accumulate, thereby enabling fuel contiguity to occur. Despite seedling regeneration playing an important role in mulga post-fire recovery, a dearth of information exists on the dynamics of its seedbanks. Here we examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of mulga seedbanks after a region-wide masting event at Laycock's Sandplain, central Australia. Masting had a profound effect on seedbanks, producing massive but short-lived pulses of seed in upper soil layers. After seed fall, seedbanks declined rapidly, and within 18 months had been reduced by predator depredations to low pre-mast levels. Our results suggest that mulga masting should enhance resilience to burning by providing transient seed pulses during periods of high flammability (i.e. after heavy rainfalls). The results also suggest that burn intensity will influence post-fire regeneration, by interacting with seed germination biology and post-mast seedbank dynamics. In our discussion, we examine possible evolutionary drivers behind mulga seeding periodicity, and hypothesize that rain-driven masting in mulga is a fire-related form of environmentally predictive masting.

                              This article shows how to apply generalized additive models and generalized additive mixed models to single-case design data. These models excel at detecting the functional form between two variables (often called trend), that is, whether trend exists, and if it does, what its shape is (e.g., linear and nonlinear). In many respects, however, these models are also an ideal vehicle for analyzing single-case designs because they can consider level, trend, variability, overlap, immediacy of effect, and phase consistency that single-case design researchers examine when interpreting a functional relation. We show how these models can be implemented in a wide variety of ways to test whether treatment is effective, whether cases differ from each other, whether treatment effects vary over cases, and whether trend varies over cases. We illustrate diagnostic statistics and graphs, and we discuss overdispersion of data in detail, with examples of quasibinomial models for overdispersed data, including how to compute dispersion and quasi-AIC fit indices in generalized additive models. We show how generalized additive mixed models can be used to estimate autoregressive models and random effects and discuss the limitations of the mixed models compared to generalized additive models. We provide extensive annotated syntax for doing all these analyses in the free computer program R.

                              The Wadden Sea has undergone many changes of which some (e.g., seagrass disappearance, dredging activities) are thought to have affected the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in these waters. Results of previous analyses of long-term variation and trends in SPM are, however, possibly biased by the fact that the data underlying these trends were not corrected for methodological changes in time. In this paper we analyze the variability of Secchi disk measurements recorded at one location in the westernmost part of the Wadden Sea during almost four decades (from 1974 to 2010). The Secchi readings were corrected for varying environmental conditions (solar zenith angle, solar irradiance and sea surface conditions) at the time of observation and then converted to a turbidity proxy that measures the attenuation of light due to suspended and dissolved materials in the water column. We tested a series of hypotheses to describe the seasonal and long-term variations of this turbidity proxy. The best statistical model assumed one common seasonal pattern within the study period and a strong variation in turbidity over the years without any apparent long-term increase or decrease in time (n=1361; r 2 =0.53). In addition, we found that most of the turbidity variation in this part of the Wadden Sea can be described as a function of SPM, chlorophyll-a, salinity, water temperature, the filter type used for the SPM determinations, and a still unidentified seasonal factor (n=401; r 2 =0.88). Comparison with annual averaged ADCP-derived SPM concentrations as determined from a ferry sailing across the Marsdiep tidal inlet (1998–2008) showed that the variability in turbidity at the sampling station was indicative for the variation in light attenuation in the westernmost part of the Wadden Sea. Because the intensity of the underwater light-field affects primary productivity, this new and consistent information on long-term variation in turbidity is of profound importance to the assessment of long-term changes and underlying mechanisms of the carrying capacity of the Wadden Sea.

                              The purpose of the current study was to investigate the factors which influence the prevalence of stereotypical behaviour in captive cheetahs. An information theory approach highlighted that the most optimal model was the controllable husbandry factors model with the size of enclosures, group membership, feeding regime and the ability to view other cheetahs in adjacent enclosures being the significant factors within the model which determined the occurrence of stereotypical behaviour. Increasing size of enclosure decreased this behaviour, whilst being solitary, being fed on a predictable feeding regime and having the ability to view other cheetahs in adjacent enclosures increased levels of stereotypical behaviour. These findings allow zoological institutions to focus on these factors in order to reduce the occurrence of stereotypical behaviour in captive cheetahs. Although cheetahs were used as the subject animal in this study, this type of research can be utilised for any captive species in order to understand unwanted behaviours or behaviours that zoological institutions wish to promote, so a behaviourally healthy captive population can be exhibited, reproduced and subsequently conserved.

                              Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming., We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature., Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.

                              Reproductive cycles of marine invertebrates with complex life histories are considered to be synchronized by water temperature and feeding conditions, which vary with season and latitude. This study analyses seasonal variation in the occurrence of oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and mussel (Mytilus edulis/galloprovincialis) larvae across European coastal waters at a synoptic scale (1000s of km) using standardised methods for sampling and molecular analyses. We tested a series of hypotheses to explain the observed seasonal patterns of occurrence of bivalve larvae at 12 European stations (located between 37°N and 60°N and 27°W and 18°E). These hypotheses included a model that stated that there was no synchronisation in seasonality of larval presence at all between the locations (null hypothesis), a model that assumed that there was one common seasonality pattern for all stations within Europe, and various models that supposed that the variation in seasonality could be grouped according to specific spatial scales (i.e., latitude, large marine ecosystems and ecoregions), taxonomic groups, or several combinations of these factors. For oysters, the best models explaining the presence/absence of larvae in European coastal waters were (1) the model that assumed one common seasonal pattern, and (2) the one that, in addition to this common pattern, assumed an enhanced probability of occurrence from south to north. The third best model for oysters, with less empirical support than the first two, stated that oysters reproduced later in the south than in the north. For mussels, the best models explaining the seasonality in occurrence of larvae were (1) the model that assumed four underlying trends related to large marine ecosystems, and (2) the one that assumed one common seasonal pattern for larvae occurrence throughout Europe. Such synchronies in larval occurrences suggest that environmental conditions relevant to bivalve larval survival are more or less similar at large spatial scales from 100s to 1000s of km. To unravel the underlying mechanisms for this synchronisation is of particular interest in the light of changing environmental conditions as the result of global climate change and the possible consequences for marine food webs and ecosystem services.

                              We review information from scientific trawl surveys carried out between 1977 and 2002 in the Porcupine Seabight and Abyssal Plain area of the Northeast Atlantic (240-4865 m water depth). Since the late 1980s, commercial bottom-trawl fisheries targeting mainly roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), and orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) have been operating at depths of 500-1500 m, intersecting the depth ranges of 77 demersal fish species that would therefore be vulnerable to fishery effects. Comparisons of trawls pre-1989 and post-1997 indicate a significant decrease in total abundance of demersal fish down to 2500 m. Detailed analyses of the 15 most-abundant species showed that nine species with depth ranges within the commercial fishing depth have decreased in abundance. Other species were either not affected (Bathypterois dubius) or only affected at the shallow end of their range (Coryphaenoides guentheri). Species with a minimum depth of occurrence >1500 m (Coryphaenoides armatus and Coryphaenoides leptolepis) increased in abundance over part of their depth range. Decreases in abundance are probably caused by commercial fishing activities, an effect that is transmitted downslope by removal of fish at the shallow end of their depth range, resulting in declines at the deeper end of the depth range. The estimated fishery area is ca. 52 000 km(2), but the potential impact probably extends to ca. 142 000 km(2) and to many non-target species.

                              The factors affecting patterns of benthic [seabed] biology and chemistry around 50 Scottish fish farms were investigated using linear mixed-effects models that account for inherent correlations between observations from the same farm. The abundance of benthic macrofauna and sediment concentrations of organic carbon were both influenced by a significant, albeit weak, interaction between farm size, defined as the maximum weight of fish permitted on site at any one time, and current speed. Above a farm size threshold of between 800 and 1000 t, the magnitude of effects at farms located in areas of elevated current speeds were greater than at equivalent farms located in more quiescent waters. Sediment concentrations of total organic matter were influenced by an interaction between distance and depth, indicating that wind-driven resuspension events may help reduce the accumulation of organic waste at farms located in shallow waters. The analyses presented here demonstrate that the production and subsequent fate of organic waste at fish farms is more complex than is often assumed; in isolation, current speed, water depth, and farm size are not necessarily good predictors of benthic impact.

                              Measurements of the density of deep pelagic bioluminescent zooplankton (BL) were made with the Intensified Silicon Intensifier Target (ISIT) profiler in the Ligurian, Tyrrhenian, Adriatic, Ionian Seas and the Strait of Sicily from ∼300m to near seafloor. Mean BL densities ranged from 2.61m −3 at 500–1000m depth in the Adriatic Sea to 0.01m −3 at 4000–5000m depth in the E Ionian Sea. We investigated drivers of spatial variation of deep pelagic BL density. Linear regression was applied between surface chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration and underlying BL density. Chl a values were determined from satellite derived 100km radius composites (six 10-day means per ISIT deployment, over preceding 60 days). At 500–1000m depth we found a significant positive relationship between mean BL density and mean Chl a in the period prior to 0–10 days (at 1% level) and prior to 10–40 days (at 5% level). Beyond 40 days no relationship between BL density and Chl a was found at this depth. At depths 1000–1500m BL density values were low and no significant relationship with Chl a was detected. Generalised additive modelling (GAM) was used to assess the influence of benthic hotspots (seamount; cold water coral mound; mud volcano) on overlying BL density. A reduction in BL density was found downstream of the Palinuro seamount from 300 to 600m. No effect on BL density in the overlying water column was detected from the presence of cold water corals. Higher BL densities were detected over the W Madonna dello Ionio mud volcano than at other sites sampled in the NW Ionian Sea. We find surface Chl a to be a good predictor of BL density in the mesopelagic zone; below this depth we hypothesise that processes affecting the efficiency of particle export to deep water may exert greater influence on BL density.

                              Detecting and predicting how populations respond to environmental variability are eminent challenges in conservation research and management. This is particularly true for wildlife populations at high latitudes, many of which demonstrate changes in population dynamics associated with global warming. The Falkland Islands (Southwest Atlantic) hold one of the largest Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua populations in the world, representing c. 34% of the global population. The numbers of breeding Gentoo Penguins at the Falkland Islands have shown a high degree of inter-annual variability since monitoring commenced in 1990. However, proximate causes of annual variability in breeding numbers have not been explored. Here we examine 21 years of Gentoo Penguin breeding surveys from the Falkland Islands and assess whether inter-annual variability in the number of breeding pairs were correlated with proxies of environmental variability. There was a positive correlation between the number of breeding pairs and a broad-scale climatic variation index, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). In turn, the SOI was significantly correlated with spring sea surface temperature anomalies, indicating a more immediate atmospherically forced response to El Niño Southern Oscillation variability in the Southwest Atlantic than previously reported. However, we also describe a non-linear response to environmental variability that may highlight foraging plasticity and/or the complexity of regional ecosystem interactions that operate across a range of different scales.

                              This paper presents optimum sampling levels in discard sampling programs considering cost and precision objectives simultaneously and explores their dependence on both variables. The analysis is based on the Irish discard program: an onboard-observer voluntary sampling scheme aimed at estimating discard rates in trawl fisheries. Multistage analysis was performed to establish the precision levels achieved in the past, and a cost function was determined to estimate the financial cost of the program. Gear, fishing ground, targeted species, and International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) divisions were the main factors affecting discarding, together with random effects of the three nested groups considered: haul, trip, and vessel. Reductions in the present budget will imply only marginal decreases in precision, although changes in cost variables can have an impact on sampling levels. On the other hand, increasing the target precision by one-half will imply a considerable increase in sampling and associated cost, which will be difficult if not impossible to achieve. Finally, the analysis by fleet components suggests a marked increase in sampling levels, which emphasizes the importance of clearly stated discard sampling objectives.

                              Using a unique 50-year high-resolution time series of daily kom-fyke catches, long-term patterns of scyphomedusae in the western Dutch Wadden Sea were analysed and related to changes in environmental conditions [eutrophication in the 1980s–1990s and recent climate change (increased water temperature)] in the area. Over the years, species composition and general pattern of appearance has remained the same: the first species that occurred in spring was Aurelia aurita, followed by Cyanea lamarckii/C. capillata. Chrysaora hysoscella and Rhizostoma octopus occurred from June to July onwards. All species appeared earlier in recent decades and first appearance and peak occurrence of A. aurita was in part inversely related to previous winter seawater temperature. Last occurrence of C. hysoscella was related to summer seawater temperature and the species is present longer in recent decades. Phenological relationships might have been decoupled since the seasonality of the phytoplankton bloom did not change. All species showed large inter-annual abundance fluctuations, with prolific years followed by sparse years. Peak catches of the coastal species A. aurita occurred in the late 1970s−early 1990s when eutrophication peaked, however, without a significant relationship with total nitrogen input into the area. Unlike for phenology, the patterns of mean abundance of any species did not show a relationship to climate change in the area. This might imply that population regulating mechanisms do not operate during the planktonic phase but during the sessile demersal polyp stages.

                              Environmental conditions during the larval phase (food concentration and temperature) impact recruitment success of marine bivalves by affecting growth and survival. We analysed the seasonal match between environmental conditions and larval presence of six coastal bivalve species over eight consecutive years (2006–2013) in the western Wadden Sea, taking species-specific physiological responses to these conditions into account. The larval occurrence of four species overlapped with their optimum in environmental conditions as calculated following the Dynamic Energy Budget theory: the occurrence of larvae of Cerastoderma edule, Mya arenaria and Mytilus edulis matched with their optimum food conditions, while larvae of Crassostrea gigas were mainly found during the temperature optimum of this species. Larvae of Ensis directus and Macoma balthica, however, only occurred months after their most favourable food conditions. The first group probably uses the energy immediately after uptake for the production and release of gametes (‘income breeders’), whereas the second group accumulates and stores energy reserves for later reproduction (‘capital breeders’). Larvae of C. gigas and M. balthica were observed much earlier in the year than expected from previous occurrences and from formerly know threshold temperatures for spawning. These apparent changes in timing of spawning suggest that Pacific oysters and Baltic tellins have recently acclimated to new environmental conditions.

                              Conflicts between humans and crocodilians are a widespread conservation challenge and the number of crocodile attacks is increasing worldwide. We identified the factors that most effectively decide whether a victim is injured or killed in a crocodile attack by fitting generalized linear models to a 42-year dataset of 87 attacks (27 fatal and 60 non-fatal) by saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in Australia. The models showed that the most influential factors were the difference in body mass between crocodile and victim, and the position of victim in relation to the water at the time of an attack. In-water position (for diving, swimming, and wading) had a higher risk than on-water (boating) or on-land (fishing, and hunting near the water's edge) positions. In the in-water position a 75 kg person would have a relatively high probability of survival (0.81) if attacked by a 300 cm crocodile, but the probability becomes much lower (0.17) with a 400 cm crocodile. If attacked by a crocodile larger than 450 cm, the survival probability would be extremely low (

                              The use of evolutionary game theory and the concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) have come under criticism lately because game-theoretic models are often constrained to overly simplistic situations. Furthermore, game-theoretic models commit the behavioural gambit, that is, they assume that individuals have some unspecified decision mechanism that duplicates the outcomes that would be expected from natural selection acting on genetic alternatives. The producer–scrounger game is an ideal illustration of the criticisms aimed at the game-theoretic approach; it has generated a number of game-theoretic models that make specific predictions for highly simplified foraging conditions. Simulation models of the producer–scrounger game that incorporate the linear operator learning rule, however, have been more successful in replicating the empirical results. In these models, groups of animals forage for patches of food using a linear operator learning rule. The linear operator model furthermore provides a new prediction about the effect of variation in patch quality within a producer–scrounger game. Current models based on evolutionarily stable strategies and empirical investigations have always assumed or used patches of uniform quality. Yet patches vary in quality and some environments are potentially more variable than others. The linear operator model predicts an increase in scrounging behaviour when patch quality varies. We tested this prediction using captive foraging flocks of male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in two treatments with variable and nonvariable patch quality. The results show that as individuals have more experience in the variable environment, they increase their scrounging behaviour. Linear operator models may therefore provide a general and empirically valid means of exploring the outcome of animal decisions in social foraging situations too complex to be addressed by evolutionary game models.
