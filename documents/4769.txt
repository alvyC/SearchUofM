		Alert: Malicious Adobe Email Attachment Circulating On-Campus

				
			Posted by  Bambi Lange		
			
    
    

		
		On Tuesday, January 26th, 2016, a number of UofM users received a message purporting to be from the Adobe Creative Cloud service with a Subject: line of “Adobe Invoice”. The message contained an attachment called “invoice.doc”, that when opened, would attempt to connect to a remote server and install malicious software on the recipient’s computer.
The remote server has since been taken offline and ITS staff are working with units who may have had computers that were impacted by the malicious attachment. If you received one of the “Adobe Invoice” emails with the invoice.doc attachment, please delete the email message and do not attempt to open the attachment.
If you opened the attachment, please contact the ITS Service Desk by phone at (901) 678-8888 or via email at umtech@memphis.edu  or your LSP for further assistance.

		Technology Recall:
Microsoft has issued a voluntary recall for Surface Pro, Surface Pro 2, and some Surface Pro 3 devices. To check if your device is eligible, visit the Microsoft AC Power Cord Recall website.
For a personal device, Microsoft will ask that you sign in or create an account for communication about the recall process. Note: This is not your University of Memphis account information.

		Important Announcement: Change in Password Reset Process

		Important Announcement: Change in Password Reset Process
In an effort to enhance security of passwords and protect University data, ITS will implement a change in its Password Reset service. Effective immediately, the ITS Service Desk (Tier 1) will no longer, administratively, change passwords.  All UofM affiliates (faculty, staff, students, alumni, former students, etc.) will be encouraged to visit the University’s self-service Identity Management website located at https://iam.memphis.edu .  Here, you can initialize your account, reset your password, retrieve your UUID and answer your security questions to regain access to your account.
 
In addition, remember these important tips to ensure your data is secure:

Never share your password with anyone. This includes a UofM employee, friend or relative.
Beware of phishing emails that attempt to lure you to malicious websites.
Watch for email notifications about your password changing. If you did not change your password, please contact the Service Desk immediately.
Never respond to an email request for your username and password, or any other request to “verify” your account.
