                     Ned R. McWherter Library
                     The Ned R.McWherter Library is located west of Zach Curlin Drive and south of Norriswood
                     Avenue. Constructed under earthquake-resistant building codes, the McWherter Library
                     was designed to provide state-of-the-art access to information technology and to be
                     fully accessible to the disabled. It has 725 network connections throughout the building,
                     including those in study carrels, group study rooms and the Learning Commons.  Wireless
                     connectivity is provided throughout the building on all floors. The building's distinctive
                     feature is the domed rotunda, copper-covered on the outside and centered with an oculus
                     that floods the interior glass walls and grand staircase with natural light and spotlights
                     the compass rose inlay of the granite floor four stories below. The University seal
                     in the center of the eight-point compass contains a date which is changed each year,
                     allowing University graduates to make souvenir rubbings. Restrooms, elevators, and public copiers are centrally located on each floor. There
                     are public phones in the library which allow free local and toll-free calls. These
                     phones are located on the 1st floor in the elevator lobby, and on the 2nd, 3rd & 4th
                     floors near the men's restrooms.
