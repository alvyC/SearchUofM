                        About Dr. Connolly
                        
                        Dr. Connolly received his PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
                           in 1996.  Prior to coming to The University of Memphis, he conducted long-term research
                           projects at the Hopewell Fort Ancient hilltop enclosure in southwest Ohio and at the
                           Poverty Point earthwork complex in northeast Louisiana.  At both sites he specialized
                           in the analysis of previously excavated but unreported museum collections and their
                           associated records as a to limit the need for modern field excavations in addressing
                           research questions.  
                        
                        
                        He currently serves on the Editorial Board of Advances in Archaeological Practices and blogs at Archaeology, Museums & Outreach .

                           Archaeology. He works collaboratively with community partners to develop cultural
                           heritage programs. He also collaborates with  Proyecto de Investigación Arqueológico Regional Ancash on developing a sustainable eco-tourism and cultural heritage base in the Andean
                           village at Hualcayán.
