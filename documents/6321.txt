Profile Dr. Lamont Simmons is an Assistant
Professor in the Department of Social Work at the University of Memphis. His professional experiences include work in child welfare, mental health, and
professional development training for child welfare professionals, supervisors,
administrators, and foster parents.  His research centers on student
experiences in social work education, academic persistence and success, and
transformational learning in college and the workplace. Dr. Simmons is a
member of Epsilon Upsilon Chapter of Phi Alpha Honor Society of Social Work,
the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), and the National Association of
Social Workers (NASW). Teaching Philosophy My teaching is informed by the
passion I have for guiding students in the learning process and toward their
educational purpose(s). I characterize my teaching style as
student-centered, infused with critical inquiry as a means to foster
intellectual development. I work to promote student learning by offering
academic rigor coupled with instructional support. I believe that this
balance is central to effective teaching, and allows students to mature as
directors of their own learning. I am confident in my ability to enable
students to become grounded in the “art” of knowing what it takes to be
academically successful, and what it takes to transition seamlessly beyond their
higher education experience .
