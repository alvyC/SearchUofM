                     Student-Athlete's Role in Advising and Registration
                     
                     One of the most important functions of CAAS is to advise student-athletes for course
                        selection and assist in selection of an academic major. Academic advising requires
                        a partnership between the student-athlete and the counselor to ensure the best decisions
                        are made for the benefit of the student-athlete.
                     
                     
                     Student-athletes are required to meet with their Athletic Academic Counselor each
                        semester during the advising period. Student-athletes who have declared an academic
                        major are also required to meet with their major advisor. A list of departmental advisors
                        can be found here .
