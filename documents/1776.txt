                     About the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change
                     
                     In 1996, University of Memphis officials received approval from the Tennessee Board
                        of Regents to create the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change in the College
                        of Arts & Sciences. The mission of the Institute is teaching, studying and promoting
                        civil rights and social change. The Hooks Institute archives include Hooks' personal
                        papers, which are housed in the Mississippi Valley Collection in the University's
                        McWherter Library. To learn more about the Hooks Institute, visit memphis.edu/benhooks .
