                        Once you select Lookup Classes (from the Registration Tools portlet or elsewhere),
                           you should see the Select Term screen. Select the term you want from the drop-down
                           box and click the [Submit] button.
                        
                        You are now on the main Look Up Classes selection screen: you should see a Subject
                           list plus two buttons, [Course Search] and [Advanced Search]. [Course Search] Option This option allows you to search primarily by subject area. You must select at least
                           one Subject for a successful search; however, you may select more than one Subject.
                           Once you have selected a Subject or Subjects, click the [Course Search] button. Course titles for each Subject you selected will be displayed. By each course title,
                           you will see a [View Sections] button. Click the button to see detailed section information
                           (meeting days, times, instructor, etc.): [Advanced Search] Option This option allows you to search using several criteria at once; thus, you can narrow
                           your search on the front end. This is the search option to use if you are searching
                           for courses taught during a particular meeting pattern and/or time, or by a particular
                           instructor, or during a specific part of term, or a combination of these or other
                           criteria. You do not have to select a Subject on the main screen; click [Advanced Search] to
                           go to the Advanced Search screen. Here you can search based on the many options (Part
                           of Term, Instructor, etc.) and Subject. Again, you must select at least one Subject for a successful search, but
                           you can select several Subjects if you wish: When you have selected all the search options you want, click the [Class Search] button
                           to display detailed section information. Refer to the for information regarding the [Advanced Search] selection fields: Subject
                           
                           
                              
                              You must select at least one Subject.
                              
                              It is possible to select ALL or several Subjects in one search .
                              
                           
                           Course Number
                           
                           
                              
                              Leave this blank unless you are searching for a particular course. Example: You are
                                 interested in ENGL 2010, so you select "ENGL" for Subject and enter "2010" here.
                              
                              
                              You can use this field to search for a particular number-level within a Subject or
                                 Subjects. Enter the first digit of the level followed by the per cent sign (%). Example:
                                 "3%" will return a list of 3000-level courses only.
                              
                           
                           Title
                           
                           
                              
                              Enter a key word you expect to be in the course title. Example: "Anatomy"

                              This the method in which the course is delivered.
                              
                              All = all methods. This is the default. Usually you will not want to change this.
                                 However, this is a useful option is in locating web-delivered courses only .

                              Generally it is best to leave this field blank.
                              
                              If you do use it, it is best to fill in the first number only. This is useful in finding
                                 a 1-hour or 2-hour course you might need to bring your status up from part-time to
                                 full-time.
                              
                           
                           Campus
                           
                           
                              
                              The location at which the class is being offered.
                              
                              All = All Locations, including the Main Campus.
                              
                              The 3-character code at end of the Campus name is used in Look Up Classes results to identify the Campus (CMP column).
                              
                              
                              It is possible to exclude the Main Campus and list only courses offered at satellite campuses .
                              
                           
                           Course Level
                           
                           
                              
                              This is most useful for restricting your results to Undergraduate courses only or Graduate courses only, though other options are available.
                              
                           
                           Part of Term
                           
                           
                              
                              All = All Parts of Term.
                              
                              An academic term consists of several Parts of Term. You may enroll in multiple Parts
                                 of Term. (However, the Law Term is restricted to Law students.)
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                    A Fall or Spring term consists of these Parts of Term: Full Term, Regents Term, First
                                       Half-Term, Second Half-Term, and Law Term.
                                    
                                    
                                    A Summer term consists of these Parts of Term: Full Term, Regents Term, First Half-Term,
                                       Second Half-Term, First Teacher Term, and Second Teacher Term.
                                    
                                    
                                    Full and Regents terms run the entire semester.
                                    
                                    A course taken in one term is the equivalent of the same course taken in another term.
                                       Example: Full Term ENGL 1010 = First Half-Term ENGL 1010 (or Second Half, or Regents,
                                       etc.)
                                    
                                    
                                 
                                 
                              
                              
                              This option is useful in narrowing your selection to the courses offered in a particular Part of Term . (Example: You want a list of HIST courses offered in Second Half-Term only.)
                              
                           
                           Instructor
                           
                           
                              
                              The instructor(s) of record, if available.
                              
                              All = All Instructors.
                              
                              You can select multiple Instructors in your search.
                              
                           
                           Attribute Type
                           
                           
                              
                              Use this to search for courses that satisfy particular General Education (Gen Ed)
                                 requirements.
                              
                              
                              Note : Some colleges require that you take particular courses to satisfy Gen Ed requirements
                                 (ex., the college may insist on a BIOL sequence). Check with your advisor before selecting
                                 a Gen Ed course.
                              
                           
                           Start Time
                           
                           
                              
                              Use these options to find courses that will fit around your work schedule or other
                                 commitments.
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        When you find courses that you want to add to your class schedule, either:
                           
                           
                              
                              write down the CRNs and then go to the Add or Drop Classes page to register for the
                                 courses, or
                              
                              click on the open box to the left of each CRN and then click on either the [Register]
                                 or [Add to Worksheet] button (bottom of page) to add the course to the Add or Drop
                                 Classes page. [Register] actually attempts to register you in the course; if you are successful, the courses
                                 will appear in the top portion of the Add or Drop Classes screen; error messages/explanations
                                 will appear for any courses you did not successfully register for. [Add to Worksheet] simply transfers the selected courses to the bottom of the Add or Drop Classes page
                                 (Add Classes Worksheet area). The system does not attempt to add the classes in this
                                 area until you click the [Submit Changes] button there. NOTE: If you do not see an open box by the section you are interested in, then you cannot
                                 register for that course or section.
