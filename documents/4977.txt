                     AutoTutor is a computer tutor that helps students learn by holding a conversation
                           in natural language. AutoTutor tracks the cognition and emotions of the student and
                           responds in a manner that adapts to the student. AutoTutor has been developed to help
                           students learn about physics and computer literacy. Emotions are recognized by the
                           dialogue patterns, facial expressions, and body posture of the student.
