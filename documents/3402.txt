                        wage is determined by their experience and knowledge. The following pay range guidelines
                        should be utilized by the departments' supervisors when determining fair and equitable
                        hourly wages and subsequent yearly pay raises. There is a mandated minimum wage of
                        $7.25 an hour. Under Regular Student Employment, the department is responsible for
                        100% of the student's earnings. Under Federal Work-Study, the department is responsible
                        for 25% of the student's earnings.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: If the department feels a higher rate of pay is justified (i.e. does not meet
                           the following pay range guidelines) then a memorandum with job description and justification
                           must be submitted to the Student Employment Office with the employment paperwork to
                           obtain approval.
                     
                     Student employees may be hired at any pay level within a specific category depending
                        on their knowledge and experience.

                        Student employees' employment and the hours they work are reported according to procedures
                           established (University Procedure 2E:03:02A). All student employees must be enrolled
                           at least half-time (6 hrs.-undergraduate/law, and 5 hrs.-graduate) in order to be
                           employed on-campus during the academic year. Work-study employees must be enrolled
                           at least half-time to work during the summer. During the Summer sessions, if a regular
                           student employee was enrolled at least half-time in the Spring semester and has enrolled
                           for the following Fall semester, then they do not have to be enrolled in order to
                           work.
                        
                        
                        Advance approval should be secured from the Student Employment Office if any work-study
                           or regular student employees work more than 7.5 hours per day or more than 37.5 hours
                           per week (during the academic year). For student employees under Regular Student Employment,
                           if working hours exceed 37.5 hours in any work week, payment will be made at straight
                           time (the regular rate of pay) for additional hours up to forty (40) from all pay
                           sources. Premium pay (one and one-half times the regular rate of pay) will be paid
                           for hours worked over forty (40). NOTE: International students on a F-1 visa, according to INS regulations, who are pursuing
                           at least a full-time course of study may engage in on-campus employment, but not to
                           exceed 20 hours per week, which includes all pay sources. In addition, students on
                           a F-1 visa status may be employed on-campus full-time during school breaks, including
                           Fall Break, Spring Break, and Summer semester, or during their thesis or dissertation
                           phase of study, but not to exceed 40 hours per week, which includes all pay sources.
                           Since the Summer term at The University of Memphis is not considered a regular semester,
                           international students can be employed full-time and take part-time classes during
                           the Summer. Students with questions regarding employment visa restrictions should
                           contact the International Students Office, Brister, Room 120, (901) 678-4271.
                        
                        
                        Student employees under Federal Work-Study Employment can only work one job at a time.
                           Student employees (i.e. regular or work-study) employed on-campus during school breaks,
                           including Fall Break, Spring Break, before Summer classes start and after Summer classes
                           end, may work up to 37.5 hours. If working hours exceed 37.5 hours in any work week,
                           payment will be made at straight time for additional hours up to forty (40). Premium
                           pay (one and one-half times the regular rate of pay) will be paid for hours worked
                           over forty (40).
                        
                        
                        At the end of each academic semester (Fall/Spring, and Summer sessions) all student
                           workers will be automatically terminated. To be reinstated, the department must resubmit
                           employment paperwork and receive approval from the Student Employment Office before
                           the students may begin work.
