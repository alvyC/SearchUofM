                     Study Abroad
                     
                     The University of Memphis has a number of study abroad programs offered during the
                        academic year, some through the International Student Exchange program, and other
                        programs as listed on the STUDY ABROAD web site. If our university is sponsoring the study abroad program, students may
                        apply for financial aid to cover expenses. Student Aid budgets are adjusted to offset
                        the added program expenses. If you are interested in a study abroad program, you should
                        contact the International Programs Office directly at 901-678-2814. If you find out
                        about a study abroad program through your academic department, you should first contact
                        the International Programs Office to make sure that they are aware of the program
                        and that it is an approved program offered by The University of Memphis.
                     
                     
                     There are a number of approved study abroad programs offered during the summer months.
                        If you receive aid during the academic year (i.e. fall and spring), our office would
                        have to consider what aid eligibility you may have remaining for the summer. If you
                        are interested in a study abroad program for the summer, you should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) , if you have not already applied for the academic year.  Example: For summer 2016,
                        you must complete the 2015-2016 FAFSA.  Otherwise, complete a Summer Request Form.
                        You should indicate the particular study abroad program at the top of the Summer Request
                        Form.
                     
                     
                     If you must cover costs for a particular study abroad program before the standard
                        fee payment deadline, you should discuss your options with the Student Financial Aid
                        Office.
                     
                     
                     To receive financial aid for any STUDY ABROAD program (either during the academic year or summer), you must:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        be enrolled at least half-time. Law students are considered half-time during the summer
                           ONLY with 3 law credit hours.
                        
                        
                        have a Transfer Credit Request form on file with the Admissions Office
                        
                        be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen
                        
                        be making satisfactory academic progress ( according to our policy )
                        
                        
                        not be in default on any student loan or owe a repayment on any grant
                        
                        have remaining aid eligibility (especially as it applies to summer)
                        
                     
                     
                     Students MUST transfer credits from their study abroad program back in a timely manner.
                           Students who do not have foreign transcripts back to the University of Memphis within
                           2 semesters will have a graduation hold placed on their record.
                     
                     If you receive the HOPE Scholarship, please keep in mind that you are required to
                           have all final transcripts sent to the school immediately after the semester ends.
                           Your HOPE Scholarship will be cancelled for the upcoming semester and placed on hold
                           until all final transcripts are received and evaluated for continuing eligibility.
                     
                     You may review the Study Abroad Office web site for information on study abroad scholarships.
                     
                     
                     CONSORTIUM AGREEMENTS
                     
                     Occasionally students express a desire to study at another accredited American university.
                        If you encounter a study abroad program that is not sponsored by our university, but
                        is sponsored by another accredited American university, then you may still be able
                        to receive financial aid to cover the costs. If you are interested in studying at
                        another American university (even though you will be receiving your degree here),
                        then your academic advisor must give written approval (via a Transfer Credit Request
                        form) for you to take these classes. If you are a LAW student, the Dean of the Law
                        School must give written approval for you to study at another American university.
                     
                     
                     Once the necessary approval is given, a consortium agreement can be set up between
                        the home institution (i.e. The University of Memphis) and the host institution (i.e.
                        the other American university) that is sponsoring the program. The consortium agreement
                        covers basic federal guidelines and specifies what aid you will be receiving to cover
                        the costs for the program. The host institution also provides cost and budget information
                        to the home institution. The agreement is signed by both institutions.
                     
                     
                     FINAL WORD OF CAUTION:  To be eligible to participate in a consortium agreement it
                           is your responsibility to ensure that all paperwork has been properly completed and
                           submitted PRIOR to the end of the drop/add period of the intended semester.
