                     Sponsor should consult with the Coordinator of Facilities, Scheduling and Special
                        Events prior to finalizing a schedule to investigate potential scheduling conflicts.
                        A finalized schedule for space reservation for multiple dates should be submitted
                        on the appropriate form two months prior to the first event. Campus sponsor is responsible
                        for scheduling games, classes, activities and contests. A daily itemized event schedule
                        should be submitted in writing at least one month prior to the first activity. This
                        request should include exact dates, times, off-days and travel adjustments for athletic
                        practices. Adjustments to this schedule will be permitted with prior approval pending
                        space availability. Athletics must request space for individual instruction, conditioning,
                        and out of season workouts at least two months in advance. Request of space for UofM
                        sponsored events, camps, clinics, meets and tournaments should be submitted at least
                        one month in advance and in accordance with the University policies and procedures
                        established for such activities.
                     
                     
                     B. Scheduling Facilities
                     
                     All CRIS facilities will be scheduled in accordance with established priorities. Athletic
                        programs are scheduled according to a variety of factors. These include: applicable
                        priority systems, availability, rotations, special events, appropriate use, out of
                        season activities, and inter-departmental priorities. Scheduling conflicts between
                        individual athletic programs will be reviewed by the Athletic Director. "Bumping"
                        of lower priority programs from a facility space by another activity will not be permitted
                        once schedules have been requested and approved, unless special circumstances exist.
                        Special circumstances will be determined by the Director of CRIS. Periodically, pre-established
                        schedules must be altered due to special University activities, maintenance problems,
                        weather, or other instances beyond control. Every effort will be made to notify and
                        accommodate each athletic program's practice and competition needs when the need arises.
                        All visiting team practice requests should be forwarded to the Coordinator of Facilities,
                        Scheduling and Special Events for formal scheduling one month in advance. Every effort
                        should be made to avoid scheduling multiple contests of differing sports and activities
                        at the same time. Any items not specifically noted in these guidelines will be reviewed
                        by the Director of Campus Recreation Intramural Services.
