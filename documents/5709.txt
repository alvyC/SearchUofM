                     April 2, 2015 - The Herff College of Engineering – in partnership with the West Tennessee
                        Branch of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the University of Memphis
                        and Christian Brothers University ASCE student chapters, and the West Tennessee STEM
                        Hub – will sponsor a Canstruction®competition April 10 from 9 a.m. to noon at the
                        University of Memphis Herff College of Engineering.
                     
                     
                     Canstruction® is a unique competition that showcases the excitement of the civil engineering
                        field to high school students while helping to feed the hungry. The students are responsible
                        for the design and construction of giant sculptures made entirely out of canned foods.
                        At the close of the competition, all of the food used in the structures is donated
                        to the Mid-South Food Bank for distribution to pantries, shelters, soup kitchens,
                        the elderly and day care centers.
                     
                     
                     The competition includes 13 teams for 2015: Bartlett High School, Collierville High
                        School, Craigmont High School, Evangelical Christian School, Harding Academy, Havenview
                        Middle School, Houston High School, Hutchison School, Millington High School, Our
                        Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic School, St. Agnes Academy, St. Mary's Episcopal School
                        and Southwind High School.
                     
                     
                     On the day of the competition, teams are allowed to have five students building at
                        one time, and they have three hours to complete the structure. Each middle or high
                        school team is paired with a professional civil engineer and a civil engineering student
                        to act as mentors. These mentors are typically ASCE members. The teams can call on
                        their mentors for help with their design ideas. Structures will be judged from noon
                        to 1 p.m. by local ASCE members.
                     
                     
                     Prior to the event, the West Tennessee ASCE Branch solicits sponsorships from local
                        engineering firms to provide the initial cash donation for the purchase of cans used
                        in the designs. Once the teams submit a design proposal, the funds are distributed.
                     
                     
                     This will be the ninth year that the West Tennessee ASCE has organized Canstruction.
                        To date, more than 106,000 pounds of food have been donated to the Mid-South Food
                        Bank through this event. The competition this year will also be part of the University's
                        contribution to the Million Meals Challenge supporting the Mid-South Food Bank.
                     
                     
                     STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) student organizations across the
                        U of M also will be helping with the event, which is the largest competition to date.
                        The STEM student organizations will be serving as assistants during the competition
                        and providing representatives for a STEM student panel during the event luncheon.
