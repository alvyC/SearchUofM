                     About the Community Health Building
                     
                     The Loewenberg College of Nursing and the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders
                        represent two of the University's leading health care programs. Each has a long and
                        distinguished tenure at the University of Memphis, and both provide valuable workforce
                        development and community outreach services for the greater Memphis community as well
                        as important scholarly contributions within their fields.
                     
                     
                     The new 177,000-square foot, $60 million Community Health Building builds upon the
                        rich history of the University's Park Avenue Campus as the former home of the Kennedy
                        VA Hospital by creating a health campus that unites the faculty and facilities of
                        both the Loewenberg College of Nursing and the School of Communication Sciences and
                        Disorders. The beautiful, 145-acre campus holds a vibrant future as the home of several
                        health-related schools and colleges where interdisciplinary research initiatives can
                        be further developed and clinical and community services can be expanded.
                     
                     
                     In celebration of the University's Centennial in 2012, the University of Memphis launched
                        the Empowering the Dream campaign. Your support of this campaign allowed the Loewenberg
                        College of Nursing and the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders to realize
                        their visions while enabling the University to reach its $250 million goal. Your continued
                        support provides the necessary resources to inspire the next generation of Dreamers
                        Thinkers Doers.

                     About the Park Avenue Campus
                     
                     Situated just minutes from the main University campus, the Park Avenue Campus of the
                        University of Memphis has a rich history and a vibrant future. The former site of
                        the Kennedy VA hospital, the 145-acre property at the intersection of Park Avenue
                        and Getwell Roads was transferred from the US Government to the University for educational
                        use in 1967. Since then, the master plan for the Park Avenue Campus has been to develop
                        new interdisciplinary research initiatives and provide clinical and community services,
                        all while preserving the park-like beauty of its majestic oak trees and lush lawns.
                        With the ability – and vision – to create and grow our interdisciplinary initiatives
                        through development of the Park Avenue Campus, this area serves as an incredible resource
                        for the University and the Memphis community.
