		As mentioned in my previous post, ITS has completed the upgrade of eCourseware (Desire 2 Learn) over the holiday break.  Please note the following important information regarding usage and training on eCourseware:
Here is the  Training Schedule for the new version of eCourseware.  Registration for these sessions is available through Learning Curve (faculty only).
Customized videos, covering the basic tools of eCourseware, can be found at Teaching and Learning Videos . Faculty may also access these training videos .  Please note:  login is required for both.
Individual consultations can be scheduled at Consultation Ticket
If you have additional questions:

Email umtech@memphis.edu
Call the Help Desk at 901-678-8888. Help Desk staff are being given additional training in eCourseware and will be able to answer many of your questions

Thank you,
Ellen
