                        The series welcomes prominent authors to campus to participate in a public reading,
                        an interview hosted by our MFA program and often, a workshop. Past speakers have included
                        Gwendolyn Brooks, John Updike, Seamus Heaney and many others.
                     
                     
                     The series not only serves the local literary community, but also is a key component
                        in our Creative Writing program.
                     
                     
                     Cary Holladay , Creative Writing professor, explains that students have the opportunity to not only
                        have a conversation with acclaimed authors but also learn the business side of a writer's
                        craft as they help organize and publicize the series, useful skills as students look
                        to become literary professionals.
