                     Important Announcement: Change in Password Reset Process
                     
                     In an effort to enhance security of passwords and protect University data, ITS will
                        implement a change in its Password Reset service. Effective immediately, the ITS Service
                        Desk (Tier 1) will no longer, administratively, change passwords. All UofM affiliates
                        (faculty, staff, students, alumni, former students, etc.) will be encouraged to visit
                        the University's self-service Identity Management website located at https://iam.memphis.edu . Here, you can initialize your account, reset your password, retrieve your UUID,
                        and answer your security questions to regain access to your account.
                     
                     
                     In addition, remember these important tips to ensure your data is secure: • Never share your password with anyone. This includes a UofM employee, friend, or
                        relative. • Beware of phishing emails that attempt to lure you to malicious websites. • Watch for email notifications about your password changing. If you did not change
                        your password, please contact the Service Desk immediately. • Never respond to an email request for your username and password, or any other request
                        to "verify" your account.

                     What technology is my instructor using or asking me to use?

                     What hardware or software might my instructor ask me to use or buy?
                     
                     Trying to determine if your current device or software will work, or if you should
                        buy new, can be a tough task. Here are a few helpful tips to guide you in making your
                        choice:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           
                           Most modern (<7 years old) computers, laptops, tablets, or mobile devices will perform
                              sufficiently on our network. Older devices should be well maintained and free from
                              viruses, spyware, adware, malware, and extra toolbars or search engines.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           
                           Is a clicker required for your course? Clickers are audience response tools used during
                              your class. Instructors may use it to take attendance, capture in-class survey responses
                              and more. Clickers should be purchased at the on-campus bookstore.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           Depending on your program of study, you may be required to purchase specific hardware
                              and/or software to successfully complete course/program requirements. These are normally
                              communicated through your instructor.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           You can find more information about recommendations on the Recommended Hardware/Software for Students page.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Are there places on (or off) campus I can use to access hardware and software?
                     
                     Yes. The University provides access to over 1,300 computers to its students, using
                        TAF funded, general purpose labs. These labs can be found in several buildings at
                        each UofM campus and center.
                     
                     
                     In addition, we provide access to (25) software packages that can be accessed using
                        our umApps software service. To use this service, you need a computer, Internet access, and
                        an active account.
