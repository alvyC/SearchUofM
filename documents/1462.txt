                     The minor in Religious Studies is designed for students with a diversity of backgrounds
                        and interests in religion. Just as religion in interrelated with many other aspects
                        of society and culture, the minor in Religious Studies will complement coursework
                        and research on religion undertaken in a broad range of disciplines and major departments.
                        The required courses, Introduction to Religion, and Perspectives on Religion, provide
                        students with an appreciation of the variety of phenomena that has characterized the
                        religious experiences and actions of humanity, and with knowledge of the basic approached
                        that have been used to understand such experiences and actions. Elective courses offered
                        in several departments permit the student to develop his or her interest further,
                        by exploring particular religious traditions and ways of studying religion. The Senior
                        Capstone Project integrates previous learning and can be coordinated with work done
                        in the student's major, if desired, through arrangement of an appropriate faculty
                        sponsor.
