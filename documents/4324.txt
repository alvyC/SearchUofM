                     The study of Ancient Egyptian art is by its very nature interdisciplinary, combining
                        elements of visual analysis and art historical methods with textual evidence and archaeological
                        and epigraphic fieldwork. This concentration will introduce students, at the undergraduate
                        level, to various aspects of ancient Egyptian culture, focusing primarily on its art,
                        language and literature. The ancient Egyptian objects in the collection of the Institute of Egyptian Art & Archaeology , both on display and in storage, provide an invaluable asset to this program and
                        will greatly enhance the students' learning experience.
