                     Information Assurance Scholarship Program (IASP)
                     
                     Background
                     
                     The Department of Defense is seeking rising junior and senior undergraduate (third
                        and fourth year) and graduate/doctoral students who are interested in full-ride scholarships
                        for concentrated studies in information assurance. Students selected for the program
                        will receive full scholarships. This requires the student to agree to serve one year
                        of service to the DoD, upon graduation, for each year of the scholarship received,
                        in addition to the internship identified below.
                     
                     
                     During breaks in their academic studies, Information Assurance Scholars will receive
                        progressive, hands-on experience in information security internships. In return, scholars
                        must agree to some restrictions and obligations regarding curriculum, GPA, and pre
                        and post program employment. If all conditions are met, Information Assurance Scholars
                        will receive full-time conditional/permanent positions in agencies and components
                        of the DoD upon program completion.
