                     Applications will be accepted at any time. Depending on the level of potential risk
                        to subjects, the application may require full board review, expedited review, or an
                        exemption from the full review process. Please allow up to four weeks for a response
                        from the Board. Please note that for protocols receiving exempt or expedited reviews,
                        the full board meeting schedule and deadlines do not apply.
                     
                     
                     If application requires full board review, it must be submitted to irb@memphis.edu
                        on the deadline date. If you submit an application that needs to be reviewed at a
                        Full Board meeting, you will receive an e-mail informing you that you have been added
                        to the Board's agenda for review. The Investigator will receive the Board's decision
                        within 3 to 5 business days after the meeting.
