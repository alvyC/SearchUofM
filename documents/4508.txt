                        4,229, a 16% increase over the previous three-year average from 2008-2010. As you
                        might agree, that's remarkable progress over the past decade and a half. We still
                        have some work to do to reach our goal of a graduation rate well above the national
                        average, but we are making excellent progress. At the heart of our mission is not
                        only maintaining access to an affordable, high-quality, comprehensive college experience
                        for our students, but also making sure our students are successful in finishing what
                        they have started and launching a commitment to lifelong learning. Thank you for your
                        hard work and dedication to our students and community. The evidence indicates your
                        efforts are paying off, helping to develop students prepared to contribute fully to
                        a democratic society and shape the lives of thousands of students and families.
                     
                     
                     I also want to share our success with private fundraising for the University of Memphis.
                        As you know, last year we set a record with $36,774,472 raised. This year, our team surpassed that with a total of $38,536,048 raised. I want to thank our Chief Development Officer Bobby Prince and his team for
                        an exceptional job, with two consecutive record years. Needless to say, their efforts
                        have profound impact on our university, community and the lives of many, many students.
                     
                     
                     Thank you again for all you do for the University of Memphis and our community. I
                        hope the summer months are going well, and I look forward to the start of another
                        academic year in late August.
