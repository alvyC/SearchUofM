                     Focus Area on Women, Gender, and Family History
                     
                     Our focus area on Women, Gender, and Family history employs a wide range of departmental
                        historians whose specializations vary across geographical and chronological divisions.
                        As a group, we are particularly interested in understanding womenâ€™s lives in the past,
                        as well as the many ways that gender shapes both individual experience and larger
                        social institutions and ideals. Towards those ends, we conceptualize family relationships,
                        reproduction, sexuality, and gender relations as intertwined. We also view these factors
                        as crucial to understanding broad questions about race, labor, politics, religion,
                        and health across time and place. This focus area includes a number of faculty members
                        who work on the United States, as well as those who concentrate on the Ancient World,
                        Latin America, Medieval Europe, and the Modern Middle East. We also build on the Universityâ€™s
                        strength in women and gender studies, including the Center for Research on Women,
                        the Women's and Gender Studies Program, and a number of other departments and colleges
                        across campus.
                     
                     
                     Our faculty membersâ€™ scholarship and teaching interests expose students to a variety
                        of approaches to the study of women, gender, and family in an array of historical
                        contexts. We have a particular strength in this focus area among our American historians.
                        For instance, Dr. Beverly Bondâ€™s research and teaching interests center on the lives
                        of African American women, with an emphasis on the social, political, and economic
                        activities of African American women in the nineteenth century urban upper (trans-Appalachian)
                        South. Dr. Susan Oâ€™Donovanâ€™s research analyzes the gendered dimensions of work in
                        slavery and freedom, an inquiry that has led her to reconsider black politics in the
                        age of emancipation and, more recently, the multi-valanced politics of slaves. Dr.
                        Margaret Caffrey is a womenâ€™s and gender historian whose research has dealt with questions
                        of gender in everyday life. She has also considered the lives of American women, particularly
                        those who were predominantly lesbian or bisexual. Dr. Sarah Potterâ€™s work on family
                        and sexuality history in the twentieth-century United States highlights the political
                        dimensions of the family across race and class.
                     
                     
                     The Women, Gender, and Family focus area also has a strong and important global dimension.
                        For example, Dr. Guiomar DueÃ±as-Vargasâ€™s research on Latin American womenâ€™s history
                        focuses primarily on nineteenth-century Colombia. In her research and teaching, she
                        examines themes such as women and the family, children in colonial times, and gender
                        and the nation. Likewise, Egyptologist Dr. Suzanne Onstine is especially interested
                        in investigating the lives of women, and in particular the ways in which women's lives
                        intersected with religion, class, and ethnicity. Beverly Tsacoyianis works on the
                        Modern Middle East, with research and teaching interests in gender, health, and colonialism
                        in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially in Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt. Dr. James Blythe
                        writes about the complex ideas of gender and family in medieval scholastic texts and
                        teaches a course about medieval and Renaissance women and gender.
                     
                     
                     This focus area is rounded out with a number of full-time instructors whose research
                        and teaching revolves around questions of women, gender, and family. Dr. Chrystal
                        Goudsouzianâ€™s main areas of interest are family and private life in the ancient world.
                        Within her field of Egyptology, she studies the ways in which myth and religious beliefs
                        and practices both reflected and shaped ancient Egyptian conceptions of sexuality,
                        gender, and the body. Dr. Christine Eiselâ€™s teaching and research interests center
                        on women in colonial British North America, with a particular focus on the ways women
                        both resisted and supported masculine authority associated with formal institutions.
                        Dr. Colin Chapellâ€™s research examines the relationships between Protestant theology
                        and gender construction in the American south, while his classes emphasize the importance
                        of gender ideologies in American history. Dr. Michele Coffey considers racialized
                        constructions of gender and gendered rhetoric as political tools utilized by diverse
                        populations of southerners in efforts to mobilize in the 20th century.
