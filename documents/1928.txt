                     Computing GPA
                     
                     Computation of a student's college-level undergraduate grade point average includes
                        all courses attempted except credit/no-credit, audit, incomplete, developmental, and
                        satisfactory/unsatisfactory courses and "T" grades. As an example: a student carrying
                        five three-semester-hour courses for a total of 15 semester hours makes the following
                        grades: A, B, C, T, F, thus accumulating grade points in the amount of 12, 9,6,0,
                        0, for a total of 27. To compute the grade point average, divide the number of quality
                        hours (except "T" grade) (12) into the grade points earned (27) for an average of
                        2.25.
                     
                     
                     The Office of the Registrar's website gives detail information on how GPA and earned
                        hours are computed on courses that have been repeated. This page can be accessed here.
                     
                     
                     Graduation : A minimum 2.0 grade point average on all college-level work attempted is required
                        for graduation.
                     
                     
                     *Until Summer 2015, the overall GPA will reflect all college-level coursework—U of
                        M and transfer. Beginning Summer 2015, the overall GPA will reflect all college-level
                        work—U of M and any transfer coursework processed prior to Summer 2015; however, the
                        overall GPA will reflect ONLY U OF M coursework for those students whose transfer
                        credit is processed Summer 2015 and later.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: Beginning Summer 2015, a Tennessee Board of Regents' state-wide policy on transfer
                        credit and GPA calculations takes effect. Beginning Summer 2015, transfer credit will
                        be reflected in earned hours, but will no longer apply to the overall GPA (used to
                        determine undergraduate graduation, graduation with distinction, and athletic eligibility)
                        or to the overall combined GPA (used to determine academic standing, financial aid,
                        and scholarship eligibility, except for HOPE):
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        For New Transfer students admitted Summer 2015 and later, no transfer credit will
                           count in the overall or the overall combined GPA.
                        
                        
                        For Readmitted students readmitted Summer 2015 and later, no transfer credit taken
                           since last attending the U of M will count in the overall or the overall combined
                           GPA. Any transfer work previously processed will continue to be reflected in the GPAs.
                        
                        
                        For Continuing students, no transfer credit submitted to and received by the U of
                           M Summer 2015 or later will count in the overall or the overall combined GPA. Any
                           transfer work previously processed will continue to be reflected in the GPAs.
