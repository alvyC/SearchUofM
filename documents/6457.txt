                     Culture and Language Immersion Internship Programs The intent of this program is to provide Cadets overseas culture and language immersion
                        opportunities through military-to-military (mil-to-mil) engagements and/or humanitarian
                        service projects as well as visits to historically significant sites and serendipitous
                        culture immersion opportunities. Itineraries are host country dependent and vary.
                        Mil-to-mil engagements involve training with junior leaders and/or Cadets of host
                        country military academies. Humanitarian service projects may involve work at orphanages
                        or hospices or other on-going projects. The duration of these internships is approximately three weeks, including travel
                        time. Several days of academic, administrative, and logistical preparation prepare
                        teams prior to deployments.
                     
                     
                     Culture and Language Incentive Pay (CLIP-B) CLIP-B is aimed at promoting the study of languages and cultural studies that are
                        of importance to the Army. Language and cultural studies bonuses are graduated in
                        increasing amounts and in sufficient dollar amounts to provide a lucrative incentive
                        to persuade Cadets to begin to gain Culture and Foreign Language competence.
