			We are pleased to announce that Dr. Genae Strong, an associate professor in the Loewenberg School of Nursing, has received the prestigious Award of Excellence from the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, which is a leader in the health care of women and newborn children.
The press release from AWHONN follows:
Washington, D.C., June 16, 2014 — The Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) today presented the 2014 Award of Excellence in Education to Genae Strong, PhD, CNM, RNC-OB, IBCLC, RLC, CLC, CNE, for her commitment to educating student nurses. The award was presented at the AWHONN national convention in Orlando, Florida.
AWHONN presents its Award of Excellence in Education each year to an AWHONN member with an outstanding history of educating colleagues, patients and others. Winners have made contributions to the knowledge base of women’s or newborn health.
Dr. Strong is an Associate Professor at the University of Memphis, Loewenberg School of Nursing.  With more than 20 years of supporting breastfeeding dyads and their families through teaching, research and service, she recently designed a breastfeeding education curriculum for pre-licensure nursing students that will provide a standardized curriculum including competency measures. 
“Dr. Strong’s dedication to providing high quality, evidence-based education to current and future nurses is laudable,” said AWHONN’s Chief Executive Officer Lynn Erdman, MN, RN, FAAN. “Her passion for breastfeeding support and education helps nurses provide the highest quality care.”
Dr. Strong earned a PhD in nursing from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, a master’s degree in nurse-midwifery from the University of Kentucky, and a baccalaureate in nursing from the University of South Alabama.  She has authored several publications in the field of maternal-child health, serves as a member of AWHONN’s Research Advisory Panel, served on board of the Memphis Area Lactation Consultant Association (MALCA), and as the former president and currently as president-elect of MALCA for the second year.
