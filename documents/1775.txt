                     UofM Will Share $3 Million Grant for Cyber Security Preparedness
                     
                     October 6, 2016 - The Center for Information Assurance (CfIA) at the University of
                        Memphis will share a $3 million grant from the Department of Homeland Security and
                        Federal Emergency Management Association with four other universities.
                     
                     
                     On Sept. 23, the DHS/FEMA awarded a Cyber Security Grant (CTG) to the National Cybersecurity
                        Preparedness Consortium (NCPC), in which CfIA is a core member. The other partner
                        universities are the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), Texas A&M University,
                        Norwich University (Vermont) and the University of Arkansas.
                     
                     
                     Administered by FEMA, the CTG is a competitive grant awarded annually to entities
                        that play an important role in the implementation of the National Preparedness System
                        by supporting the building, sustainment and delivery of core capabilities essential
                        to achieving the national preparedness goal of a secure and resilient nation. FEMA
                        provides the funding via cooperative agreements to partners like UTSA to develop and
                        deliver training to prepare communities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond
                        to, and recover from acts of terrorism and natural, man-made and technological hazards.
                     
                     
                     This collaborative project will be led by UTSA; CfIA will receive a sub-award of $503,000
                        for three years to develop research based best practices for cyber identity and authentication.
                        The project will deliver a unique and innovative approach with "tabletop" scenarios
                        supplementing online training to demonstrate participants' knowledge and skill sets
                        to protect and defend systems with different authentication tools and techniques.
                        The online training will assist state and federal jurisdictions with coordination
                        and management of response efforts between emergency response organizations and critical
                        infrastructure IT personnel necessary to prevent cyber incidents.
                     
                     
                     On May 16, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Rep. Joaquin Castro's bill that
                        was inspired by National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, The National Cybersecurity
                        Preparedness Consortium Act (H.R. 4743), which allows nonprofits, including universities,
                        to work more closely[1] with DHS to address cyber security risks and incidents at
                        the state and local level. Earlier this month, Sen. John Cornyn introduced companion
                        legislation for consideration in the U.S. Senate.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Dipankar Dasgupta, CfIA director, said, "Because of the center's multi-faceted
                        activities, the University of Memphis is at the forefront of the research, education
                        and outreach on cyber security in the region, and has continually maintained its designation
                        as a National Center for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense
                        Education (CAE-CD) and in Research (CAE-R) by the National Security Agency and the
                        Department of Homeland Security."
