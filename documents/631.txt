                     Memphians treasure performing and fine arts (and artists) and have a history of supporting
                        a full range of creative organizations. Keep your eye on the Memphis Flyer for weekly listings of performing and fine arts events in the area. Two great local
                        blogs to follow for great things to do in Memphis are the I Love Memphis Blog and Choose901 . For a comprehensive listing of community arts organizations, see the following:

                     Fine Arts The fine arts in Memphis are fueled by three university programs and an independent
                        art college. All four institutions present gallery shows throughout the year. In addition,
                        Memphis has two fine art museums and a plethora of commercial and experimental galleries,
                        with a variety of museums dedicated to our long history of rock n' roll and rich musical
                        heritage. The South Main Arts District lies approximately a mile south of Memphis
                        Law. All galleries and shops are open for the popular South Main Trolley Night the last Friday of each month from 6-9 p.m.
