                        Exchange Spring Magnetic Materials: Exchange spring magnetic materials, hard-soft
                           phase materials, are synthesized via electroless platting method. Hard magnetic nanoparticles
                           such as SmCo5 are elecroless platted with soft magnetic layers of FeNi or FeCo. Usually
                           the soft layer is amorphous. Furthre catalytic nitrogenation of this composite is
                           carried out at substantially low tempearture at around 350 C to obtain FeN phase with
                           high magnetic moment. The low tempearture nitrogenation is possible because of presence
                           of Ni in FeNi which act as catalyst in breaking ammonia gas at low temperature.
                        
                        Rare-Earth intermetallics: The study focuses on improving magnetic properties of R2Fe17
                           intermetallics via grain refinement either by refractory metal doping for Fe or high
                           energy ball milling. The indept study is being structural and magnetic study is being
                           conducted using XRD, TEM, SQUID, and Mossbauer Spectroscopy.
                        
                        Core-Shell oxide nanostructured materials: Our group has developed experties in synthesis
                           of multifunctional magnetic core-shell nanocompoeite materials for various application
                           ranging from biomedical, solar, or magnetic. The core-shell nanocomposites are synthesize
                           using hydrothermally derived carbon nanosphere templates.
                        
                        Sr/Ba-Hexaferrites: Hexaferrites, Sr(Ba)Fe12O19, with magnetoplumbite structures have
                           been widely investigated and used as permanent magnets because of their high Ms, high
                           Tc and Hc, high environmental stability, and low price for production.The intrinsic
                           magnetic properties of Sr-hexaferrite are found to be affected by the partial substitution
                           for Sr or Fe sites, or both. Owning to the varied 4f electron shell, orbital and spin
                           magnetic moments, rare-earth elements were usually selected as the substitution elements.
                           The study focuses on various doping strategy for imporving magnetic properties of
                           these ferrites.
                        
                        Exchange Coupled Magnetic Nanocomposites: Ferromagnetic (FM)-antiferromagnetic (AFM)
                           nanocomposites are synthesised using mechanical ball milling and hydrothermal synthesis
                           techniques. Exchange bias properties of these composites are studied using SQUID magnetometer.
                           Several exchange coupled nanocomposite such as FeNi-CoO, FeNi-CuO, FeNi-NiO, SmCo5-NiO
                           etc. These exchange biased nanocomposites are synthesized using ball milling and wet-chemical
                           techniques in our laboratory.
