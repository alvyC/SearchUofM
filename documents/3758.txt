                     Finish Line Program
                     
                     Finish Line assists students who previously attended the University of Memphis and
                        have completed 90 or more credit hours, but have regrettably had to abandon their
                        dreams of completing a college degree. Academic advisors work with students to evaluate
                        previously earned credit, identify all possible routes to graduation, and explore
                        low-cost course completion strategies.

                        further their career goals and earn academic credit for their degree program.
