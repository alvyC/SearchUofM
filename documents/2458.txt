                     Faculty investigators within The School of Health Studies (SHS) are highly engaged
                        in research within their respective disciplines. Some faculty are world-renown, developing
                        and overseeing novel and focused research programs that command attention from investigators,
                        clinicians, and other health specialists from around the world. Research within the
                        SHS is funded through both internal and external sources, with faculty collectively
                        securing hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to support their work.
                     
                     
                     Due to the diversity of the academic disciplines within the SHS, several laboratories
                        and supportive research areas exist, which provide resources to faculty and post-doctoral
                        fellows, as well as to graduate and undergraduate research assistants. Within and
                        outside of the SHS, facilities are available to support cell culture studies, pre-clinical
                        animal investigations (from rodent to pig models), and human clinical investigations.
                        Our current equipment inventory for laboratories within the SHS can be seen here.
                     
                     Faculty investigators in the SHS are regularly seeking research participants. Please
