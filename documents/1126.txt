                     Why should I file an Invention Disclosure?
                     
                     Simply put, invention disclosures serve to protect faculty inventions!
                     
                     Patent rights are dependent on publication dates, and under US patent law, disclosure
                        is interpreted very broadly.
                     
                     
                     Types of disclosure that can put patent protection at risk include:
                     
                     
                        
                        Presentations at conferences, whether or not the presentation includes printed handouts
                        
                        Research abstracts presented in a public forum. This includes research abstracts that
                           are published before meetings either online or in printed materials
                        
                        
                        Posters shown at meetings (considered public publications)
                        
                        Cataloged thesis or dissertations
                        
                        Posting of information on websites. This includes postings on your individual lab
                           websites. If it can be accessed through the web, it is considered a public disclosure
                        
                        
                        Publications. Publications are considered public disclosures the minute they become
                           available to the public. For many publications, this occurs when published online
                           in advance of the printed journal
                        
                        
                        Published grant applications
                        
                        Meetings with company representatives or colleagues outside the UI where information
                           is disclosed without a confidentiality agreement
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     The invention disclosure is a way to document your invention with the OTT so that
                        the University can apply for a patent protection. By disclosing your invention to
                        the OTT at an early stage and applying for patent protection, you are free to openly
                        discuss and publish research related to your invention.
                     
                     
                     Is my research potentially patentable?
                     
                     In order to be patentable, an invention must be:
                     
                     
                        
                        Useful
                        
                        Novel
                        
                        Non-obvious to those skilled in the field
