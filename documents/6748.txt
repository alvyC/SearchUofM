                     Karen Moustafa Leonard , who recently left her position as associate professor at Indiana University at Fort
                        Wayne, has recently been appointed as professor and Chair of Management in the UALR
                        College of Business.Leonard, who says she “loves being a professor more than almost
                        anything,” earned her Master of Science degree in Commerce from University of Auckland
                        in New Zealand and her PhD in Management from the University of Memphis in 2004.
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     Her research emphasis is in organizational behavior, which Leonard describes simply
                        as “how people interact in organizations. It includes such things as dysfunctional
                        behaviors, accountability, and time orientation in organizations. Also includes cross-cultural
                        organizational work with lots of international colleagues, which requires travel to
                        these countries.”
