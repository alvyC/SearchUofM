                           principles and mechanisms of cognitive processes that underlie meaning in language
                           as well as their implications for behavior. We also investigate the role of behavior
                           and the environment on learning and real-time processing of language. Our research
                           uses eye-tracking and motion-tracking technologies to track behavior in real-time,
                           as well as neural network models of information processing and learning. We have anywhere
                           from 6-10 projects going on at any given time, and more information and up to date
                           research areas can be found on our website:  www.stephaniehuette.com .

                     Project Description:  I am looking for 2-3 research assistants for the current semester.  The positions
                           will involve 10 hours per week (in exchange for course credit).  I ask for a 2 semester
                           commitment, as it takes a while to be trained on the lab procedures.  We will be running
                           two laboratory studies this fall and our RAs will assist with conducting participants
                           through the procedure, helping to manage the data, and learning about basic statistics. 
                           I have set up a research clinic for women in the community who are seeking help for
                           emotional problems related to domestic violence.  RAs will have an opportunity to
                           help with community outreach, as well as learn more about research with help-seeking
                           individuals.  The ideal RA would be in his/her junior year, have a reasonable clear idea that they
                           might want to pursue a career in psychology or a related mental health field, and
                           be able to work cooperatively and somewhat autonomously

                        fundamental questions about psychotherapy: (a) How well does psychotherapy work? and
                        (b) Why does psychotherapy work?  In addition, the lab is involved in projects evaluating
                        other psychological and social processes. Psychology honors students may apply to
                        participate in laboratory activities and would be eligible for course credit.

                     Project Description: T.I.G.E.R., founded in 1998, is a nonprofit organization housed
                        within the Psychology Department and Psychological Services Center at The University
                        of Memphis. The Institute was founded after three years of gambling related research,
                        and shortly after receiving requests from individuals and families seeking services
                        to help with gambling related problems. Our mission is threefold: 1) to conduct basic
                        and applied research on gambling and problem gambling behavior, 2) to provide quality
                        low cost services to Mid-Southerners who experience gambling-related problems, and
                        3) to provide education to individuals, community organizations, and business and
                        industry about problem gambling. We presently have a number of projects that are in
                        progress. For example: the effects of alcohol on gambling, gambling influence on testosterone,
                        family structure and function on the gambling behavior of African-American adolescents,
                        and treatment of co-occurring gambling and alcohol problems.
                     
                     
                     Requirements for Student Applicants: Students interested in being involved on an ongoing

                     Project Description:  My work investigates the psychological processes underlying
                        political behavior.  This particular study focuses on party identification and social
                        interaction.  Research shows that partisan bias can lead citizens to disregard valuable
                        information in an effort to avoid disagreement with their party.  However, relatively
                        little is known about how these processes operate within a social setting.  More specifically,
                        I am interested in determining the conditions under which partisan biases are socially
                        reinforced versus the conditions under which social interaction helps to mitigate
                        these biases and even fosters deliberation.  Given the interdisciplinary nature of
                        my research, I would welcome involvement from students across the social sciences. 
                        Research assistants will primarily be involved in experimental data collection.  This
                        means working in the lab, helping to get the study setup, data management, and possibly
                        coding data once the collection stage is complete.
