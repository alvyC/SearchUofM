AMI is a capstone experience for students seeking the Certified Nonprofit Professional (CNP) credential. The purpose of the conference is to expose future social sector leaders to a vibrant learning experience that promotes best practices, innovative thing and awareness of the full scope of the sector. 
Participants have the opportunity to:
-Network with national nonprofit leaders
-Participate in real and mock interviews with prospective employers
-Attend workshops that focus on innovation in the sector, strategic partnerships and social change
-Serve as consultants, solving real issues facing local nonprofit organizations
How you can help!!
The idea behind us starting our campaign is to create a way to get all of our NLSA members involved in fundraising in order to attending the AMI Conference in January. Along with all of the benefits that come along with attending this conference there is a financial burden on the students and members going. We are hoping to partner with you in this campaign in order to get our team to Denver in January. By giving to our campaign you are investing in students and friend's future success and professional development. 
About NLSA
The Nonprofit Leaders Student Association is an organization for undergraduate and/or graduate students who would like to attain the CNP (Certified Nonprofit Professional) credential upon graduation. The Certified Nonprofit Professional (CNP) credential is the only national nonprofit credential preparing students (undergraduate, graduate and professionals) for careers in nonprofit management. Students who complete a leadership development program at one of the Nonprofit Leadership Alliance’s affiliated colleges or universities are awarded the credential and gain access to a network of nonprofit career resources, including the CNP network. Students do not have to major or minor in this field although it is recommended. Members will organize workshops and events, attend regular meetings, attend the national Alliance Management Institute (at least once before graduation) and meet other requirements to become a CNP.
