                     Travel Awards
                     
                     Travel Awards of up to $400 are available for student organizations to support undergraduate
                        student travel to STEM conferences, competitions or related activities. The travel
                        awards are designed to offer partial funding for undergraduate students to present
                        work, attend training workshops related to their student organization, or network
                        with scholars in STEM fields. Applications where students have obtained or have applied
                        for partial funding from other organizations are reviewed more favorably than those
                        that have not. A single STEM student organization can only be awarded up to $400.
                        Please submit travel grant applications at least two week prior to the event.
