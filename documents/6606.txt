                        About Meredith Ray
                        
                        Meredith Ray, PhD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Epidemiology,
                           Biostatistics, and Environmental Health. Dr. Ray received her doctoral degree at the
                           University of South Carolina, Arnold School of Public Health in 2014 and her MPH at
                           the University of Georgia, College of Public Health in 2009. Her general research
                           interests are in Bayesian methods, fMRI brain imaging analysis, bioinformatics (epigenetics)
                           and semi-parametric modeling. Her primary research focuses on methods for identifying
                           significant regions of brain activation using fMRI meta-data and methods for identifying
                           associations of DNA methylation with outcomes of interest.
