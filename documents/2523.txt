                        Studies is not an "apprenticeship" program that dictates a single career pathway.
                        Though the IS major can provide you with useful knowledge and skills that many organizations
                        may find desirable, your major is only a portion of what makes you employable.
                     
                     
                     Thus a more productive way to approach this issue is to examine:
                     
                     
                        
                        "What do I want to do for a career? What types of work do I find exciting and/or engaging?"
                        
                        "Will an IS major help me obtain the necessary tools for this career?"
                        
                        "Do I enjoy my field of study? Do I find the courses intellectually challenging and
                           stimulating?"
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     In other words, your choice of major should be examined in light of your long-term
                        goals, the relevance of your major towards attaining these goals, and your personal
                        interest in the subject matter. Towards that end, the links below provide further
