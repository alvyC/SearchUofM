                     The University of Memphis is committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment
                           for students, faculty, staff and visitors with disabilities. In compliance with the
                           Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
                           1973 (Section 504), no qualified individual with a disability shall be discriminated
                           against or excluded from consideration for employment or participation in or the benefits
                           of the services, programs or activities of the University of Memphis.
                     
                     Under the ADA and Section 504, a person is considered to have a disability if (1)
                        he or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more
                        major life activities (such as hearing, seeing, speaking, breathing, performing manual
                        tasks, walking, caring for oneself, learning, or concentrating); (2) has a record
                        of having such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment class.
                        The University provides reasonable and appropriate accommodations to students and
                        employees with disabilities.
