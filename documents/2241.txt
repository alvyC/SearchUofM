                     The Fogelman College of Business & Economics offers three specialized master’s degrees
                        to students wanting to gain advanced knowledge in a particular area. Unlike the MBA,
                        which is a general master’s degree, these degrees allow the student to study in-depth
                        in their chosen area of specialty
                     
                     
                     The Master of Science with the major in Business Administration has concentrations in Finance, Insurance and Real Estate and Real Estate Development. This MS degree offers students distinct specialization
                        in their chosen concentration area.
                     
                     
                     The Master of Science in Information Systems (formerly MSBA in MIS) degree provides its students with courses that contain the
                        core content of all information systems programs, with the content directed toward
                        managerial-level activities.
                     
                     
                     The Master of Science in Accounting provides students wishing to specialize in accounting the opportunity to concentrate
                        in one of three areas: general accounting, healthcare accounting, and taxation.
                     
                     
                     The Master of Arts in Economics provides advanced training in economics for students who are interested in continuing
                        their graduate education with the PhD in Economics or who are interested in a career
                        as an economic analyst in the private sector or in government organizations.
