                     The Department of Art educates students in the visual arts and design from a holistic
                        perspective: practical, theoretical, and historical. Whether focusing in studio, art
                        history, art education, or graphic design, undergraduate and graduate students develop
                        a creative voice and professional practice through the cultivation of skill, critical
                        analysis, and an understanding of art's evolution over time and place.
                     
                     
                     Memphis has a deeply rooted, well-known cultural history as fertile ground for world-changing
                        creative expression in art, music, and literature. Located in the center of the city,
                        the Department of Art critically engages this heritage as a sourcefor its own identity
                        and inspiration, while at the same time taking up broader contemporary issues and
                        questions from a global perspective.
                     
                     
                     Interwoven within a major metropolitan university, the Department of Art is made up
                        of a diverse range of students whose racial, ethnic, cultural andeconomic backgrounds
                        contribute to a broader research university community and curriculum where experimentation
                        and innovation are paramount. Diversity, interdisciplinarity, and creative expression
                        are central to cultivating socially directed and ethically responsible artistic leaders
                        for the 21st century.
                     
                     
                     MISSION
                     
                     The University of Memphis Department of Art is a diverse community of students, teachers,

                        and professional practice through the cultivation of skill, critical analysis, and
                        an understanding of art's evolution over time and place. Embedded in an urban environment
                        with a deeply rooted cultural history as fertile ground for world-changing creative
                        expression, as well as a major metropolitan research university that addresses broad
                        contemporary issues from an informed global perspective, the Department of Art critically
                        engages heritage, diversity, and interdisciplinarity as foundational for the cultivation
                        of socially aware and ethically responsible artistic leaders for the 21st exhibitions,
                        lectures, research and publications, the department both advocates for the visual
                        arts and enriches the university and surrounding communities.
