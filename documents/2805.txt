                     Promoting Chinese language and culture in the Mid-South.
                     
                     CIUM proudly offers and participates in various programs to promote the Chinese language
                        and culture throughout the Mid-South area. We are proud to be the only Confucius Institute
                        with a bachelor's degree program of Asian Studies and International Trade (ASIT).
                        We have partnered with Hubei University to offer a comprehensive study-abroad program,
                        whereby our ASIT students have the extraordinary opportunity to learn in China.
                     
                     
                     In addition to offering the degree program of Asian Studies and International Trade,
                        we have partnerships with various public and private K-12 schools. We offer assistance
                        in setting up a Chinese language program in these schools to help children learn a
                        foreign language at as early an age as possible.
                     
                     
                     One of our programs sponsored by our parent organization, Hanban, offers a Chinese
                        Summer Bridge Camp for High School Students. Through this program, high school students
                        in the surrounding area are able to apply for a trip to China for a 2 1/2 week visit.
                        During this summer camp, students are taught the Chinese language, exposed to various
                        traditional foods, as well as travel to various landmarks throughout their stay. We
                        are proud to be a partner in our community through these programs. To learn more,
