                     Abhijit's work under Prof. Dipankar Dasgupta is titled "Design and Implementation of an Adaptive Multi-factor Authentication(A-MFA)
                        Framework." Multi-factor authentication is currently an urgent need to facilitate
                        continuous protection of computing devices and other critical online services from
                        an unauthorized access. Many authentication mechanisms with varying degrees of detection
                        rate of users and portability are available for different types of computing devices.
                        Hence, the adoption of a multi-factor strategy in authentication process provides
                        a flexible solution to the users as well as protecting their identity. This research
                        focuses on designing and developing a trustworthy model for the authentication factors
                        (modalities and their features) based on different types of operating devices and
                        connected media. Moreover, a novel probabilistic approach capable of adaptive and
                        non-repetitive selection of different authentication factors (for a set of devices
                        and media) is also proposed in the research. This selection approach also considers
                        their (different factors) computational complexity, trustworthy values, performance
                        in authentication selection, and previous use of the selected modalities in the same
                        settings. The trustworthy values derived from the proposed trustworthy model are the
                        guiding factors for adaptive selection of the authentication factors with the consideration
                        of the effects of surroundings (light, noise, etc.) on different categories of devices
                        and media. Empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed selection approach performs
                        better than other selection strategies in different environmental settings.
                     
                     
                     Daqing's work under Prof. Chase Wu is titled "Technologies and Tools for Synthesis of Source-to-Sink High-performance
                        Flows: Transport Profile Generation." The transfer of big data is increasingly supported
                        by dedicated channels in high-performance networks. Transport protocols play a critical
                        role in maximizing the link utilization of such high-speed long-haul connections.
                        The optimal operational zones of such recently proposed transport protocols such as
                        UDT are affected by many factors and their default values do not always yield the
                        best performance. In addition, scientific application users typically do not have
                        the knowledge to choose which transport protocol to use and which parameter value
                        to set. This work proposes a Transport Profile Generator (TPG) to characterize and
                        enhance the end-to-end throughput performance of transport protocols. TPG automates
                        the tuning of various transport-related parameters including socket options and protocol-specific
                        configurations, and supports multiple data streams and multiple NIC-to-NIC connections.
                        TPG optimizes CPU affinity settings of sending/receiving threads in multi-core system
                        by exploring the internal connectivity/topology of various hardware components (cores,
                        sockets, NICs, etc.) through interfacing with the Host Profiler provided by ORNL.
                        TPG also provides profiling API functions to be called by other tools such as XDD
                        to improve the data movement performance. To instantiate the design of TPG, this research
                        uses UDT and TCP as examples in the implementation and conducts extensive experiments
                        of big data transfer over high-speed network channels to illustrate how existing transport
                        protocols benefit from TPG in optimizing the throughput performance.
