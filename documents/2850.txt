                     2. Retention in STEM for First-time, Fulltime Freshmen at the UofM
                     
                     First-time, fulltime freshmen are more likely to be retained in a STEM major since
                        the onset of MemphiSTEM in 2008. Students are more likely to remain in a STEM major
                        after two and three years and be retained or graduate after four years (Table 2).

                     Results from an analysis comparing MemphiSTEM students (UofM students taking part
                        in MemphiSTEM activities) to a group of control students (UofM STEM majors not participating
                        in MemphiSTEM activities) indicate MemphiSTEM students are more likely to be retained
                        or graduate in a STEM major and attain a higher GPA than control students (Table 3).
