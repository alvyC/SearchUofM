                     Eye on the Struggle : ETHEL PAYNE, THE FIRST LADY OF THE BLACK PRESS, BY JAMES MCGRATH MORRIS, WAS NAMED
                           THE 2015 HOOKS INSTITUTE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER!
                     
                     Morris' biography excavates the story of Ethel Payne, a journalist whose work for
                           the Chicago Defender during her multi-decade career provided a lens to thousands of
                           African-American readers into the action of the civil rights movement and beyond.
                           Covering the school desegregation crisis in Little Rock, interviewing black troops
                           in Vietnam or quizzing multiple presidents during her years at the White House, Payne's
                           career demonstrated the role journalists could play both in helping to build a movement
                           by informing the public and in furthering that movement by putting pointed questions
                           to those in power. Morris traces the narrative of Payne's career and adds insight into her personal experiences
                           as a pioneering black woman in the press. In so doing, the book shines a light on
                           the crucial role of the black press during the civil rights movement and enlarges
                           the field of movement icons to include a less obvious piece of the larger political
                           struggle.
                     
                     James McGrath Morris will visit the UofM to speak about Eye on the Struggle on November
                        15 at 6 PM.

                     Throughout the year, the University of Memphis and the Hooks Institute will hold a
                           series of events designed to bring students, faculty, and staff from the University
                           together with members of the Memphis community to address issues of social justice
                           and change. As most events are planned, they will be added here.
