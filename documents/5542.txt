            Policy Statement
        
    




    
        
             
            Any
                    type of agreement that obligates the University to provide payment, 
                    services, goods or use of University properties, facilities or 
                    other resources to an external party (hereinafter “contracts”) must be 
                    signed by the President or designee.  Only the President and those 
                    specific individuals authorized in this policy or in writing by the 
                    President, through published policies or other authorizing documents, 
                    have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the University. 
                    The Vice President for Business and Finance shall be responsible for the
                    development and administration of procedures to ensure compliance with 
                    this policy.
                Contracts which are not on University of Memphis standard forms must 
                    be reviewed by the Office of Legal Counsel, Business Services 
                    or Research Support Services before being signed by an authorized 
                    University official. Individuals who execute contracts that are not authorized to do so may be personally liable for the obligations of the contract.     
        
    




    
        
            
            Purpose

                    describe the requirements, procedures, and approval processes 
                    for University contracts and to define the delegation of 
                    authority deemed necessary and appropriate for the efficient 
                    administration of the University. This policy applies to 
                    all contracts that legally bind the University of Memphis 
                    other than regular full-time faculty and staff employment 
                    contracts.  This policy also complies with Tennessee Board of 
                    Regents (TBR) Policy No.1:03:02:10, "Approval of Agreements," and TBR 
                    Guideline G-030, "Contracts and Agreements.

            Contract Procedures
            Employees
                    are encouraged to use the University standard contracts to 
                    expedite the contracting process.  The University standard 
                    contracts are located at  http://bf.memphis.edu/forms/admin.php . 
                    All proposed contracts, even those using the standard form, must 
                    be reviewed by the department chair/activity head and University 
                    official responsible for monitoring the contract.  A Contract 
                    Agreement Routing form must be filled out and signed by the 
                    appropriate department official. ( http://bf.memphis.edu/forms/procurement/routing.html ) 
                    The contract and signed Contract Agreement Routing form should 
                    then be forwarded to the Director of Procurement and 
                    Contract Services for processing and signature.  For all 
                    non-competitive (sole source) contracts, a justification for sole 
                    source must accompany the routing form and contract.  The
                    Justification for Sole Source form is available on the Procurement and 
                    Contract Services web site. ( http://bf.memphis.edu/forms/procurement/sole.html )
                All expenditure and revenue contracts are initially reviewed by 
                    Procurement and Contract Services and may not require review by the
                    Office of Legal Counsel before signature. Vendor-generated contracts 
                    are initially reviewed by Procurement and Contract Services 
                    but will require additional time for review by the Office of Legal 
                    Counsel.   Specific non-standard contracts (real property 
                    leases, partnerships, performance agreements) are initially reviewed by 
                    Business Services.  All other non-standard contracts (memorandum of
                    understanding, business associates, etc.) are initially reviewed by the
                    Office of Legal Counsel. 
                If the President's approval is required, the Office of Legal Counsel 
                    and/or the Vice President for Business and Finance will forward the 
                    contract to the President after review.  All necessary signature 
                    approval lines should be added to the contract by the department, 
                    including that for the University.

            The following guidelines apply to contracts between the University of Memphis and any external party.
                
                    The listed positions below may approve an expenditure for 
                        Personal, Professional, or Consulting Service contracts when the total

                        Individuals or Contractor form is used ( http://bf.memphis.edu/forms/acct/acct06.htm ).   The completed form shall be forwarded to the Accounting Office for further processing.

                    Contracts of $5,000 or more require the approval of the Director of Procurement and Contract Services.
                    All proposed contracts of $10,000 or more must be competitively bid unless adequate "sole source" justification is provided.
                    All proposed contracts shall be approved by all parties prior to the effective start date.
                    If the other party or contractor is a corporation, its name must
                        be stated in the contract exactly as it appears in its charter. The 
                        person signing on behalf of the corporation must have legal authority to
                        do so, and his/her title/position should be shown on the signature 
                        page. If the other party is a state agency, signature approval lines are
                        necessary for the Department Commissioner or official of equivalent 
                        rank.

                        this policy (see below) must sign all University contracts. The 
                        authority to sign contracts cannot be delegated.
                    The Chancellor must sign certain contracts in conformance with this policy.
                    Prior approval of Fiscal Review Committee is required for 
                        all non-competitive (i.e., "sole source") contracts of a total value 
                        of $250,000 or more, and for a term greater than one (1) 
                        year.  This process requires submission to Fiscal Review Committee 
                        at least 75 calendar days prior to the effective start date.
                
                All proposed contracts must be reviewed and agreed to by 
                    the department chair/activity head or higher and the Director of 
                    Procurement and Contract Services before the contract will be 
                    approved by the President or other authorized officials.  Please
