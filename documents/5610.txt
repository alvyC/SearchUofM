                     ACADEMIC LOGO + WEDGE DESIGN
                     
                     The UofM "wedge" is intended primarily as a container for the University of Memphis
                        academic logo on materials where the primary background is white. While the colors,
                        position and orientation of the wedge may be altered (within guidelines) to suit their
                        application, the pitch/angle (68.5˚) of the wedge and its overall size relative to
                        the academic logo and wordmark should remain consistent with these examples and the
                        working files provided. The side of the UofM wedge that does not end in an angle should
                        bleed off of the page, when possible.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     WEDGE AND PINSTRIPE GRAPHIC EXAMPLES
                     
                     The pinstripe graphic may be used in conjunction with the wedge design for headlines,
                        callouts and other treatments to add visual interest where needed.
                     
                     
                     When resizing these elements, the size, width and scale of the pinstripes relative
                        to the wedge should be maintained. When height-adjusting, the pinstripes should be
                        adjusted to maintain an acceptable width between stripes, with the goal of avoiding
                        stripes that are either too close together or too far apart. The optimal stroke width
                        for the pinstripe element is 0.25 points for printed materials. The point size may
                        be adjusted for oversized print situations. 
                     
                     
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     WEDGE DESIGN: OTHER USES
                     
                     Larger wedge designs may be used to contain headlines, body text or additional graphics
                        (e.g., sponsorship logos or photos) when needed.
                     
                     
                     Usage examples of the larger wedge design are shown below. The wedge design should
                        be used for emphasis and to create hierarchy. Be mindful of overusing the wedge as
                        a design element in individual pieces. 
                     
                     
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     COPY ABBREVIATION USAGE
                     
                     For the sake of brevity and colloquialism, "University of Memphis" is often shortened.
                        In this event, there should be no spaces between any of letters; it should appear
                        as UofM. When used in a headline with all uppercase letters, the "of" in UofM should
                        still be lowercase. Examples:
