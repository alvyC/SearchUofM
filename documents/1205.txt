Club Leadership


    President: Jennifer Archibald (BS '06)


Meet Jennifer:
I was born and raised in Memphis and grew up a die-hard Tigers fan. After graduating
from Memphis in 2006 with a degree in Sport Management, I worked and traveled with
my job before deciding to pursue a graduate degree. In 2013, I moved to New Orleans
and enrolled in the University of New Orleans. I completed my Masters in Hospitality
and Tourism Management in December 2014. I fell in love with the city and decided
to stay.  Now I’m an academic counselor in the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies
at UNO. But don’t worry. I will forever bleed blue. Go Tigers Go!
