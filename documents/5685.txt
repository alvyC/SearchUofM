                     Tennessee Board of Regents Approves Lowest Tuition Hike for UofM in 18 Years
                     
                     June 22, 2015 - The Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) today approved increases in tuition
                        and fees for the University of Memphis that are the lowest since 1997. This follows
                        a year where the UofM held tuition flat.
                     
                     
                     At the University of Memphis, undergraduate tuition will increase 3.7 percent, or
                        $11 per credit hour; graduate tuition will increase 3.9 percent, or $18 per credit
                        hour; and law tuition will increase 2 percent, or $15 per credit hour. There will
                        be no additional increase for out-of-state students.
                     
                     
                     This increase is less than half of the 8 percent average increase in tuition at the
                        UofM over the last 15 years.
                     
                     
                     "The Tennessee Board of Regents and the University of Memphis remain committed to
                        providing a high-quality education at an affordable cost," said President M. David
                        Rudd. "We are able to minimize the increase because of continuing cost containment
                        and efficiency measures."
                     
                     
                     Today's announcement means that undergraduate in-state students taking a full academic
                        course load of 12 hours will pay $7,320 per year, plus mandatory fees of $1,583. In-state
                        graduate students taking at least ten hours will pay $9,580 a year, plus mandatory
                        fees of  $1,589. Students in the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law will pay $16,312
                        plus $1,475 in mandatory fees.
