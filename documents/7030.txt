                     Degree Requirements
                     
                     The 48-hour program of study is divided into three parts as follows:
                     
                     Core Curriculum (24 hours):
                     
                     These courses are required of all students in the program and provide knowledge and
                        skills essential to the discipline. With previous training or experience, credit by
                        examination can be given for a portion of the required courses.
                     
                     
                     Focused Electives (18-21 hours):
                     
                     A bundle of electives provide the student with a sequence of special interest courses
                        chosen from throughout the University. The 18 hours of electives allow the student
                        to extend basic knowledge gained in the core curriculum and can include such subjects
                        as economic development planning, urban design, land use and transportation planning,
                        planning information systems, housing and community development planning, planning
                        law, environmental planning, etc. Electives are chosen in consultation with a faculty
                        advisor.
                     
                     
                     Terminal Project Requirement  (3 or 6 hours):
                     
                     Students have two options for meeting the Terminal Project requirement: an individual
                        capstone research option or a group studio option.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Terminal Project Option 1. Students who wish to pursue individual research can complete a 3-hour Capstone Project,
                           submitted as a written report and orally defended, as a terminal experience designed
                           to demonstrate mastery of planning process and substance.
                        
                        
                        Terminal Project Option 2. Students seeking more community engagement opportunities and experience in field-work
                           and group development of planning policies and interventions can complete two additional
                           studio courses for a total of six (6) hours from among PLAN 6801 Design Collaborative
                           Studio or PLAN 7007 Project Planning Studio.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     A comprehensive examination must be successfully completed by the end of the semester
                        in which the student expects to graduate.
                     
                     
                     Sequence of Courses
                     
                     The sequence of courses is designed so that a student may be admitted to the program
                        during either the fall or spring semester. A full-time student enrolls in 12 hours
                        of course work during each semester. A majority of the core courses are offered during
                        the first year to provide a basis for second year electives. The second year Comprehensive
                        Planning Studio (7006) is a workshop course for the application of basic principles
                        learned during the first year. The typical sequence of courses for a full-time student
                        who starts the program in the fall semester is outlined below:

                     Participation in the Planning Innovations Technology (PIT) lab is a common requirement
                        for all first-year fall core courses. PIT lab sessions are designed to incorporate
                        the development of technology-based skills sets into the curriculum. These 3-hour
                        sessions are held on Friday afternoons. Full-time students participate in common weekly
                        PIT lab sessions during the fall of the first-year. Part time students are required
                        to participate in selected PIT lab sessions.
