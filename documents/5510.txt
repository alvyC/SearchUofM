                     Autism Certificate Program
                     
                     The University of Memphis is excited to offer an online Autism Certificate Program
                        beginning summer 2014.  The Autism Certificate Program is designed to equip parents,
                        teachers, and professionals with the tools necessary to successfully work with children
                        with autism and deal with the unique challenges and rewards associated with the disorder.
                        This four course certificate can be completed over one summer (two first term classes;
                        two second term classes) and is perfect for anyone wanting to learn a practical approach
                        to every day concerns related to a diagnosis of Autism. The program will provide students
                        with the opportunity to expand their knowledge base related to working with individuals
                        and families affected by Autism.
