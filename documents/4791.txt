		When we met on November 12, I promised to let all of those whose positions were analyzed but determined to be functional rather than ITS positions know of that status.  I sent those emails out on November 19.  If you have any questions about your status, please contact me via email or phone.
Thanks,
Ellen

		Frequently Asked Questions – ITS Organization

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		Q.  What is the purpose of the ITS realignment?

To create efficiencies
To eliminate redundancies
To cross-train for improved support

Q.  Are there going to be other changes across the        University ?

Yes, all units are examining opportunities to reduce costs, improve services, and increase efficiencies.

Q.  Will there be more changes in ITS?  

Yes.  We will continue to evolve as conditions warrant and to meet the needs of the University.

Q.   Who will manage integrated technology personnel?

  ITS

Q.     Could I be reassigned to a different supervisor? 

Yes, we are moving to a resource management model that may require a change in supervisors based on the work necessary to meet the needs of the University.

Q.    Who will perform evaluations of integrated technology personnel?    

The ITS manager/ supervisor assigned to the unit will evaluate integrated technology personnel based on job performance, skills, and customer service feedback, using the University’s annual performance evaluation process. Deans will be asked for input on evaluations.

Q.     Will the same people support the same areas? 

Yes and no. In the short term, there will be few changes.  ITS will implement cross-training initiatives to strengthen support across campus.  For the long term, we will practice resource management by pooling personnel to complete tasks and projects.

Q.     Where will the ITS staff be located? 

A few staff locations, including LSPs, will change locations in the short term. We will continue to have staff located throughout the campus.

Q.     How will the realignment affect support hours? 

We have after-hours support until 7:00 p.m. at this time and will be extending to cover academic needs as necessary.

Q.    Are other divisions participating in the ITS integration?  

Not at this time.

Q.    How will customers request assistance? 

Customers should call 8888 or fill out a ticket at helpdesk.memphis.edu.

		Update on ITS Organizational Structure

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		As we discussed today (11/12/13), you will find below two documents:

The conceptual model for ITS – the way we do business, effective today

ITS-conceptual-model-20131108

The simplified traditional organizational chart – the core teams for leave requests and approvals, performance management, and other administrative tasks, effective today

  ITS-organizational-model-20131108
Open positions will be posted within the next couple of days — please review them and apply for any in which you are interested.
Robert and Sue will meet with groups and individuals on an on-going basis to make the new model operational.  As soon as the leadership team has its full complement of members, more detailed alignments of staff and duties will be developed.
As you consider your role in the new ITS, please begin to develop your performance goals and objectives in light of the new model.  Remember that your performance plan must include at least one measurable customer service goal, and at least one measurable team/group goal.
As Robert, Sue and I all said this morning, we have confidence in your skills and your commitment to UoM, and look forward to working with you on all of the initiatives, functions, and services in which ITS is engaged.

		ITS Organizational Update

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		Colleagues,
When we met with you July 11, we announced the integration of central and Academic Affairs IT functions, services, and personnel, with a planned integration timeline of 90 days.  We understand the anxiety created by this effort, and we have been working diligently to move this effort forward.  As you can imagine, an integration on this scale is complicated.  Not only must we consider current functions and services, but we must also work strategically to identify the University’s future needs.
Our recommendations regarding the organizational structure are complete.  We are currently awaiting approval of those recommendations and will provide more details as soon as possible.
In the meantime, we appreciate your continued work in providing essential services and excellent customer services. 
Thanks for your patience and support.
Ellen
