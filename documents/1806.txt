                     Hearst Foundations Award $100,000 to Support First-Generation College Students at
                        UofM
                     
                     
                     May 10, 2016 - The University of Memphis has received a $100,000 grant from The Hearst
                        Foundations for the First Scholars program. The Hearst Foundations identify and fund
                        outstanding nonprofits to ensure that people of all backgrounds have the opportunity
                        to build healthy, productive and inspiring lives. First Scholars advances the work
                        of the Hearst Foundations through its focus on increasing the graduation rate for
                        first-generation college students.
                     
                     
                     Nationally, only 36 percent of first-generation students complete a bachelor's degree
                        within six years of enrollment, compared with 60 percent of their peers whose parents
                        are college graduates. Students selected to participate in the four-year First Scholars
                        program benefit from peer mentoring, personalized academic and social support, and
                        a $5,000 annual scholarship. The grant from The Hearst Foundations will fund scholarships
                        for 10 new participants for two years.
                     
                     
                     "First Scholars is a remarkably effective program that addresses a critical need at
                        the University," said UofM President M. David Rudd. "Students who are the first in
                        their family to attend college face numerous obstacles to success, and often lack
                        the experience and support they need to overcome those obstacles."
                     
                     
                     At the UofM, 42 percent of full-time undergraduates are first-generation compared
                        to about 20 percent of full-time undergraduates nationally at four-year institutions.
                        "The data show that students who participate in First Scholars are being provided
                        with the tools they need to achieve at a high level and earn their degrees," added
                        Rudd. "The Hearst Foundations commitment will ensure that more students find success."
                     
                     
                     Launched with a grant from the Suder Foundation, the First Scholars program has reached
                        a landmark year with the first cohort of participants who arrived on campus in fall
                        2012 set to graduate in 2016. The program has demonstrated success with a four-year
                        graduation rate of 42 percent, which is more than three times the rate for all first-generation
                        students at the UofM, and an overall retention rate of 86 percent. The cumulative
                        GPA for all participants is 3.19.
