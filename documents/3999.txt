                     *Foreign language courses are an additional requirement for the Associate of Arts
                        (A.A.) and Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees. The B.A. degree requires proficiency in
                        a foreign language equivalent to completion of two years of college-level work. The
                        A.A. degree requires proficiency in a foreign language equivalent to completion of
                        one year of college-level work.
                     
                     
                     **Six hours of English Composition and three hours in English oral presentational
                        communication are required.
                     
                     
                     ****Students who have not completed one year of American History in high school must
                        complete 6 credit hours of American History or 3 credit hours of American History
                        plus 3 credit hours of Tennessee History in order to satisfy the History General Education
                        requirement. Students who plan to transfer to University of Tennessee System universities
                        or to out-of-state or private universities should check requirements and take the
                        appropriate courses.
                     
                     
                     Although the courses designated by Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) institutions to
                        fulfill the requirements of the general education subject categories vary, transfer
                        of the courses is assured through the following means:
                     
                     
                     • Upon completion of an A.A. or A.S. degree, the requirements of the lower-division
                        general education core will be complete and accepted by a TBR university in the transfer
                        process. • If an A.A. or A.S. is not obtained, transfer of general education courses will be
                        based upon fulfillment of complete subject categories. (Example: If all eight hours
                        in the category of Natural Sciences are complete, then this “block” of the general
                        education core is complete.) When a subject category is incomplete, course-by-course
                        evaluation will be conducted. The provision of block fulfillment pertains also to
                        students who transfer among TBR universities. • Institutional/departmental requirements of the grade of “C” will be honored. Even
                        if credit is granted for a course, any specific requirements for the grade of “C”
                        by the receiving institution will be enforced. • In certain majors, specific courses must be taken also in general education. It
                        is important that students and advisors be aware of any major requirements that must
                        be fulfilled under lower-division general education.
                     
                     
                     Courses designated to fulfill general education at the University of Memphis are published
                        below. A complete listing of the courses fulfilling general education requirements
                        for all system institutions is available on the TBR website ( http://www.tbr.edu/ ) under Transfer and Articulation Information.

                     All students are required to apply to graduate during the semester preceding the semester
                        of graduation. The deadlines for the application to graduate are included on the Registrar's website . It is the responsibility of the student to insure that this deadline is met.
