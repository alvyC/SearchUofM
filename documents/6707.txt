                        the cost is charged to the faculty's development account. The following procedures
                        have been devised to guide the delivery of the various services that Faculty Services
                        Center offers.

                     Procedure For Duplicating Instructional Material
                     
                     A copy order form has to be filled out for each copy assignment. This form has to
                        be filled out COMPLETELY. Please count the number of pages, enter the number of copies
                        you want, one-sided, two-sided, collated/stapled, etc. This is a major time saver
                        if we have all of this information as soon as we get the order. If we have a question
                        and cannot reach the faculty member, the order could be delayed several hours.
                     
                     
                     Equipment
                     
                     Faculty Services provides computer/projectors and TV/VCRs for classrooms that do not
                        have this technology. However, our supply is very limited and reservations must be
                        made in advance of your scheduled presentations. This equipment may be picked up and
                        returned, or FSC will deliver and pick up. If you see that you are not going to need
                        the equipment, PLEASE let FSC know as soon as possible. This not only relieves our
                        office of delivering it to the classroom, but also, it makes the equipment available
                        for someone who may need it at that time.
                     
                     
                     MAIL
                     
                     Incoming Mail From Outside The College
                     
                     
                     All incoming mail from outside the college is delivered to the mailroom in the Dean's
                        Office. Mail will be sorted into the appropriate boxes as a first step in distribution.
                        Mail slots are identified for UG, Master and Ph.D. program as well as for computer
                        support and Technological Advancement functions. Once the initial sorting and distribution
                        is complete, the Faculty Services Center staff will pick up the mail to distribute
                        to individual, locked faculty mail boxes in the faculty mail room located in room
                        212. All doctoral student and part-time instructor mail will be distributed into individual
                        mail boxes also located in room 100. Faculty Service Center will deliver mail at least
                        once a day as a regular practice Monday thru Friday. Mail that is large in size and
                        does not fit into mail boxes will be kept in the Faculty services Center and the individual
                        recipient will be notified by voice mail. In cases of bulk mail or mail that is in
                        large numbers (e.g., surveys, etc.) special arrangements should be made in advance
                        with the Faculty Services Center. Accumulated mail for the faculty with extended leaves
                        will be placed in their offices once their mail boxes are filled, unless arrangements
                        for mail pick up are made by the individual faculty member.
                     
                     
                     Outgoing Mail
                     
                     Faculty may drop outgoing mail at the Faculty Service Center, room FCB 350, the Faculty
                        Mail room, room 320, or the mail room in the Dean's Office, room FCB 430A. The outgoing
                        mail will be sorted by FSC staff. All outgoing mail must be identified by the individual
                        sender's name. Faculty Service Center staff will sort and deliver the outgoing mail
                        to the mailroom in the Dean's office to be picked up by the postal service. Large
                        quantity mailing requests must be submitted to the Faculty service Center in advance
                        so that appropriate arrangements can be made. FedEx and Priority Mail envelopes and
                        address labels are provided in FSC.
                     
                     
                     From Inside The College
                     
                     Faculty may send material to other faculty and students either by dropping the material
                        in the designated location within the Faculty Service Center or Faculty Mail Room.
                        (FCB 320) There is a large closed mail container in the Faculty Mail Room for this
                        purpose. Materials left in this container will be distributed as part of the regular
                        mail service. Faculty, Teaching Assistants and Part-time faculty should provide full
                        information to their students and the FSC about how they can be reached by the students
                        at the beginning of each semester. Information to students should include office hours,
                        office numbers, phone numbers and information about locations for students to drop
                        off material for their instructor. All such information should be provided as part
                        of course syllabi and posted on the office door.
                     
                     
                     Procedures for Keys
                     
                     All keys are checked out through Faculty Services. Office keys, mailbox keys and various
                        building keys will remain with you, but certain classroom keys which you will need
                        should be returned at the end of each semester. This is extremely important. If these
                        keys are not turned in, it causes a shortage for the following semester.
                     
                     
                     If you want your graduate assistant to have a key to your office, you must let FSC
                        know in advance. The key will be checked out in your name and you will be responsible
                        for it. If you do not want your GA to have a key, but want him to have access to your
                        office, you must inform FSC in advance. We will not let anyone into your office without
                        prior notice.
                     
                     
                     Lost Keys
                     
                     If you lose your keys, they will be replaced, but please make every effort to find
                        them before requesting new ones. A yearly key audit is conducted in early Fall. You
                        must account for all keys that have been issued to you during the year.
                     
                     
                     Handouts and Other Materials
                     
                     Faculty are encouraged to use library services to place class material on reserve.
                        Such material may include articles, various handouts, and copies of transparencies
                        used in the class. Faculty Services Center cannot duplicate copyrighted material without
                        documented proper approval. FSC will produce overhead transparencies (provided that
                        templates are ready for copying) and class handouts that require immediate distribution.
                        These requests will be handled on a first-come-first serve basis. To ensure timely
                        processing, requests should be submitted at least one (1) day in advance.
                     
                     
                     TEST MATERIALS
                     
                     Test materials must be turned in at least 24 hours prior to the time needed. It is
                        imperative that the work request form be completed. Please fill out all information
                        required to avoid delays in processing.
