                        Memphis CIBER Established in 1989, Memphis CIBER is the only CIBER located in the Lower Mississippi Delta region-an area encompassing
                           most of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana and parts of Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri,
                           and Tennessee. Characterized by serious limitations on human and economic resources
                           and a provincial mindset wary of change, the Delta region contains some of the poorest
                           counties in the United States
                        
                        
                        Since its inception, Memphis CIBER has systematically worked to develop a continuum
                           of programs designed to globalize the thinking and activities of students, faculty,
                           and business in the Lower Mississippi Delta while contributing to national competitiveness
                           goals. Core programs are continually refined to respond to emerging needs and growth
                           opportunities while maintaining their focus on the region's unique needs.
                        
                        
                        CIBER began its efforts focused on affecting institutional change at The University
                           of Memphis. Results include the development and implementation of an International
                           MBA Program that significantly advanced institutional collaboration, resources, and
                           strategies for further internationalization efforts across academic disciplines.
