                     Star Rating...what does it mean?
                     
                     In a manner similar to the way that Netflix somehow knows what movies you might like,
                        Courses to Consider may help you make a choice between two equal course options.
                     
                     
                     Let's say you want to take a course to complete your General Education Humanities
                        requirement this semester. You don't know the difference between PHIL 1101 and ART
                        1030, and perhaps neither is of interest to you. Courses to Consider uses a LOT of
                        information, including how students like you have done in these courses, to make a
                        recommendation. Recommendations don't indicate how much you will LIKE a course, but
                        rather your possibility of academic SUCCESS.
                     
                     
                     What we found out after the Fall 2012 semester is that if you take a course which
                        is recommended with 4 or 5 stars, you are likely to be successful in the course. No
                        guarantees, of course, because success depends on your effort.
                     
                     
                     So what does "predictive analytics" mean for you? Look for the 4 or 5 star ratings
                        to make decisions between two equal choices!
