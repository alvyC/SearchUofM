                     About the Institute of Combinatorics
                     
                     
                     The combinatorics and graph theory group at the University of Memphis has been a unique,
                        highly productive and active research unit since the early 1970s when the group began
                        a
                        collaborative relationship with Paul Erdős .
                        This collaboration spanned two decades and resulted in the seminal members becoming
                        some of his
                        most frequent coauthors. The momentum continued with the establishment in 1995 of
                        the
                        Jabie Hardin Chair of Excellence
                           in Graph Theory and Combinatorics , together with a rotating visiting senior faculty position.
                        This has lead to an extremely effective group, both
                        in research and in the mentoring of the next generation of students for academic and
                        industry
                        research opportunities in this dynamic field.
                     
                     
                     The Institute of Combinatorics brings together faculty, visitors, postdocs, students,
                        and staff to provide a world class research group in combinatorics and graph theory.

                     The Erdős Lecture Series is a conference held almost every year at the University
                        of Memphis
                        in honor of the department's long relationship with Paul Erdős.
                     
                     
                     Unfortunately, due to funding difficulties, the 2015 Erdős Lecture Series was cancelled.
