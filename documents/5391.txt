    Why did we implement the Dining Dollars program?
    A committee made up of faculty, staff, and students was formed in 2008 to review dining options in higher education and make recommendations on the future of dining services on campus. Two recommendations were made:
        
        The Dining Dollars program would help engage undergraduate students in the university experience, which most often increases student involvement, resulting in higher retention rates and successful scholastic outcomes.
        Dining Dollars would allow the university to develop, with its food vendor, the dining program needed for the new University Center.
        
    
    
    How do the cash registers and vending machines differentiate between Dining Dollars and Tiger Funds?
    
        
        The cashier will ask if you will be using Dining Dollars or Tiger Funds.
        The vending machines will automatically deduct from Dining Dollars first. If Dining Dollars are not available, then it will deduct the purchase from Tiger Funds.
        
    
    
    If I don't meet the Dining Dollars program criteria, is there another option for me?
     
        Yes – Tiger Funds . Visit the Student Financial Services windows adjacent to 115 Wilder Tower on the main campus and request a Tiger Funds account. The Bursar's Office accepts cash, check, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express.
        You may also add Tiger Funds using a credit or debit card on the Campus Card website at www.memphis.edu/campuscard .
