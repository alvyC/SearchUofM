                     Once again, we welcome you to the University of Memphis and look forward to being
                        a part of your continued success as you join our team.
                     
                     
                     There are three phases of UMboarding:
                     
                     Phase I: New Employee Orientation
                     
                     During the face-to-face New Employee Orientation session, you will be able to meet
                        other new employees as well as learn about the University's history, its strategic
                        plan and how you will play an intricate part in moving the University towards becoming
                        a top research Institution. Amidst the course of the day, Workforce Management, Employee
                        Safety and Health, and Employee Benefits render pertinent information to ready you
                        for your benefits coverage and overall campus safety and awareness. Please consult our New Employee Resource Guide .
                     
                     
                     Phase II: On-boarding Event
                     
                     Approximately within three months of hiring, we invite all new employees to share
                        their experiences with us.
                     
                     
                     Phase III: Management Talk
                     
                     On a quarterly basis, the management team of new employees is brought together to
                        share the UMboarding process, the experience of new employees, and the expectations
                        for them to assist new employees in the University's culture.
