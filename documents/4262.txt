                           development of LIDA controlled agents in various domains. In addition to valuable
                           programming experience, a participant will learn the LIDA model and its architecture,
                           and may co-author a published research paper describing their work.

                     Project Description: Our research group focuses on earthquake simulations and the
                           prediction of earthquake effects. Research tasks for an undergraduate student in our
                           group will concentrate on helping develop computer tools to analyze results from simulations
                           and to compare simulation results with recorded data. In particular, we have several
                           ongoing projects that require the development of software to process results. We would
                           like these tools to be developed in Python. Therefore, we are looking for bright enthusiastic
                           minds willing to apply (and learn) programming skills to scientific research.  Support
                           for interested undergraduate students could extend beyond the Summer Honors program
                           if the student demonstrate abilities that are worth keeping in our group.
                     
                     Requirements for Student Applicants:
                     
                     In general, this project requires having good programming skills. Preference will
                           be give to someone with knowledge in Python, but we will consider someone who can
                           learn Python rapidly. We assume that if the student is already enrolled in the Honors
                           program, good academic record is understood as by default.
