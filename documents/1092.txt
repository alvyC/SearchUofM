                     Memphis-Based Startup May Provide Sweet Benefits for Those With Tooth Loss
                     
                     December 18, 2015 - To many people, honey is a sweet treat used for cooking and baking.
                        To SweetBio Inc., a Memphis-based biotech company, it's much more.
                     
                     
                     The medical device startup company, a graduate of the accelerator program ZeroTo510,
                        is commercializing a membrane with initial applications in oral surgeries to help
                        regenerate soft tissue and support bone growth as a requirement for restoration procedures.
                        SweetBio's unique membrane uses Manuka honey, which has antibacterial and wound-healing
                        properties that would be of great benefit during oral restoration surgeries.
                     
                     
                     SweetBio has raised more than $1 million to take its novel GTR (Guided Tissue Regeneration)
                        Membrane through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process. Investors
                        include Innova and MB Venture Partners.
                     
                     
                     It's estimated that by 2027, 200 million Americans will suffer partial tooth loss.
                        Without proper treatment and restoration, bacteria growth may cause oral infections,
                        which can lead to diabetes, heart and lung disease – even death. Dental clinicians
                        try to reduce these risks by installing a membrane as a barrier to allow the bone
                        and gums to heal before placing a dental implant. Current products are often difficult
                        to handle and may fail, reversing the healing process. SweetBio has licensed its patent-pending
                        technology from the University of Memphis to create a dissolvable membrane that uses
                        honey as a component to promote healing, combat infections and produce better outcomes.
                     
                     
                     Dr. Gary L. Bowlin and his team at the UofM developed the technology in the Tissue
                        Template Engineering and Regeneration Laboratory in the Department of Biomedical Engineering.
                        Dr. Isaac Rodriguez, co-founder and CEO of SweetBio, was a member of the team that
                        developed the patent-pending formulation.
                     
                     
                     "As a biomedical engineer focused on translational research, it is always exciting
                        and rewarding to watch your collaborative project develop from a clinician's need
                        into a product that will be sure to help improve quality of life issues," said Bowlin,
                        professor and Herbert Herff Chair of Excellence in Biomedical Engineering in the Herff
                        College of Engineering. "More rewarding is the aspect of watching an individual I
                        have mentored take the novel technology that we developed and lead commercialization,
                        as well as drive local economic development via a startup company mechanism with tremendous
                        support from the local business and investment community."
                     
                     
                     Dr. Jasbir Dhaliwal, the University's chief innovation officer, added, "The FedEx
                        Institute of Technology is pleased to have seeded the early development of this technology.
                        We will be accelerating the commercialization of more technologies and innovations
                        from the University's laboratories and research clusters. I am sure this success will
                        motivate other professors across campus to join this exciting innovation journey."
                     
                     
                     As a result of his innovations and their impact on the quality of life, Bowlin recently
                        was elected a 2015 Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors.
