                     The ADA and Accessibility
                     
                     The University is committed to ensuring equal access to its educational benefits and
                        opportunities. Therefore, the University provides the information on this page in
                        an effort to meet its goal of eliminating barriers for those with disabilities in
                        regard to accessing the programs, services and activities of the University.
                     
                     
                     Physical Access
                     
                     Individuals with disabilities need to be able to physically access UofM programs,
                        services and activities. Therefore, campus buildings, paths of travel, and other physical
                        facilities are to be accessible to the extent that no individual with a disability
                        is denied access to programs, services, or activities offered by UofM as a consequence
                        of inaccessible physical facilities. Those encountering an access barrier on the UofM
                        campus, may report it to the ADA Coordinator in the Office for Institutional Equity.

                     Web and Technical Accessibility
                     
                     Most people today can hardly imagine a life without the internet. However, web accessibility
                        is one of the most critical issues facing higher education. Web accessibility refers
                        to the practice of creating websites that are usable by people of all abilities or
                        disabilities. Following are some resources for ensuring compliance with web accessibility
                        as well as other technical components of your class or program.
