                           and performs theatre from diverse Southern perspectives and and celebrated its 20th
                           anniversary with a run on 42nd street for Summoners Ensemble Theatre in New York.
                        
                        
                        After a short stint with the Tennessee Titans, Alice returned to the University of

                        Alice's creative research is in narrative theatre, creating original work by adapting
                           and performing literature not originally meant for the stage. Performing for both
                           U.S. and international audiences, she has taken narrative theatre to three Edinburgh

                           Wyoming, Dijon, Strasbourg, and Paris. She has also been invited to and performed
                           in the narrative style in Palm Desert, California, and Homer, Anchorage, and Fairbanks,

                        One of Alice's greatest honors was performing the role of Mardy Murie in Place of Enchantment for Mrs. Murie, who is often called the Mother of Conservation, at the foot of the
                           Grand Tetons in honor of her 100th birthday.
