                        urban and regional problems. As such, planning is concerned with the spatial arrangement
                        and interaction of human activity systems in urbanized areas and enables the arrangement
                        of facilities and programs in an optimal and comprehensive way. As a professional

                        and regions toward desired objectives. Planning increases the effectiveness of public
                        and private decision-making by giving careful consideration to goal formulation, the
                        collection and organization of information and knowledge, and the design of policies
                        and programs. The curriculum is intended to provide the basic knowledge and skills
                        in theory, techniques, methods, and practice. The program is a full member of the

                        Planning Accreditation Board.
