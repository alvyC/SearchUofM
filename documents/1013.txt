                     The earlier you can involve us in your project, the more we can help. If you have
                        a good idea of what you need but don't have any ideas on how to get there, we can
                        work with you from concept development until finished product is delivered. If you
                        already know what you need, we still encourage you to work with us with an open mind
                        and/or take advantage of all the resources available in our Marketing Toolkit .
                     
                     
                     Some crucial elements to think through before beginning any project are as follows:
                     
                     
                        
                        Is the tactic absolutely necessary to achieve your goal? Does it justify the use of
                           resources (yours and ours)?
                        
                        
                        Proper lead time. In order to best help you we need the proper time to be able to
                           generate the work. Click HERE for planning timelines.

                        work, and the proposed date.
