                     While discussed extensively, very few studies have attempted to formally integrate
                     the notions of organizational strategy, competitive advantage, and the strategic use
                     of information technology. Utilizing the typology of Miles and Snow, this study attempts
                     to identify the strategic orientation (prospector, analyzer, defender) of widely cited
                     users of 'strategic information technology' before and after the launch of their innovative
                     systems. Also, measures of financial performance are compared between emergent groups
                     in order to determine if any particular strategic orientation consistently outperforms
                     the others. In general, this study reports four findings. First, it appears that strategic
                     users of information technology are not concentrated along a singular strategic dimension.
                     The firms examined in this study exhibited characteristics associated with each of
                     Miles and Snow's strategy types. Second, it seems that many firms shifted strategic
                     orientation after the launch of their systems. Interestingly, these shifts were rather
                     dramatic and seem to represent a fundamental change in strategic direction from earlier
                     'pre-system' operating philosophies. Third, case descriptions along with narratives
                     of annual reports suggest that usage or competitive intent of these strategic systems
                     matches the prevailing strategic profile of the initiating firms. In other words,
                     the systems seem to support organizational strategy. Finally, it seems that prospectors
                     and defenders realized significantly higher measures of financial performance immediately
                     after the implementation of 'strategic information technology'; however, in the long-term
                     no strategic orientation seemed to outperform the others.
