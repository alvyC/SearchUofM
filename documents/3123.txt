                     Reporting Overtime
                     
                     Overtime payment for biweekly-paid and temporary employees is calculated by the week.
                        However, overtime is reported for a two-week pay period.
                     
                     
                     Accrued time for overtime pay includes actual hours worked and holiday hours. Any
                        hours other than holiday hours and work hours are excluded from overtime compensation.
                        (e.g., sick and annual leave hours are excluded from overtime compensation.)
                     
                     
                     The time sheet totals hours as they are entered, it does not separate totals by the
                        week. Be cautious when entering overtime hours as the totals that accumulate may not
                        be a direct reflection of a single week in the pay period.
                     
                     
                     There are two types of overtime earnings:
                     
                     
                        
                        Straight Overtime (Overtime 1.0) After an employee has accrued 37.5 hours during a single work week, additional work
                           or holiday hours up to 40 hours during the same week will be compensated at straight-time
                           (regular rate of pay).
                        
                        
                        Premium Overtime (Overtime 1.5) When an employee has accrued 40 hours during any work week, additional work or holiday
                           hours during the same week will be compensated at premium time (one and one-half times
                           the regular rate of pay).
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Reporting Partial Hours
                     
                     University Policy states that hours are to be reported in tenths of hours; for example,
                        7.5, 4.3, 8.1. Use the following chart to as a guide to converting minutes to tenths
                        of an hour:
                     
                     
                     1 - 6 minutes = .1 hour 7 - 12 minutes = .2 hour 13 - 18 minutes = .3 hour 19 - 24 minutes = .4 hour 25 - 30 minutes = .5 hour 31 - 36 minutes = .6 hour 37 - 42 minutes = .7 hour 43 - 48 minutes = .8 hour 49 - 54 minutes = .9 hour 55 - 60 minutes = 1.0 hour
