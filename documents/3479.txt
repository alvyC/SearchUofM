                     Did you receive a scholarship from an entity outside of the University of Memphis
                           (UofM)? Congratulations!   Please follow these steps to have the scholarship credited to your account.
                       Was the check sent to you by the scholarship donor?
                     
                     
                        
                        Make sure that the scholarship check has your name and your UofM U ID number listed
                           on the Memo at the bottom of the check OR in any attached information that may accompany
                           the check. If you go by a nickname or your middle name, be sure to provide your legal
                           name.  
                        
                        
                        Check to see whether the check is written just to the UofM, or to both the UofM and
                           you. If your name is included in the “Pay to the Order of” line, you will need to
                           endorse the check by signing the back of it.
                        
                        
                         Make a copy of your award letter or any information included with the scholarship
                           check (such as a check stub). We will need a copy of this information, but you should
                           also keep a copy for your records.

                     What happens next?
                     
                     If you don’t see the scholarship applied to your UofM account as quickly as you expect,
                        please check with the donor to determine when the check was mailed. Allow at least
                        two weeks from this date for the check to arrive and be processed.   We will generally apply the scholarship to your account within three to five business
                        days. We may experience delays due to issues including, but not limited to, missing
                        signatures and other aid adjustments.   We will divide the scholarship into two equal portions for fall and spring, unless
                        the scholarship donor provides alternate instructions in an accompanying letter.   We will update to your financial aid awards to reflect receipt of the Outside Scholarship
                        Money so that you can see the scholarship has been applied. You can view this by following
                        these steps:
