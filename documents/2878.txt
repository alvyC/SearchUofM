        Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law-Street Law 
    


        Street Law is a student organization at the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law comprised of local law students, faculty and staff, and local practitioners. Nationally, Street Law dates back to 1972, when it was started as an outreach clinic at Georgetown Law School. Over the past four decades, Street Law has matured into an internationally-syndicated outreach program. At its core, Street Law is the following: a teaching program wherein law students are sent into community schools and the juvenile detention center to teach high school students age appropriate lessons in the law.
At Memphis, the law school administration and faculty, and local practicing lawyers, supervise law students (“Street Law Teachers”) who teach various aspects of the law and the legal profession to community youth (“Street Law Students”) at inner-city high schools in Memphis. Our chapter goal is to foster an interest in the legal profession among Street Law Students, effectively creating a long-term career development/mentorship pathway for aspiring lawyers. Secondly, Memphis’ Street Law program promotes goodwill between the Bar, various legal institutions, and the broader community by encouraging high school students to seriously study the effect of various legal rules and practices on their lives.
In the past year, Memphis’ Street Law program reached over 50 high school students (ages 14-18) over two years of teaching at The Soulsville Charter School, Freedom Preparatory High School, Hamilton High School, Central High School, and Grizzlies Preparatory School. Beyond the raw enrollment numbers for Street Law students in the target high schools, the positive impact and reach can be adduced from testimonials of high school college counselors and teachers, all of whom have given very positive feedback of the program and the Memphis law students who serve as Street Law Teachers
Your donation will help Street Law purchase textbooks and enable us to take the Street Law Students on various field trips to enhance their education. Any unused funds will be used the following year and to expand our reach in the community.
