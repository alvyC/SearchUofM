The University of Memphis Memberships and Subscriptions POLICIES

Issued:  March 13, 2014 Responsible Official:  Vice President for Business & Finance Responsible Office:  Accounting Office Policy Statement Policy Statement The University may be a member of an organization or maintain subscriptions if the membership or subscription is directly related to the goals and mission of the university.
The institution may not pay the membership dues or subscription of an individual.  An exception may be granted in instances where an organization does not permit institutional membership or where an individual membership (in the name of institutional representative) is less expensive than an institutional membership.  However, memberships necessary to maintain or enhance an employee's professional status (e.g. American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or Bar membership dues) should be considered the responsibility of the employee and the association dues considered a personal expense.
Where membership dues are included as a part or all of the expense of an organization meeting for which the institution pays the expense of an employee to attend, the appropriate expense shall be considered membership dues under these guidelines and should be subject to the established membership approval process.
University funds may not be used to pay for memberships in civic organizations or social clubs.
The University may not subscribe to political publications for other than instructional purposes.
The University may subscribe to newspapers within its service area for public information and instructional-related purposes only.  The only exceptions to the above are that the athletic department may subscribe to newspapers outside the institution's service area, and that subscriptions to newspapers with national distribution may be held for instructional purposes.  Newspaper clipping services may be used, but require approval of the President or the President's designee.
This policy covers all membership dues and subscriptions paid for from State Funds.  Memberships and subscriptions purchased with restricted gift, grant, or contract funds are not subject to these guidelines. They are covered within the terms of the gift, grant, or contract.  All campus libraries are exempt from this policy in their entirety. Purpose   The purpose of this policy is to establish a process for approval of memberships and subscriptions in order to comply with TBR guidelines. Definitions Membership Dues or Subscriptions Any expenditure made by the university which entitle subscription of material or membership, associate membership, or participation in activities of an organization. Organization A group (public or private), association, or society whose purpose is to promote common interests and share information. Publication Directly Related to the Mission A publication without which the mission of the institution would be impossible or difficult to perform. Procedures Approvals New membership dues and subscriptions in excess of $1,000 must be approved by the President or the President's designee in advance.  A written request for approval with an explanation of the specific benefit the institution expects to derive must be submitted by the appropriate vice president/provost to the President.  In subsequent years, provided that the annual cost of the membership or subscription has not increased by more than ten percent, approval of the President or the President's designee shall not be required.
Newspaper clipping services must also be approved by the President or the President's designee.  The need for the service shall be clearly set forth in writing.  The written justification should address the following points:

    the subjects to be clipped.
    the type of clipping service requested. ( For example, all statewide daily newspapers)     
    the use of information provided by the service.  (For example, who the clippings are circulated to in the institution and how the clippings benefit the institution.)
    A statement that the clipping service is the most economical means of fulfilling the institution's need.                                                                   

The President has designated to the department/activity heads the authority to approve all other membership dues and subscriptions within these guidelines. Payment Once approvals have been secured, requests for payment (invoices, Check Request Form, or other disbursement documentation) should be sent directly to the Accounting Office for payment.  If the President or President's designee approval was required, a copy of the approval should be attached to the request for payment.
The appropriate account code to be used for memberships is 74480 and for subscriptions is 74481. FAQs Who do I contact with further questions? The Accounting Office maintains a web page with Frequently Asked Question. Go to:
