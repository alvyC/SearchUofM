                     Welcome to Our graduate program
                     
                     We have master's program with four emphases— Integrated Strategic Media , News and Storytelling , Visual Media and   Mass Media Research . Students choose an emphasis to guide the courses they take.
                     
                     
                     We are a great home for individuals who want to improve their skills in journalism,
                        advertising, public relations, strategic communication and visual media. Our courses
                        are also grounded in the theories and practices of today's mass media. Students are
                        then expected to apply that theory while learning practical skills, such as creating
                        multimedia projects, developing cutting-edge audience research, crafting effective
                        crisis messaging and perfecting a story pitch.
                     
                     
                     Our courses are offered both online and on campus, so students regardless of their
                        time zone can take classes. We also offer a graduate certificate in entrepreneurial journalism , where students work with faculty and the Crews Center for Entrepreneurship to learn
                        more about the realities and abilities of creating a startup business, with the chance
                        to pitch and promote their ideas to funders and other entrepreneurs in Memphis and
                        the Mid-South.
                     
                     
                     Whether you're a prospective student, a current student or someone looking for a great
                        opportunity to build skills and a professional network at the same time, the Department
                        of Journalism and Strategic Media is the place to be. Feel free to contact us with
