                     Not able to locate MMR or Varicella documentation?   Your options are:
                     
                     Have the test for immunity
                     
                     
                        
                        If any component of the MMR Titer test is not positive, BOTH immunizations must be
                           taken again
                        
                        
                        If the Varicella Zoster test is not positive, BOTH immunizations must be taken again
                        
                     
                     
                     Have both immunizations again
                     
                     
                        
                        Because the immunizations must be given 30 days apart, after the student has their
                           first immunization, a temporary 30 day waiver will be given so the student can register
                           for full-time credit hours.

                      Note:    Exemptions may be requested if the student has an allergy to a vaccine component,
                        has a valid medical condition which contraindicates receiving the vaccine, or has
                        religious tenets prohibiting vaccinations. 
                     
                     
                     When immunizations are medically contraindicated, a physician must provide a signed
                        written statement indicating which immunizations are contraindicated and why the immunizations
                        are contraindicated. The letter may be faxed to our office at 901.678.3124 or 901.678.1359.
                     
                     
                     Religious exemptions may be requested. An original signed and notarized statement,
                        affirmed under penalties of perjury that the vaccination conflicts with the religious
                        tenets and practices of the student must be submitted to Student Health Center.  
                     
                     
                     If an exempted student contracts Measles, Mumps, Rubella, or Varicella, or if a Measles,
                        Mumps, Rubella, or Varicella outbreak occurs, it will be the student’s responsibility
                        to remain off campus until a physician gives written permission for the student to
                        return to campus.
