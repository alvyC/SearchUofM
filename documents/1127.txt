                     Overview of OTT procedures These procedures are in alignment with the University's IP Policy
                     
                     Invention disclosures are submitted to the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) via
                        an Invention Disclosure form . They can be scanned and emailed to OTT or sent by hard copy. A letter acknowledging
                        receipt of the disclosure is sent to the inventors. If the invention was made with
                        federal funding, OTT reports the invention to the funding agency via the iEdison website .
                     
                     
                     OTT is responsible for evaluating the market potential for each invention. We share
                        the results with the inventors. This is done by phone, email and meetings. OTT then
                        recommends to the IP Committee whether to exert the university's rights or to waive
                        them. If it is decided to waive them, federally-funded inventions are waived to the
                        funding agency and inventions without such funding are waived to the inventors.
                     
                     
                     If the university exerts its rights, we inform the inventors by a letter signed by
                        the VPR. We also update iEdison.
                     
                     
                     When we exert the university's rights we protect the intellectual property described
                        in the invention disclosure with a patent application or copyright filing as appropriate.
                        We work via TBR to get approval to use outside patent attorneys. Those attorneys draft
                        the patent application and we also ask the inventors to help with technical details
                        of the application.
                     
                     
                     After the application is filed, inventors are required to assign their rights in the
                        invention to the university. This is accomplished by informing them of this obligation
                        and providing an assignment document that has been developed by our external patent
                        counsel. The university then assigns its rights to the University of Memphis Research
                        Foundation. We then determine a marketing strategy and begin to identify potential
                        licensees.
                     
                     
                     If after a patent or copyright application is filed it is found that the invention
                        does not have market potential, we confer with the inventors and the IP Committee.
                        Patent applications deemed by the IP Committee to have little value are either waived
                        to the funding agency or the inventors as relevant.
                     
                     
                     When licenses are being negotiated, OTT leads the effort but seeks the opinion and
                        understands any sensitivities the inventors may have. We also keep the inventors regularly
                        informed about the negotiations.
                     
                     
                     OTT works closely with UMRF to manage the distribution of licensing revenue according
                        to the university's IP policy.
                     
                     
                     If multiple UofM researchers are named as inventors on an invention disclosure, a
                        Creator Income Distribution Agreement (CIDA) is included with the exert letter. UofM
                        inventors must decide themselves how the inventor's share of royalties will be distributed
                        among them should the invention become licensed.
