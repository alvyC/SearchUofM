                     * Applicants whose religious beliefs preclude them from taking the MPRE on a Saturday
                        may apply with LSAC to take the exam on the designated alternate date, usually the
                        following Monday. To apply, you must provide a letter to LSAC on official stationery
                        from your cleric confirming your affiliation with a recognized religious entity that

                        LSAC at MPREInfo@LSAC.org . The letter must be received at LSAC by the late registration deadline or you will
                        not be allowed to test.
