                           Decide at what level of organizational unit you will conduct planning. (Entire college
                              or division? Several departments or key processes?)
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           Assign a key staff person and at least one backup to be responsible for completing
                              the plan for your unit.

                           Prepare your unit’s responses to each of the template’s items. Review with the appropriate
                              administrators, faculty, and staff and make any needed revisions to the online plan.

                           Preparing the continuity plan is just the first phase in the process.  The second phase is making sure your staff understands the plan and how it will be implemented.
                           
                           
                           
                              
                              
                                 
                                 Train all unit staff on the requirements of the plan.
                                 
                              
                              
                              
                                 
                                 Complete Cross training of key staff as needed.
                                 
                              
                              
                              
                                 
                                 Purchase and stockpile necessary supplies and equipment, as appropriate.
                                 
                              
                              
                              
                                 
                                 Contact critical vendors, service suppliers, other university units to ensure critical
                                    operations of the unit will continue in an emergency situation.
                                 
                                 
                              
                              
                              
                                 
                                 Implement all other requirements of the Business Continuity Plan to ensure the unit
                                    is prepared for emergency situations.
                                 
                                 
                              
                              
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           The third phase in the process is to test key functions of the plan to make sure they actually work. 
                              For example, periodically test the communication section to make sure key staff can
                              be contacted by alternate methods.  Use this as a means to update your plan to make
                              sure it is functional.  
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           The final phase in the process is ensuring the plan remains current.  Remember, these plans are living
                              documents – they must be periodically reviewed and updated to be functional.  At a
                              minimum they should be reviewed every year and following activation to make sure the
                              information remains current.
