University of Memphis Alma Mater
Stand firm, O Alma Mater,
Through all the years to come; 
In days of youth and beauty

Thy halls have been our home. 
In time of preparation

Great lessons didst thou teach

Til now, O Alma Mater,

The stars we'll strive to reach.


Lead on, O Alma Mater,

Thy sons to higher ways,

Give light and truth unto them

For all their coming days.

To thee we'll give all honor,

Our hopes abide in Thee,

For thou, O Alma Mater, 
Hast made us ever free.
