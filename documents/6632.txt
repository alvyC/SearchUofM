                     In March of 2014, the Department of Biological Sciences presented the first Bill A.
                        Simco Graduate Research Scholarship, established to honor the many years of service
                        provided to the Department by him. Dr. Simco passed away on January 17, 2016 ( read his obituary ).
                     
                     
                     To apply for the Bill A. Simco Graduate Research Scholarship access the guidelines

                     Dr. Simco began his career at the University of Memphis (then Memphis State University)
                        four decades ago, when the Department only offered Master's degrees and research took
                        a back seat to teaching. In a recent interview with the Daily Helmsman, Dr. Simco
                        indicated that when he arrived at the U of M, his teaching load was about 20 hours
                        a week—it's substantially less than that now. In addition to teaching, Dr. Simco found
                        time to assist in the founding of the U of M's Ecological Research Center , where he continues to serve as co-director and he was instrumental in developing
                        the department's doctoral program.
                     
                     
                     Simco's research interests lie in aquaculture, a result of his work as a graduate
                        student at the University of Kansas. He uses channel catfish as an experimental model
                        because, as he said in the Helmsman article "You can get them in any number and any
                        size. They are quite tolerant of experimental conditions, sort of like an aquatic
                        white rat." Although Dr. Simco enjoys both teaching and research, it's his interactions
                        with students that are most satisfying. Dr. Simco concluded his interview by saying
                        "I'm very honored to have a scholarship in my name," Simco said. "I hope that every
                        graduate student applies and that it will help support students and research for years
                        to come."
                     
                     
                     The scholarship will go to one graduate student per year. Students studying biological
                        sciences will send their proposals to the department's Graduate Studies Committee in order to be considered. The committee will consider students within any field
                        of biology. Graduate students wishing to apply must send in a research proposal listing
                        what they want to research, why it is important and how it impacts the scientific
                        community.
