                     This is a campus PO Box that you rent through Mail Services; it receives top priority
                        when the University mails you important information.
                     
                     
                     You cannot update your Campus Box. However, when you no longer use or rent the box,
                        you should contact Mail Services to request that the box be closed as well as to leave
                        a forwarding address.

                     If you have no Campus Box, this address receives top priority when the University

                        Domestic Students - You may have a Local address if you do not live at your Mailing address.
                        
                        
                        International Students - You must enter and maintain a Local address if your Local residence does not match
                           your Mailing address.
