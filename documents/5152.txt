The Memphis Eagle was founded in 1842 as a weekly Whig paper known as the American Eagle .  Its chief rival was the Democratic-leaning Memphis Appeal .

In late 1842 the paper began putting out a daily paper, the Memphis Eagle , while continuing the weekly American Eagle .  In late 1851 the Eagle merged with the Memphis Enquirer to become the Memphis Eagle-Enquirer .
