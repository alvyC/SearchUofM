                     STUDY ABROAD
                     
                     While Memphis Law does not currently host any study abroad programs, we encourage
                        students to explore programs at other law schools. Study abroad is a great way to
                        gain unique educational experiences and meet students from all over the world.
                     
                     
                     How to Apply for Study Abroad
                     
                     Please review Academic Regulations 16.5 and learn about transfer credit for law school work completed at another law school.
                        Credit will only transfer from an ABA-accredited law school. You first must request
                        the permission of Steven J. Mulroy, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, to enroll in the program. You must make a "C"
                        or better in each course for the credit to transfer. The credit hours transfer, but
                        the actual grade does not.
                     
                     
                     To receive permission from Dean Mulroy, you must submit a written memo requesting
                        approval for transfer credit. The memo must provide sufficient information for Dean
                        Mulroy to evaluate the transfer credit. The memo must be in hard copy (no emails)
                        and must include the following information:
                     
                     
                     1. The name of the law school hosting the study abroad program. (Please note that
                        the law school must be accredited by the ABA).
                     
                     
                     2. An official course description including the number of credit hours to be awarded.
                        (Please note that links to a program are not sufficient - you must copy and paste
                        the relevant information into your memo).
                     
                     
                     3. A description of how the the course(s) is examined (paper, final examination, etc.).
                     
                     4. Information on how the course is graded (pass/fail, letter grades, etc.). Please
                        note that pass/fail credits will not be accepted. If a course is pass/fail, you must
                        contact the host school to make alternative grading arrangements and provide that
                        documentation to Dean Mulroy.
                     
                     
                     5. Your signature.
                     
                     Law schools from all over the country send Memphis Law information about upcoming
                        study abroad opportunities, and we post this information on a bulletin board in the
                        basement near the student mailboxes for you to view. In addition, this list is not exhaustive but contains additional information about international programs.
                     
                     
                     For example, Mississippi College School of Law is hosting programs in Mexico, Cuba,
                        China, Germany, South Korea, and France this year. You can find more information about
                        these programs here .
                     
                     
                     In addition, the ABA maintains as list of ABA-approved study abroad programs for law
                        students. You can access that list here .
                     
                     
                     Also, students can apply for University scholarship funding for study abroad programs
                        here . You can also use financial aid to pay for study abroad programs.  Third party organizations,
                        such as Go Overseas , also have scholarships and funding available.  I recommend searching for other study
                        abroad scholarship opportunities.
                     
                     
                     If you have any questions about study abroad programs, please contact Assistant Dean
                        for Law Student Affairs, Meredith Aden. She can be reached at maden@memphis.edu or by calling (901) 678-2528.
