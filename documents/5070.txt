                     Graduate Assistant Responsibilities
                     
                     
                        
                        Be sure you have a copy of your contract and fully understand its terms.
                        
                        Graduate Assistants can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week.
                        
                        You must maintain a 3.0 cumulative grade point average to continue as a graduate assistant.
                        
                        In order for your tuition and fees to be paid, your contract must reach the Graduate
                           School by the 4th day of classes. It is essential that you provide the department
                           with all relevant information as soon as possible.
                        
                        When the Bursar's Office processes your contract, they pay your tuition and fees.
                           Any services (such as Parking, Financial Aid, or the Recreation Center) that are contingent
                           upon payment of fees have to wait for your contract to reach that office.
                        
                        If you are working less than 20 hours per week, you may pay half of your tuition by
                           the appropriate fee payment deadline. For specific fee payment requirements, fee information,
                           deadlines, and penalties, go to the Bursar's Office web site and select "Fee Payment Information."
                        
                        If you hold an assistantship in the Spring semester, you are eligible to pay in-state
                           tuition rates for the summer semester even if you do not hold a graduate assistantship
                           during the summer. See the Graduate School for additional information.
                        
                        If you have financial aid, you need to notify the Financial Aid Office because the
                           amount of your loan may need to be adjusted.
                        
                        If you are receiving federal work study as part of your stipend, be sure you fully
                           understand the implications. See the Financial Aid office or the Graduate School for
                           details.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     If you are a non-resident alien:
                     
                     
                        
                        You must apply for a social security number as soon as possible.
                        
                        You must give Human Resources a copy of your social security number.
                        
                        After obtaining your social security number, you must see Ms. Senese Duhart, Administration
                           Building 276, to complete a Form W-4 for tax purposes.
