                     *Inclusive GPA refers to the combination of the student's U of M GPA and the GPA from
                        college level transfer courses.
                     
                     
                     In cases where the student's U of M GPA and the inclusive GPA earn them different
                        distinctions, the student will receive the lower of the two distinctions.
                     
                     
                     The actual conferral of Graduation with Distinction cannot be made until the student's
                        U of M and inclusive GPA has been certified by the College/School. Transitional Academic
                        Studies courses (DSP) are not considered in calculating eligibility for Graduation
                        with Distinction. College level courses used to satisfy high school deficiencies will
                        be considered in the computations to determine eligibility for Graduation with Distinction.
                     
                     
                     Transfer Credit in the GPA
                     
                     NOTE: Beginning Summer 2015, a Tennessee Board of Regents' state-wide policy on transfer
                        credit and GPA calculations takes effect. Beginning Summer 2015, transfer credit will
                        be reflected in earned hours, but will no longer apply to the overall GPA (used to
                        determine undergraduate graduation, graduation with distinction, and athletic eligibility)
                        or to the overall combined GPA (used to determine academic standing, financial aid,
                        and scholarship eligibility, except for HOPE):
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        For New Transfer students admitted Summer 2015 and later, no transfer credit will
                           count in GPA.
                        
                        
                        For Readmitted students readmitted Summer 2015 and later, no transfer credit taken
                           since last attending the U of M will count in the GPA. Any transfer work previously
                           processed will continue to be reflected in the GPA.
                        
                        
                        For Continuing students, no transfer credit submitted to and received by the U of
                           M Summer 2015 or later will count in the GPA. Any transfer work previously processed
                           will continue to be reflected in the GPA.
