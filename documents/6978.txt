                        Research Interests
                        
                        Research interests in the Parrill group are in the areas broadly described as computational
                           structural biology and rational ligand design. The rapid growth of experimental techniques
                           that probe the three-dimensional structure of biologically important structures such
                           as proteins have provided a wealth of information that can be used to study protein
                           structure and design ligands that will bind to these molecules. Such ligands can be
                           used to gather additional information that is useful for the optimization of drugs
                           and molecules with other important functions. Specific projects related to both computational
                           structural biology and rational ligand design involve studies of the interactions
                           between existing or newly designed ligands with interesting biological targets.
