                                       together and enjoy each others company. I spent many days just looking forward to
                                       trying new and crazy Chinese foods with some of the most incredible friends I made
                                       abroad.

I was able to view the
                                       world from a different perspective and fully immerse myself in a culture I absolutely
                                       love and respect. The skills I developed as a hospitality student and personal growth
                                       I gained makes me very thankful! I know without a doubt I would not be the person
                                       I am today without this experience.

                                       in America can never replace experiencing it first-hand.

                                       friendly and helpful people. I also loved my familia tica (my host family) and my
                                       roommates. Additionally, I grew to love Costa Rica itself; it is a beautiful country
                                       with so many different types of ecosystems. I loved that I got the chance to travel
                                       to different parts of country and to both Nicaragua and Panama without having to pay
                                       a lot for the actual traveling. Oh and last but certainly not least, I grew to love
                                       gallo pinto, which is a signature tico dish consisting of rice and beans.

I
                                       liked not knowing what it would be like to do normal, every day things that I do here
                                       at home. Being in a place where you can learn from everything - eating food, buying
                                       groceries, meeting people - allowed me to learn through everything I took part in,
                                       and that was the coolest thing for me.
