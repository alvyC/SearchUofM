                     Total Relaxation
                     
                     Don't save a great massage for special "spa" days. Massage therapy is about so much
                        more than pampering. It can be a part of your general health routine. Our massage
                        sessions are open to all UofM employees, students, alumni, and community members,
                        with rates varying according to membership status (see rate chart below).

                     Talk about total relaxation and relief. If you want to release tension, turn to massage therapy. Stress affects everyone
                        — from athletes training for the Olympics to students juggling heavy course loads
                        while working to pay for college. You know you are overly stressed when you experience
                        headaches, cramps, back pain, and physical tension. Stress can also lead to sleepless
                        nights, decreased energy, and lower self-esteem.  Therapeutic massage therapy offers
                        a hands-on approach to good health. When specific massage techniques are applied to
                        various muscle groups, the muscle fibers respond in a number of positive ways:
                     
                     
                     Muscle cell circulation, metabolism, and nutrition for repair and growth will be increased.
                     
                     Muscle fatigue will be eliminated more rapidly.
                     
                     Muscle soreness will be reduced.
                     
                     A state of mental and physical relaxation will be achieved in which repair, recovery,
                        and well-being will be enhanced.

                     History of massage
                     
                     Massage is thought to be the oldest form of medical therapy practiced on the human body.
                        The different types of massage and the various techniques that encompass them stem
                        from our most celebrated civilizations and the traditional beliefs of ancient Greece,
                        Rome, India and China.
                     
                     
                     Dating as far back as 2,700 B.C., ancient Eastern Chinese cultures practiced massage to
                        heal a variety of ailments from labor pain to paralysis. Ancient Egyptian tombs  have
                        been discovered adorned with images of figures being massaged. In addition, according to
                        traditional Indian medicine, a system known as Ayurveda, therapeutic massage was performed
                        using a variety of aromatherapy oils and spices for their healing properties. Even
                        Greek and Roman heroes — such as the great Julius Caesar — underwent daily massages to
                        treat nerve pain.
                     
                     
                     In Western culture the most practiced form of massage is undoubtedly Swedish massage. First
                        introduced in the 19th century, Swedish masseuses were thought to have borrowed many
                        of their techniques from traditional practices originating from China, Egypt, Greece,
                        and Rome. A variety of the most effective massage techniques have also been incorporated
                        into other complementary therapies — aromatherapy, Reiki, reflexology, Rolfing, Amma
                        therapy and osteopathy.
                     
                     
                     Many of our now popular modern massage techniques were created in order to heal specific
                        health conditions. For example, soldiers who fought in World War I were administered
                        massage for nerve damage and to soothe shell shock in western hospitals during the
                        1930s.
                     
                     
                     Massage is still used today for treating a wide range of ages from babies to seniors
                        and in a variety of intensive care, health club, and health clinic and hospital settings.
                        To this day, massage is still used to treat various conditions such as premature birth, various
                        types of cancer, AIDS, osteoarthritis, lumbar back pain, nerve damage, fibromyalgia,
                        paralysis, heart attack, and stroke. Click on the links below to discover an amazing
