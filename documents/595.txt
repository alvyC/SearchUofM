                     High School Students
                     
                     The University of Memphis selectively awards academic scholarships each year. All
                        scholarships are awarded for the academic year (fall and spring semesters only). Scholarships
                        are awarded based on information submitted on the UofM admissions application. For
                        priority consideration, freshmen students should be admitted to the University of
                        Memphis by December 1.
                     
                     
                     University of Memphis scholarship awards are based on a comprehensive review of ACT
                        Composite, SAT (CR+M), or SAT(ERW+M) scores and the cumulative high school grade point
                        average. Most scholarships are four-year, renewable scholarships requiring full-time
                        enrollment. Early application to the University of Memphis is strongly encouraged
                        as scholarship awards are limited.
