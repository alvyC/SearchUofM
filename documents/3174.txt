                        a reorder and the student must cover the cost. These names must match. If you want
                        to change your name on your diploma or in the program, you must do so by completing
                        the Name Change Form with the Registrar's Office. See detailed instruction below to ensure your name is
                        exactly the way you want it to be. 
                     
                     
                     The only acceptable change that does not require a Name Change Form is if your full
                        middle name is in the University system and you only want your middle initial. In
                        this case, the only thing you have to do is let us know. 
                     
                     
                     Process to change my name
                     
                     Changing your name is an easy process. However, you need to ensure you communicate
                        with the Commencement Office, after completing the name change form with the Registrar's
                        Office.
                     
                     
                     1. Look at your name in myMemphis and ensure all of your name is there. 
                     
                     
                     2. If your name is not correct in myMemphis, fax the Name Change Form with the Registrar's Office.
                     
                     
                     -You may also email Averill Conway at  arconway@memphis.edu , and you can take a photograph the form and the document, scan them and email or
                        fax them.
                     
                     
                     -The form needs an actual signature and a supporting document . See the form for acceptable documents. 
                     
                     
                     3. Immediately contact Commencement at commencement@memphis.edu and provide your Full Name, Unumber, Major/College/School and email address.
                     
                     
                     4. Continue to work with Commencement and to ensure your name will be updated in the
                        Commencement program and on your diploma. 
                     
                     
                     The deadline to complete name changes is by the Apply to Graduate deadline for you
                        status (undergraduate, masters/doc or law). We recommend changing your name as early
                        as possible to ensure the program and diploma get changed by final proofing deadlines.
                        Honoring the deadline is very important to the process. Any name change completed
                        after the deadline/diplomas are ordered will be considered a REORDER and the cost
                        will be covered by the student/graduate.
