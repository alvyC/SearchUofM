Welcome to the Graduate School Candidacy form login page. 
  
 
All degree seeking students filing for graduation are required to submit candidacy forms for master's, doctoral and/or graduate certificate programs. Please log in using your U of M email username and password (not your MyMemphis U-number) to create a candidacy form, edit an existing form, or to print a completed form. Signatures are required on this form; therefore, it cannot be electronically submitted. The completed and printed form must be given to your academic department for obtaining the three required signatures. (If you do not have a valid UofM UUID and password, please contact Michelle Stout in the Graduate School for a PDF version of the form). Graduate students are also required to "Apply to Graduate" through their MyMemphis portal. Please click here to obtain instructions for completing this application and for additional information from the Commencement Office. To obtain semester deadlines for submitting both Graduate School forms, please click here . ADDITIONAL NOTES: 1. Students completing an Education Specialist program may use the Education Specialist Program of Studies and Candidacy Form in lieu of the Graduate School form. 2. If you previously filed for graduation and did not meet all degree requirements, it will not be necessary to submit a new candidacy form unless you have made significant changes to your degree program.
