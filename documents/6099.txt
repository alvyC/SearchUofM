                     The Master of Health Administration (MHA) program is one ofÂ 84 programs accredited
                        by the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME), and
                        the only one accredited in Tennessee. The MHA program was ranked in the Top 20 by
                        Modern Healthcare in 2014, and US News & World Report listed it among the best in
                        the nation in 2015 in rankings for Healthcare Management. The 53 credit hour program
                        offers both full and part-time options for the on-campus track, and an executive trackÂ to
                        fit your career and life. The MHA program ensures that students have the necessary
                        competencies to achieve success.
                     
                     
                     Admission to the MHA program is based on selection from a pool of applicants who meet
                        the minimum undergraduate GPA and aptitude examination scores. All applicants are
                        required to submit scores for the Graduate Records Examination (GRE) or the Graduate
                        Management Aptitude Test (GMAT), unless waived by the University of Memphis Graduate
                        School and the MHA faculty.Â  Following interviews of qualified applicants with MHA
                        faculty members, recommendation for admission will be made by the MHA Admissions Committee.
                        A student may be required to complete undergraduate coursework prior to admission;
                        graduate credit is not allowed for courses needed to fulfill these requirements.
