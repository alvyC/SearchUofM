                     The University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law is proud to announce the
                        launch of the Institute for Health Law and Policy ("iHeLP") Policy Lab: ACE Initiative,
                        thanks to generous support from the ACE Awareness Foundation.
                     
                     
                     The result of a transformative investment by the ACE Awareness Foundation, the iHeLP
                        Policy Lab: ACE Initiative will be a multi-disciplinary resource for policy research,
                        policy advising and drafting of new policies to create a nationally-regarded, trauma-informed
                        system, building on the foundation's goals to inform the community about the role
                        of emotional trauma in mental, physical and behavioral health, and implement models
                        that provide preventable and sustainable solutions to reducing toxic stress in family
                        systems.
                     
                     
                     "The ACE Awareness Foundation is committed to creating a trauma informed community
                        that comprehends the impact of toxic stress on child and adult health as well as the
                        silent, long-term social and economic impact on our community," said Ellen Rolfes,
                        Regional Director for the ACE Awareness Foundation. "We are most fortunate to have
                        a partnership with the University of Memphis to develop multi-disciplined ACE curriculum
                        with six academic areas and create a policy initiative with the law school to impact
                        healthcare. Such powerful collaboration is essential to a better Memphis."
                     
                     
                     Dean Peter Letsou announced the ACE Awareness Foundation gift and the iHeLP Policy
                        Lab: ACE Initiative earlier this year at iHeLP's 2016 symposium, An ACE in the Hand
                        of Policy Reform: Loading the Deck for a Trauma-Informed System, attended by stakeholders,
                        nationally recognized leaders, and local and state experts. The gift will enable iHeLP
                        to demonstrate the valuable role it can play as a non-partisan partner with skills
                        and expertise in crafting a policy landscape that sees law itself as an intervention.
                     
                     
                     "Thanks to the generosity and vision of the ACE Awareness Foundation, the law school
                        has been able to spearhead the creation of the University's first multidisciplinary,
                        collaborative ACE curriculum. The work done by the policy lab will build on local
                        and statewide momentum around addressing adversity in the early childhood years and
                        building family support," according to Dean Peter Letsou. "We will partner in efforts
                        to drive system-level health policy change in the Mid-South community across Tennessee
                        for the specific purpose of ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences), mitigation and recovery."
                     
                     
                     This foundation support will not only allow Memphis Law and iHeLP look locally at
                        policy regarding ACEs in Shelby County, but will provide the policy lab with the potential
                        to drive policy change at both the state and national levels. It will also allow Memphis
                        Law to assume a leadership position in the state as the only law school doing this
                        type of work.
                     
                     
                     As part of the policy lab's work, enrolled students and fellows will examine items
                        that include, for example, substantial research into insurance reimbursement policies
                        to help craft "bundled" payment models that incorporate prevention and wellness services
                        promising culturally-sensitive family and parental-support practices and programs.
                        It will also serve as policy advisor and support to the Building Strong Brains: Tennessee
                        ACEs Initiative.
                     
                     
                     "Through this policy lab, I hope to see the Institute help to advance the law school's
                        role in the community and the growing influence of public/private initiatives," said
                        iHeLP Director, Professor Amy Campbell. "This will help create a variety of academic/public/private
                        approaches to benefit our community's overall health and be representative of the
                        Institute's mission to use law and policy to advance health."
