                     “What if I (or my parents) haven’t completed taxes yet or don’t have our 2015 tax
                           returns?”
                     
                     If you or your parents have not completed your taxes yet, you can estimate your income
                        and other tax return information, and then correct your application after you have
                        filed your taxes.
                     
                     
                     When estimating your tax return information, you should indicate that you will file your taxes. If your 2015 income is similar to your 2014 income, use your 2014 tax
                        return to provide estimates for questions about your income. If your income is not
                        similar, use the FAFSA Income Estimator for assistance estimating your adjusted gross
                        income, and answer the remaining questions about your income to the best of your ability.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        You should return to update the estimates you provided with your 2015 tax return information
                           once you file. To update your estimates, click Make FAFSA Corrections after logging in to FAFSA on the Web . Navigate to the “Finances” section and indicate that you have already completed your taxes. If your tax return information is available and if you are eligible to
                           do so, you should use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to transfer your tax return information
                           into your application.
