                     As more organizations undertake business process reengineering (BPR), issues in implementing
                     BPR projects become a major concern. This field research seeks empirically to explore
                     the problems of implementing reengineering projects and how the severity of these
                     problems relates to BPR project success. Based on past theories and research related
                     to the implementation of organizational change as well as field experience of reengineering
                     experts, a comprehensive list of sixty-four BPR implementation problems was identified.
                     The severity of each problem was then rated by those who have participated in reengineering
                     in 105 organizations. Analysis of the results clearly demonstrates the central importance
                     of change management in BPR implementation success. Resolutions of problems in other
                     areas such as technological competence and project planning were also determined to
                     be necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for reengineering success. Further, problems
                     that are more directly related to the conduct of a project such as process delineation,
                     project management, and tactical planning were perceived as less difficult, yet highly
                     related to project success. This situation was also true for human resource problems
                     such as training personnel for the redesigned process. These findings suggest that
                     reengineering project implementation is complex, involving many factors. To succeed,
                     it is essential that change be managed and that balanced attention be paid to all
                     identified factors, including those that are more contextual (e.g., management support
                     and technological competence) as well as factors that pertain directly to the conduct
                     of the project (e.g., project management and process delineation). As one of the first
                     pieces of empirical evidence based on a field study, this research emphasizes the
                     importance of addressing BPR implementation within the broader context of organizational
                     change in a complex sociotechnical environment.
