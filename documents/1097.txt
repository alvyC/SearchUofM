                     UofM Initiates Partnership With Ingersoll Rand/Trane
                     
                     May 20, 2015 - The University of Memphis has established a partnership with Ingersoll
                        Rand, a world leader in creating comfortable, sustainable and efficient environments
                        to increase outreach opportunities between the company and the University's students. In partnership with the UofM, IR/Trane employees will enjoy greater outreach and engagement
                        in UofM initiatives, including undergraduate and graduate degree programs, graduate
                        certificate programs, and participation in internship and career fair events hosted
                        by the UofM and the Herff College of Engineering.
                     
                     
                     Through the partnership, IR/Trane professionals also will continue engaging in career
                        and professional development activities for UofM students. IR/Trane employees have
                        actively coached and mentored students participating in the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute
                        for Social Change's African-American Male Initiative (HAAMI). The focus of this initiative
                        is to increase the retention and graduation of African-American men at the UofM. Similarly,
                        emerging IR/Trane leaders will be introduced to the UofM's professional and continuing
                        education staff to explore on-site and on-campus leadership development and training.
                     
                     
                     "Trane, a leading global provider of indoor comfort and process solutions and services
                        and a brand of Ingersoll Rand, believes in the power of innovation. It's part of our
                        company's DNA," said Jim Crone, comprehensive solutions business development manager
                        for the Mid-South markets. "Solutions from Trane help organizations achieve their
                        mission. We are convinced that an innovative partnership with the University of Memphis
                        will both enhance student success in the classroom as well as meet our employees'
                        unique needs for continuing education and professional development."
                     
                     
                     Ingersoll Rand is proud of its industry-leading early talent programs, with one program
                        dating back to 1926. Shannon Mullins, a talent acquisition manager, said, "Our early
                        talent programs are built on a foundation of commitment to partnerships throughout
                        the academic communities, and the relationship with the University of Memphis is a
                        key to sustaining our growth in the Mid-South."
                     
                     
                     "A key role of the FedEx Institute of Technology is to facilitate collaboration across
                        campus to foster innovation in how we engage with our external stakeholders," added
                        Dr. Jasbir Dhaliwal, chief innovation officer. "I want to congratulate both the Hooks
                        Institute for Social Change and the Herff College of Engineering for coming together
                        to work with Ingersoll Rand/Trane and our students. This is a natural partnership
                        centered on a deep understanding that workforce development is a central pillar of
                        social change in our community.
                     
                     
                     "We welcome Ingersoll Rand/Trane as a special partner of the University and look forward
                        to a close relationship focusing on excellence across engineering, business and social
                        initiatives."
