                     About President M. David Rudd
                     
                     M. David Rudd is President of the University of Memphis, a position he has held since
                           May of 2014. As a Distinguished University Professor of Psychology, he also continues
                           funded research, along with his affiliation with the National Center for Veterans
                           Studies at the University of Utah, as co-founder and scientific director. Before transitioning
                           to his current position, he served as Provost for over a year in Memphis. Prior to
                           moving to Memphis, he was dean of the College of Social & Behavioral Science at the
                           University of Utah.
                     
                     Student success has been an early focus of his tenure in Memphis, with significant
                           improvements in retention and graduation numbers. He spearheaded an effort to create
                           a student success center, developed the university's first integrated enrollment,
                           retention, and graduation plan, created a one-stop admissions center, developed targeted
                           degree pathways for all majors, implemented an Academic Coaching for Excellence initiative,
                           along with efforts to improve the effectiveness of student academic advising.
                     
                     He has made a strong commitment to containing higher education costs and lowering
                           student debt, holding tuition flat during his first year, the first such move in over
                           three decades at the University of Memphis, followed by two years of increases below
                           three percent and well below historic university averages. Given dramatic changes
                           in higher education funding, Dr. Rudd also initiated efforts to improve efficiency
                           across all university divisions, including the development and implementation of a
                           new budget model that allows for greater local control, direction and reinforces entrepreneurial
                           creativity. Institutional effectiveness, across all divisions of the university have
                           been a central focus as well, with creation of the university's first institutional
                           effectiveness council.
                     
                     Efforts to grow community partnerships and engagement have been very successful during
                           his first two years, with creative partnerships with the Memphis Symphony, St. Jude
                           Children's Research Hospital, Shelby County Schools, and Methodist Healthcare. His
                           first year saw a record $37M raised, with second year numbers surpassing that total
                           and exceeding $38M raised. Including the current year, a total of over $500M is being
                           invested on campus and in the university neighborhood district, with over $140M of
                           private funds. Dr. Rudd launched a national visibility campaign in his first year
                           in partnership with FedEx Corporation, an effort that is already garnering attention.
                           More U of M academic programs are currently ranked (across multiple ranking systems)
                           than at any time during the university's 104-year history.
                     
                     Dr. Rudd has been a strong advocate for growing the university's research mission.
                           During his first year, the U of M was successful in landing a National Institute of
                           Health Center of Excellence in mobile health technology (covered in the President's
                           Report), with ten nationally ranked university partners. The Center's first year has
                           been a great success, with a subsequent $60M grant submission and an impressive array
                           of scientific publications.
