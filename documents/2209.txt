                           About Dr. Bowers
                           
                           Dr. Bowers' research focuses on the evolutionary, physiological, and behavioral ecology
                              of wild birds. The study of birds presents an excellent opportunity to investigate
                              questions related to vertebrate ecology, physiology, social behavior, and evolution.
                              Dr. Bowers and his colleagues use a variety of techniques to investigate questions
                              related to animal ecology and evolution, including responses to anthropogenic activity
                              and climate change. Dr. Bowers and his research group will soon be establishing study
                              populations of birds at the Meeman Biological Station north of Memphis to investigate
                              these issues.
