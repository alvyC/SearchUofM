                        The Southeastern Section of the American Physical Society gave its George W. Peagram
                           Award for Contributions to the Teaching of Physics to Dr Marchini in 2007. The citation
                           read as follows:
                        
                        
                        "The field of physics has historically depended upon individuals who can reach beyond
                           their colleagues to invite students and the public to appreciate the beauty and importance
                           of nature's laws of physics. Professor Marchini is the finest possible example of
                           such an individual. He has reached thousands of students and teachers in the State
                           of Tennessee at all levels of the education system and outside the education system.
                           Generations of students at his home institution owe their excellent learning opportunities
                           to him. Professor Marchini is an evangelist for our field. Upon him the Southeastern
                           Section of the American Physical Society confers its highest honor for excellence
                           in the teaching of physics, the George B. Peagram Award.
