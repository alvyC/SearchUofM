                     Data management (DM) has existed in conjunction with software development and the
                        management of the full set of information technology (IT)-related components. However,
                        it has been more than two decades since research into DM as it is practiced has been
                        published. In this paper, the authors compare aspects of DM across a quarter-century
                        timeline, obtaining data using comparable sets of subject matter experts. Using this
                        information to observe the profession's evolution, the authors have updated the understanding
                        of DM as it is practiced, giving additional insight into DM, including its current
                        responsibilities, reporting structures, and perceptions of success, among other factors.
                        The analysis indicates that successfully investing in DM presents current, real challenges
                        to IT and organizations. Although DM is evolving away from purely operational responsibilities
                        toward higher-level responsibilities, perceptions of success have fallen. This paper
                        details the quarter-century comparison of DM practices, analyzes them, and draws conclusions.
