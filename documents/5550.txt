The Bursar's Office is responsible for the determination and collection of all amounts due the University. 
The University has specific procedures through which the assessment or refund of any fee, fine, or charge can be appealed.
University policy UM1734 Cash Handling and related procedures concerning the handling of cash receipts should be reviewed and followed if the department or activity will be involved in the handling of collections. Cash receipting by other departments must be approved by the Bursar and employees with a responsibility for collecting cash must be trained prior to the collection of University fees and charges. Establishing University Fees/Charges All requests for the establishment of new University fees/charges or for changes in existing University fees/charges should be submitted in writing to the Bursar on the "New Fee or Change in Amount of Fee Request" form. All requests should be completed in full and should include the proposed effective date of the establishment/modification as well as the refund policy for the fee/charge. If there will be no refund of the fee or charge, it should be clearly indicated as a "Non-refundable" fee/charge.
The Bursar will prepare and submit each fee/charge request to the appropriate officials for formal approval. The Bursar will formally notify the requesting official of the fee/charge's approval or the denial of the establishment/modification of the fee/charge.
The Tennessee Board of Regents has adopted the practice of approving the establishment and/or modification of tuition and out-of-state tuition once per year at their June meeting when the annual budget is considered. All other fees/charges affecting students are considered for approval at the March meeting.  The Bursar's Office will notify all departments of the internal deadline each year.  This deadline is necessary to allow time for university review/approvals prior to submission to TBR by their January deadline.  Proposals which require TBR approval should, therefore, be submitted to the Bursar according to the schedule indicated in the fee request email sent by the Bursar in early fall.
Requests for seminars, workshops, conferences and other one-time-events may be submitted during the year, but must be received in the Bursar's Office at least two months prior to the event.
The Bursar's Office will maintain all correspondence and original approvals of all University fees and charges. 
The Assistant Vice President for Finance may also approve, in specific instances, other University officials/offices to assume responsibility for the determination and collection of fees/charges and the determination of refunds. Each instance, however, must be approved in writing by the Assistant Vice President for Finance. Fees and Charges All fees and charges must go through the fee approval process before they become effective.  These fees and charges will include, but are not limited to, the following:

  Publishing University Fees/Charges The University attempts to follow a general standard format when publishing information on University fees and charges. 
The format includes, but is not limited to, the following:

    All statements which include a University fee/charge amount should be complete and specific enough to prevent any misunderstanding by the readers.
    Whenever a University fee/charge is quoted or specified, the refund status should also be stated. If there are qualifying conditions for a fee refund, these conditions should also be stated.
    Where applicable, specific dates related to the payment of University fees and associated fee refunds should be stated or a link to that information should be provided. 
    It should be specified that any payment of University fees should be made payable online, where possible, or checks made to The University of Memphis and an exact mailing address approved by the Bursar's Office should be provided if payments by mail can reasonably be expected.
Appeals of University Fees/Charges and Refunds Any student or other interested individual may appeal the assessment, application, calculation, or interpretation of any University fee, charge, deposit, refund, or any University action connected with fees, charges, refunds, and collection procedures.  Appeals for any fee, charge, refund, or calculation relating to registration fees must be submitted by the student within one year of the term in which the fee assessment was made.
A written appeal may be filed on forms available online or in the Bursar's Office and may be approved if within the guidelines of the Bursar's Office.  If the Bursar's Office does not approve the appeal, the appellant is advised of his/her rights to file a second appeal within ten (10) days to the Assistant Vice President (AVP) for Finance.  The decision of the AVP of Finance may be appealed to the University's Fee/Refund Appeals Committee; this is the last appeals step which will be acted upon by the University. The recommendation of the University's Fee/Refund Appeals Committee will be forwarded to the Vice President for Business and Finance for a final decision. Detailed information is available on the Bursar's website under "Student Financial Appeals" at http://bf.memphis.edu/finance/bursar/appeals.php  .
Traffic fines and citations may be appealed through a separate process on forms available from the Parking Office, Office of Student Conduct, or the Student Government Association Office. Residence Life appeals are also subject to a separate appeal procedure.
Appeals related to Residence Life and Dining Services financial matters should be filed first with the Office of Residence Life and Dining Services for processing. Decisions of the Office of Residence Life and Dining Services may be appealed in writing to the Office of the Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs and the Dean of Students. This decision may be appealed to the University Fee/Refund Appeals Committee. Collection of University Fees and Charges The Bursar's Office follows detailed collection procedures for university fees and charges, in accordance with TBR Guideline B-010.
Pursuant to T.C.A. Section 28-1-113, there is no time limit on the institutions' authority to collect receivables unless otherwise expressly provided by statute.
