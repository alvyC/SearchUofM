                     For over a century, research has documented the dominant configuration of lecture,
                        recitation, and seatwork in American schools. Recent research looking at the role
                        of classroom discourse, i.e., interactions between teachers and students, has confirmed,
                        as an alternative to this configuration, the importance of open discussions prompted
                        by open-ended teacher questions ("authentic teacher questions") in reading and literature
                        instruction. The goal of our project, using cutting-edge research in speech recognition,
                        discourse classification, and natural language understanding (NLU), is to develop
                        CLASS 5.0, a computer program that will autonomously code classroom interactions between
                        teachers and their students. CLASS 5.0 will radically simplify and accommodate automated
                        coding and assessment of classroom discourse, which, in turn, could revolutionize
                        classroom research.
