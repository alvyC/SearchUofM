                     Students who miss the deadline for the intended semester of graduation will have to
                        wait for the next semester to graduate. Note that the deadline for December graduation
                        is in July when most faculty are not available. If you plan on graduating in the Fall
                        semester, file for graduation during you last Spring semester before the faculty leave
                        for summer to ensure meeting the deadline.
                     
                     
                     Graduating from the Herff College of Engineering
                     
                     In order to be awarded a Bachelor of Science degree from the Herff College of Engineering,
                        a number of requirements must be met. In general, the requirements to be met are:
                     
                     
                     General Education (GenEd) requirements must be satisfied. Some programs may stipulate which courses
                        are to be used to satisfy particular GenEd categories. See your advisor for specifics.
                     
                     
                     Program Requirements for your particular major must be satisfied.
                     
                     
                     Grade Point requirements must be satisfied. In order to graduate from the University, you must
                        have a minimum 2.00 grade point average (overall and UofM GPAs).
                     
                     
                     Residency Requirements, both University and College, must be met. A student will satisfy residence requirements
                        for graduation by earning at least twenty-five (25) percent of credit hours required
                        for the degree at the University of Memphis. At least thirty (30) of the final sixty
                        (60) hours required for the degree must be completed at the University of Memphis
                        as upper division credit in the Herff College of Engineering. A student transferring
                        credits from a two-year college or institution must complete, as a requirement for
                        the baccalaureate degree, a minimum of sixty semester hours in an accredited senior
                        institution.
                     
                     
                     Testing may be required at either the University, College, or program level. Check with your
                        advisor and/or graduation analyst to determine if there are any testing requirements
                        that you need to meet in order to graduate.
                     
                     
                     File Your Intent to Graduate! Graduation is not automatic and you must file your intent to graduate by the deadlines.
                        Check the dates and deadlines calendar for the filing deadline for your intended semester of graduation. You must complete
                        the Intent to Graduate Form through the Commencement Office by the published deadline. You also need to see your
                        advisor to file your College of Engineering Degree Application.
                     
                     Check the Commencement Office web site to fill out commencement attendance cards, diploma mailing cards, check
                        commencement program proofs, get cap and gown information, etc.
                     
                     
                     Pay Any Outstanding Fees !!! If you have any outstanding financial obligations to the University, you will
                        not receive your diploma and you will not be able to request transcripts.
