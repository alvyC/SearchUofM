                     LEAD Conference
                     
                     The UofM LEAD Conference on Student Leadership provides training and networking opportunities
                        for college student leaders annually. Through a combination of keynote speakers, self-selected
                        breakout sessions, and shared conversations, students hear from campus and community
                        leaders about a range of topics meant to support organizational growth and personal
                        development. Time is built into the day for peer networking among student leaders
                        to promote collaborative efforts and programming.
                     
                     
                     The next Conference will be held on Saturday, October 15, 2016 from 8:30 am until
                        2:30 pm on the third floor of the University Center.
