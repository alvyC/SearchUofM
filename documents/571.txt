                     Tigers:
                     
                     Welcome to the SGA website. I hope that you will find all the resources you need and
                        all the up-to-date information on how your SGA is working for you. A few newer features
                        on our website include the student discounts tab, which lists local and national discounts
                        you receive for being a University of Memphis student. Another new feature is the
                        Transparency tab, where you can find all the latest information about what SGA is
                        working on, as well as Senate meeting minutes, bills, and Executive Proposals. If
                        you see something wrong on our campus that needs our attention, visit the We the Students
                        tab and fill out a petition. Then get your friends and peers to sign and comment on
                        it. This is a very important new student resource because it tells your SGA and administration
                        what is important to you. If a petition isn't what you're looking for, leave an anonymous
                        suggestion in the suggestion box and an SGA Executive Officer will quickly review
                        it. Please feel free to contact us with anything that would make you a more successful
                        student and make your college experience better. We are here for you, and to ensure
                        you succeed.
