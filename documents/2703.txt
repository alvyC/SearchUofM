                     Subject Pool
                     
                     The Subject Pool in the Psychology Department at the University of Memphis is a resource
                        for faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students alike. Faculty,
                        staff, and graduate students have the opportunity to further the field of psychology
                        by conducting research with participants who are more accessible than the general
                        public. In turn, undergraduate students have the opportunity to learn more about the
                        research process first hand by participating in experiments.
                     
                     
                     The Subject Pool is dedicated to the promotion of ethical research and works closely
                        with the Institutional Review Board of the University of Memphis to achieve this goal.
                        Important guidelines and policies have been put in place to help ensure that research
                        is conducted ethically (and in accordance with the Ethical Code of the American Psychological
                        Association). All faculty, staff, and graduate students who conduct research in the
                        Psychology Department are obligated to follow these guidelines. At the same time,
                        it is important for students to understand their rights and obligations as participants
                        in research that is conducted in the department. The information contained in this
                        area of the website aims to assist faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate
                        students to be informed users of this resource.
