                     The University of Memphis' Study Abroad offers more than 200 semester, academic year
                        and summer programs in over 60 countries to meet the diverse needs of the UofM student
                        population. Bilateral Exchanges UofM bilateral exchange programs are programs that offer students the opportunity
                        to study at one of our partner schools abroad for a semester, academic year or summer.
                        Students participating in an exchange program pay UofM tuition and the application
                        fee. Students are responsible for paying their housing fees directly to the host institution. Faculty–Led Programs UofM faculty and academic departments organize UM study abroad programs for students.
                        Students participating on a faculty-led program earn UofM credit. Our faculty-led
                        programs are offered during winter and summer sessions as well as fall and spring
                        break. Some faculty-led programs are designed as residency programs while others are
                        travel seminars that provide an in-depth introduction to the country. Since these
                        programs are led by UofM faculty, they provide a wonderful opportunity for students
                        to interact with faculty and share an international experience.

                        English at various sites across the world. UofM Sponsored Programs To enable us provide more options for study abroad locations the UofM has affiliations
