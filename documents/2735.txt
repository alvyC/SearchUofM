                     About the Graduate Program
                     
                     The Department of Sociology at the University of Memphis offers graduate studies leading
                        to the Master of Arts in Sociology. Training in theory, research methods, and statistics
                        is required of all students. In addition, the program offers a wide selection of courses
                        in many substantive areas such as race, class and gender studies; globalization and
                        development; social change; family; deviance; religion, and medical sociology.
                     
                     
                     The Master's program provides opportunities to develop skills and interests in specific
                        specialty areas while obtaining a solid grounding in sociological theory and social
                        research methods. The program offers a high level of student-faculty interaction and
                        the opportunity to participate in supervised research. The exposure to a full range
                        of sociological specialties allows our M.A. graduates to apply to and be accepted
                        by a wide range of Ph.D. programs. It is also appropriate for students who want to
                        work in areas of applied research.
                     
                     
                     There are two degree options available to students pursuing the M.A. in sociology
                        - a thesis program (24 hours of graduate course work plus 6 hours of credit for writing
                        a thesis) or a non-thesis program (33 hours of graduate course work with both written
                        and oral comprehensive examinations that cover sociological theory, research methods
                        and statistics, and a substantive area selected by the student).
