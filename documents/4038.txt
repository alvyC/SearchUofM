                        International applicants should consult "Admission of International Students" below
                        for further requirements.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        A Baccalaureate or Master's Degree as specified by the program: The applicant must provide an official transcript showing an earned bachelor's or
                           master's degree, depending on program requirements. If you are a UofM undergraduate
                           student applying to Graduate School at UofM, you do not need to request that an official
                           transcript be sent to Graduate Admissions. This office has access to your transcript. The
                           degree must have been awarded by an accredited college or university. Only transcripts
                           received directly from an issuing institution are considered official. For domestic
                           students, signed and sealed transcripts that have been in the applicant's possession
                           can be used for admission purposes; however, official transcripts may later be requested.
                           Personal copies are not acceptable as official documents.
                        
                        Entrance Examinations:  New applicants may be required by the individual program to have taken an appropriate
                           entrance examination within five years of the application date. Contact your program
                           for information on which tests and what score(s) are acceptable. Test scores must
                           be sent directly to Graduate Admissions by the testing agency. The University of Memphis
                           institution code number for reporting ETS scores is R-1459. Some programs may waive
                           the entrance examination requirement for applicants with exceptional credentials,
                           extensive professional experience, or a prior doctoral degree from an accredited institution.
                           See individual program descriptions for details.
                        
                        Program Requirements: Some academic units may have separate departmental applications and/or additional
                           requirements, such as portfolios, proficiency examinations, auditions, etc. Refer
                           to the appropriate program description in this Bulletin for details.
