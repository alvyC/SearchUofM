                     Strategic Commitment from FedEx Corp. Advances UofM Technology and Research
                     
                     March 27, 2015 - FedEx Corporate Services Inc. recently made a $3 million commitment
                        over three years to the University of Memphis' FedEx Institute of Technology. The
                        gift underscores President M. David Rudd's vision for the Institute to advance interdisciplinary
                        research and faculty collaborations in partnership with global technology organizations.
                        Based in Memphis, FedEx Corp. is a leading worldwide provider of transportation, e-commerce
                        and business services.
                     
                     
                     The renewed support from FedEx allows the U of M to strategically invest in existing
                        areas of strength to build nationally recognized centers of applied research through
                        the FedEx Institute of Technology. Initial areas of continued investment include data
                        analytics, information security and testing, intermodal freight transportation, mobile
                        sensors and quality data management. Also through this investment, the U of M will
                        enter into a partnership framework with Memphis Bioworks Foundation, the Entrepreneurship-Powered
                        Innovation Center (EPIcenter) program, the Greater Memphis Chamber's Chairman's Circle,
                        and other corporate partners to advance logistics innovation.
                     
                     
                     "We are grateful to continue our close relationship with FedEx Corp., a company with
                        a worldwide reputation for excellence," said Rudd. "This renewed partnership for innovative
                        research, technology development and education with FedEx is the catalyst for the
                        FedEx Institute of Technology's success and expansion."
                     
                     
                     Since 2005, FedEx has invested more than $8.875 million in the FedEx Institute of
                        Technology.
                     
                     
                     "FedEx is pleased to continue our collaboration and partnership with the University
                        of Memphis," said Rob Carter, executive vice president and CIO of FedEx Corporation.
                        "As we move forward in our second decade of support of the FedEx Institute of Technology,
                        there is great clarity of intent, which I am confident will result in even greater
                        success, innovation and recognition for all involved."
                     
                     
                     Dr. Jasbir Dhaliwal, the newly appointed executive director of the FedEx Institute
                        of Technology and the U of M's chief innovation officer, said, "The University of
                        Memphis and FedEx are a natural fit for leading technology innovation in our region.
                        This gift allows us to continue our ongoing innovation journey in niche areas that
                        matter to our region and in which we have international leadership. We want everyone
