                        Dr. Parris has broad interests in amphibian population and disease ecology. He joined
                           the University of Memphis after obtaining his PhD at the University of Missouri and
                           a postdoc at Arizona State University. He teaches courses in Evolution, Anatomy and
                           Physiology, Herpetology, and Population Ecology.
