                     The UofM now offers employers the opportunity to post their internship postings on
                        our campus-wide electronic network.   This network can be accessed by current students or alumni.
                     
                     
                     This system can be used for full-time jobs, part-time jobs, or internships.   When posting an internship, consider the tasks you have for your internship.    Do these tasks or projects involve learning opportunities for students?   Will it assist them in learning more about your industry or organization?
                     
                     
                     Particularly for academic internships, we encourage you to distinguish between an
                        internship and a part-time job.   In general, an internship provides a learning opportunity for the student to acquire
                        new skills or knowledge during the internship period.  
                     
                     A part-time job generally involves tasks that a typical part-time employee has performed
                        in the past such as answering the phone, filing, or handling customer requests.
                     
                     
                     A   few examples of an academic internship   are Marketing Research projects, Process Improvement Projects, Social Media Development
                        and Analysis, or Financial or Pricing Analysis projects.   The list varies with employers and their organizations but the goal is project work
                        that “teaches” the students something new through the experience.
                     
                     
                     Our students need both internships and part-time jobs so we are happy to list both
                        types of opportunities for you—we just ask you to categorize your needs between these
                        two options.
                     
                     
                     When using this system, it is important to clearly communicate your opportunity in
                        order to attract students to your posting.   Points of importance include:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Internship responsibilities or duties
                        
                        Work Location
                        
                        Compensation
                        
                        Campus Interviews—this is optional, it is also helpful for the internship candidates
                           to visit your location for the interview as well.
                        
                        
                        Hours Expected (Academic Internships require a minimum of 150 clock hours in order
                           to earn academic credit)
                        
                        
                        Directions for submitting resumes from interested students—who in your organization
                           should receive these resumes; most employers prefer resumes to be emailed to a key
                           contact for processing.
