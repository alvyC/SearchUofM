                        which emphasizes the practical application of health promotion methods supported by
                        theoretical foundations, relevant research and best practices.. Students in health
                        promotion must complete an applied project grounded in the practical application of
                        health promotion methods and a comprehensive examination. Resident students may apply
                        for a graduate assistantship.
                     
                     
                     The program examines the various factors responsible for the adoption and maintenance
                        of health-related behaviors and identifies best practices that can be implemented
                        for lifestyle change across a variety of settings. Graduates will be able to design,
                        implement, manage, and evaluate health promotion programs in a variety of settings,
                        including federal, state, and local governmental agencies, HMOs, hospitals, public
                        and private schools, colleges and universities, voluntary health agencies (e.g., American
                        Heart Association), and private enterprises such as business and industry. Our graduates
                        have accepted positions as program directors at private and government agencies, senior
                        research assistants in hospitals and education arenas, and corporate and community
                        fitness and wellness leaders.
