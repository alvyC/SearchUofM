                           effects from their gambling. Nearly 8 million adolescents experience negative effects
                           from gambling. 
                     
                     Q: You have to be irresponsible to have a gambling problem, right?
                     
                     A: Wrong. Anyone can develop problems if they are not aware of risks or do not gamble
                           responsibly. When gambling interferes with finances, work responsibilities, or relationships,
                           a serious problem exists.
                     
                     Q: Can you be a a problem gambler if you don't gamble every day?
                     
                     A: Yes. The frequency does not determine if a person has a problem. What is more important
                           are the consequences a person is experiencing from their gambling.
                     
                     Q: Do people with gambling problems have other issues?
                     
                     A: About half of people who are problem gamblers have previously met criteria for another
                           psychiatric disorder, most commonly a mood disorder or alcohol use disorder.
