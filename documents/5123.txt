                     Emerging Leader Parent and Family
                     
                     Over the years, students have described their interactions with other Emerging Leaders
                        as a family experience. It makes sense that they would view their time with each other
                        and the unique bond they share as an "EL Family." With that spirit in mind, coupled
                        with an understanding that you, as parents and family members, may have a different
                        set of concerns from your student, this page is set up to provide information that
                        may be helpful to you.

                     The selection process for this program is more involved and complex than many scholarships.
                        As a result, you may have a great deal of questions. Please take a look at the FAQ section to the left of your screen to see if we have been able to answer some of the things
                        you want to know. If not, you are welcome to contact Michael Marino, Senior Coordinator
                        for LEAD Programs, at  mdmarino@memphis.edu or 901.678.2357 for further assistance.
                     
                     
                     Academic Success
                     
                     Students and family members are both concerned about academic performance. Oftentimes,
                        those anxieties are amplified with the Emerging Leaders Program because of the out-of-class
                        obligations of the program; however, it is possible to correlate success in the classroom
                        to the supportive guidance given to Emerging Leaders outside the classroom.
                     
                     
                     Taking a look at the results of the 2013-2014 academic year, freshman Emerging Leaders
                        had a combined fall semester grade point average (GPA) of 3.65 on a 4.0 scale, and
                        100% of freshmen were retained for their sophomore year, which is over 20% better
                        than the rate for all first-time freshman at the University and slightly higher than
                        historical averages for scholarships that require a stronger incoming academic profile
                        than Emerging Leaders.
                     
                     
                     Across the entire program, all classes averaged at or above a 3.25. Additionally,
                        nearly 13% of all program participants had a spring semester GPA of 4.0. Finally,
                        when you compare groups that started in the fall of 2009, the 4 year graduation and
                        retention rates of Emerging Leaders recipients versus recipients of the Tennessee
                        Hope Lottery Scholarship, which has similar academic requirements to receive and maintain,
                        Emerging Leaders is nearly 25% better. Emerging Leaders succeed as students in their
                        freshman year, and it continues throughout graduation.
                     
                     
                     Professional Preparation
                     
                     Workforce demands change constantly. In order to prepare Emerging Leaders to operate
                        in this flexible environment, each year in the program has some degree of professional
                        development. The requirements for each student match the intended learning for a program
                        year and are structured to allow for students to change course as their professional
                        aspirations are clarified.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Freshmen are asked to research and present on a career path, taking into account a course
                           of study and involvement that will support that path.
                        
                        
                        Sophomores complete small projects for local companies in their Emerging Leaders class; they
                           are also encouraged to seek out a mentoring program.
                        
                        
                        Juniors , if they have not done so already, are expected to complete an internship and continue
                           in some form of mentoring program.
                        
                        
                        Seniors do a final walk through of personal branding, interview preparation, and résumé polishing
                           with a member of the program staff.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Ongoing Support
                     
                     Emerging Leaders have to attend New Student Orientation and Frosh Camp because those
                        programs have been shown to help ease the transition of students from high school
                        to college. The Emerging Leaders retreat occurs to ensure that every student enters
                        the experiences with a clear understanding of expectations. Freshmen are paired with
                        an upperclassman mentor so they have an older peer to look to for help in the first
                        year. Finally, students meet individually with program staff throughout their time
                        in the program to receive guidance and direction that meets their unique needs and
                        goals.
