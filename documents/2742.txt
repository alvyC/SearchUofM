                     The University College graduate programs are designed to fulfill personal and professional
                        development interests not found through other programs on campus. Students have the
                        option to customize a degree plan bridging two or more disciplines and may also earn
                        credit hours through work experience or professional training. All of our courses
                        are offered in formats tailored to fit the busy schedules of adult, non-traditional
                        students.
