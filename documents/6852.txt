                     Enterprise-level information systems (IS) are fundamental to businesses. Unfortunately,
                     implementing these large-scale systems is a complex and risky endeavor. As a result,
                     these initiatives must tap the expertise and active involvement of both the IS department
                     and the enterprise's functional areas. Past studies focusing on IS implementation
                     teams consistently identify the IS department as the source of technical expertise
                     and leadership, while functional department team members are typically relegated to
                     the role of business experts. However, unlike the past, many business professionals
                     are knowledgeable about information technology (IT) and are increasingly capable of
                     contributing to IS implementations from a technical perspective as well as a business
                     perspective. This study examines how IT competence held by both the IS department
                     and the user department stakeholders contributes to user satisfaction with the enterprise-level
                     system implementation. Specifically, this research introduces a theoretically grounded
                     construct, joint IT competence, which emerges when the IS department and user department
                     stakeholders integrate their individually held IT competences. The study's results
                     empirically demonstrate that joint IT competence is a key driver of user satisfaction
                     in enterprise-level IS implementations. Although not as significant as joint IT competence,
                     results show that partner-based leadership between the IS department and user stakeholders
                     also influences user satisfaction with IS implementations.
