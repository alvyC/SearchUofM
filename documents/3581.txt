                        Professor Frank's scholarship and speaking interests are in the areas of civil and
                           criminal courtroom evidence, systemic discrimination and federal court litigation

                           Bias, Uncharged Act Evidence & the Colorblind Courtroom, was published in the Harvard
                           Journal on Racial & Ethnic Justice and addresses the role of implicit bias in admitting
                           uncharged act evidence against racially diverse criminal defendants. Professor Frank
                           has presented on a number of issues related to race in courtroom, systemic disparity,
                           implicit bias and mass incarceration.
