                     Orchestrating programs of organizational transformation that result in sustained process
                     improvement represents a difficult managerial challenge. Yet, ever-changing customer
                     requirements, electronic partnerships, and increasingly complex intraorganizational
                     arrangements are forcing many well-established firms to transform themselves from
                     function-based forms of organization into process-based systems of managerial, task,
                     and evaluative arrangements. Through a program of managed transformation, the Information
                     Services (IS) function at Bose Corporation has realized dramatic improvements in the
                     delivery of information products/services and is now "charting the course" for a sustained
                     process management view that will define and measure business relationships well into
                     the next century. In contrast to many well-publicized programs of change, the drive
                     toward sustained process improvement and innovation by Bose IS resembles an evolutionary
                     model of organizational learning and information sharing rather than a revolutionary
                     model of immediate and drastic transformation. This study describes the defining stages,
                     key events, and obstacles of the road traveled by Bose IS in transforming itself from
                     a corporate utility into an enterprise-wide source of process innovation and improvement.
