                     Relinquishment/Transfer
                     
                     Department or PI informs the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSPA) staff and the Sponsor's
                        Program Official as early as possible that a PI is transferring and provides information
                        regarding the date of transfer, what awards the PI expects to transfer, and the name
                        of the new institution. The transfer/relinquishment date should be the last date the
                        PI is to be employed with UofM to coincide with the day significant programmatic interest
                        is no longer performed at this institution. If some work is expected to continue after
                        the PI has left UofM, the PI should work with the new institution and OSP staff to
                        establish a subaward as a mechanism for reimbursement for any expenses incurred at
                        UofM after the relinquishment date.
                     
                     
                     The OSP staff will facilitate the transfer process, based on receipt of the above
                        information, by coordinating with the PI and other UofM units to assemble and submit
                        the necessary documents required for the transfer.
                     
                     
                     Equipment Transfer: If the PI is expecting to transfer equipment to their new institution, the Department
                        or PI will follow the instructions outlined in the Fixed Asset Guidelines. The OSP
                        staff is responsible for reviewing the applicable sponsor's equipment disposition
                        guidelines to ensure UofM has the authority to transfer equipment indicated. The OSP
                        staff will initial next to the OSP Director's signature on the equipment relinquishment
                        letter, forward for the Director's signature, and return to Fixed Assets for processing.
                     
                     
                     Grant Transfer: The OSP staff will perform an analysis of the PI's portfolio, determine the transfer
                        procedure, if a set transfer procedure for the sponsor exists, work with the Department
                        to estimate the account expenditures at the time of the transfer, and ask the Department
                        which accounts the Chair will agree to be transferred. The department will work with
                        OSP, if there are any subawards that need to be terminated.
                     
                     
                     The PI will submit all non-financial documents requested as soon as possible. This
                        may include, but is not limited to a progress report, final invention statement, certified
                        effort report, as well as any award application documents required to be submitted
                        from the new institution.
                     
                     
                     The OSP staff will prepare the relinquishing documents in accordance with sponsor
                        requirements or use the Non-Federal Relinquishment Letter if the sponsor does not
                        have an established transfer procedure. Completed documents are sent to the PI and
                        Department allowing five days grace before assumed concurrence, and then submitted
                        to the corresponding sponsor immediately. The OSP staff maintains contact with each
                        sponsor and PI to ensure documents are received and processed in a timely manner.
                        The PI should be kept informed of the progress as needed.
                     
                     
                     Once the sponsor has officially relinquished the award, the SPA staff will prepare
                        and submit all final financial reports and close the OGA award.
