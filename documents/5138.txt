                     Our student-athletes are achieving unprecedented success in the classroom and also
                        in their respective fields of play. Teams earned a 3.066 department-wide GPA for the
                        spring of 2015, which was the highest cumulative department GPA since the fall of
                        2011! As a department, we have now graduated 170 student-athletes with bachelor's
                        degrees since August 2013. In addition to their success in the classroom, our coaches
                        and student-athletes stay committed to giving back their time and service to our greater
                        Memphis community. For the fifth year in a row, Memphis Tiger student-athletes have
                        had 100% participation in community outreach and engagement with more than 800 community
                        service hours annually.

                        academic support and scholarships to our student-athletes. Additional accomplishments
