Distinguished Advising Award
Nominations
The nomination process is currently closed. Faculty and professional staff members
who advise undergraduate students may be nominated for the award. This award, sponsored
by the University of Memphis Alumni Association, was established to recognize excellent
advising on our campus and it has been a great benefit to our campus that, over the
years, so many faculty and professional advisors have been recognized by students,
alumni, peers and supervisors for excellence in advising.

For more information contact Director of Academic Advising Karen Thurmond at kthurmnd@memphis.edu .

The Award
Every Spring, the University of Memphis Alumni Association honors two outstanding
faculty or professional advisors with the Distinguished Advising Award. Recipients
are given plaques and a stipend. The Distinguished Advising Award is funded and sponsored
by the University of Memphis Alumni Association.

Selection Process
The selection process begins with nominations by UofM faculty, students, and alumni.
The Selection Committee is appointed by the Provost and consists of two faculty, two
professional staff, two administrators, the Director of Academic Advising, and a student
representative. Final candidates are asked to request supporting letters and submit
a dossier.

The Award
Every Spring, the University of Memphis Alumni Association honors four outstanding
faculty with the presentation of the Distinguished Teaching Award. Recipients receive
individual plaques and awards, and their photographs are displayed in the Administration
Building next to the large plaque honoring all those who have previously received
the award. The Distinguished Teaching Award is funded and sponsored by the University
of Memphis Alumni Association.

Selection Process
The selection process begins with nominations by UofM full-time faculty, students,
and alumni. The Distinguished Teaching Award Committee, which includes former award
winners, will select a number of nominees for further consideration. The Committee

Then the Distinguished Teaching Award Committee will review all pertinent data, including
the student evaluations of all courses taught within the past three years, to select
the award winners.
