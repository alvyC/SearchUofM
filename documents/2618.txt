                     The Naval Science program is designed to prepare midshipmen for a career as future
                        officers in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. The courses offered
                        teach the proud heritage of the Naval Services, where they are today, and where they
                        are headed. As well as developing students academically, courses promote the development
                        of leadership and decision making skills.
                     
                     
                     All courses are open to all University of Memphis students regardless of participation
                        in the Naval ROTC Program. It is expected that non-Naval ROTC students understand
                        that the curriculum being taught is directed at preparing future Navy and Marine Corps
                        officers and that all students are expected to maintain the same high standards.
                     
                     
                     A Minor in Naval Science is offered for students at the University of Memphis. Completion
                        of 18 semester hours are required, which do not include Naval Science Laboratories,
                        which are not required for the minor.
                     
                     
                     All students in the Naval ROTC unit, regardless of program, are required to take the
                        Naval Science Laboratory each semester they are in the program, unless other academic
                        requirements prevent attendance.
