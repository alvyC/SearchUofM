                     At the UofM, there's a group of students that would probably laugh out loud if you
                        called them rich. Truth is, they are quite wealthy in a noticeable way. They have
                        tons of moxie.
                     
                     
                     They are the kind of students that have to work three jobs to pay for classes and
                        support family back home, but do it anyway. They are often told by relatives that
                        college isn't important, but go for it anyway. The kind that start their days at 5
                        am and get to bed by 1 am. The kind that have seen an unfair share of hard times,
                        but look on the bright side anyway.  These are hardworking, gutsy students who appreciate
                        support from someone else who also has a little moxie. And that's where you come in!
                     
                     
                     YOUR GIFT CAN CHANGE 1 FUTURE
                     
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Many of our UofM students have moxie and are working full time, juggling many obligations.
                           Particularly our seniors who have put in countless hours in the classrooms and the
                           library, tutoring and study groups, computer and research labs, and possibly even
                           multiple internships.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     This will be your opportunity to sponsor one of these deserving seniors (with 90 or
                        more credit hours and unmet financial need) for one year and help them finally achieve
                        the goal they've been working so hard for – hearing their name read to thousands as
                        they walk across the stage at graduation.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        And just like many other sponsorship opportunities, you will learn about your student
                           as a result of your gift. You'll receive a tailored Impact Report outlining who received
                           your gift, how it helped them, and a personalized Thank You for all your gift meant
                           to your student.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     START YOUR SCHOLARSHIP
                     
                     With each $1,000 gift you give, a deserving senior will feel the support of a community
                        cheering them on, pushing them closer to that dream of graduating with a college degree.
                        And with each $1,000 gift you give, you will be recognized, placing an indelible mark
                        in UofM history and on the story YOUR sponsored senior will tell when sharing what
                        helped them walk across that stage. So if you're ready to start the process, here's the rundown:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           
                           Your gift must be $1,000 or more. If you give $2,000 annually, you help TWO deserving
                              students. $3000 = 3 students. You get the drill!
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           There are many payment avenues and options available. Give online through using the
                              Give Now link. Or, call the office at 901.678.3953 to set up a more customized installment
                              plan.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           Your gift MUST be paid within the same calendar year. So before you usher in the new
                              year with loved ones on New Year's Eve, just make sure you've submitted your final
                              payment!
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           This is an annual giving program. So re-up and sponsor a new student every year to
                              add to your UofM family tree.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     BENEFITS:
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           
                           You'll receive an annual report each year – detailing the impact your gift made has
                              made for each student you sponsor.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           At the $1,000 giving level, you automatically become a member of the President's Society
                              and receive all the benefits that come with that membership.
