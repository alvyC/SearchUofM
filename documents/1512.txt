                     For Official University Advisors Only: As advisors to students within your department, you serve as an invaluable connection
                        to the university for your students. To facilitate ongoing communication with your
                        student and to provide timely assistance to students in need of help, we have developed
                        the Early Intervention System (EIS). EIS is a computerized wake-up call to students
                        who may need extra help. The system is designed to signal the need for assistance
                        before a student falls too far behind. When an alert is issued on a student that you
                        advise, an email will be automatically generated to:
                     
                     
                       1) the student,
                     
                       2) the student's college advisor, and
                     
                       3) Center for Academic Retention and Enrichment Services.
                     
                     Your college's central advisor may then forward the email to you or may handle the
                        follow-up with the student themselves.
                     
                     
                     You are not alone in this process. Via this site, we will provide you with resources
                        and information that can help you assist struggling students before it is too late.
                        We appreciate your assistance in helping our students be successful!
