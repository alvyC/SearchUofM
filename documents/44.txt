                        students. They come largely because of our extraordinary professors, small classes,
                        and never-ending opportunities to do research in a variety of disciplines. Our students
                        are award winners, having won the Truman, Goldwater, Fulbright, and Rotary scholarships
                        in recent years, as well as major campus awards. And that is what the Helen Hardin
                        Honors Program is about — providing intellectual challenge and opportunities for outstanding
                        students.
                     
                     
                     Our Namesake, Mrs. Helen Hardin
                     
                     Helen Hardin was passionate about the city of Memphis. She and her husband, Jabie
                        Hardin, were also longtime supporters of the University of Memphis. Before her death
                        at the age of 95, Helen Hardin gave a significant gift to the University for the benefit
                        of honors students; in recognition of her generosity, the program was named the Helen
                        Hardin Honors Program. In both life and death, Mrs. Hardin helped shape a better Memphis.
                        As co-founder of wholesale food distributor Hardin's-Sysco, Mrs. Hardin was known
                        for her entrepreneurial spirit, and she was the perfect role model for honors students.
                        The Hardin legacy lives on in this honors-only academic environment that encourages
                        hard work, rigorous study and high expectations.
