                     Dear Faculty and Staff:
                     
                     Here's a quick update on summer enrollment. The 2016 unduplicated headcount stands
                        at 5,595 compared to 5,363 in 2015, a total of 4.3% growth this year. Total credit
                        hours stand at 32,557 as compared to 31,536 in 2015, representing growth of 3.2%.
                        Overall, we gained considerable ground with continuing students, online, off campus
                        (Collierville) and our 3+3 program. We have a total of 4,658 continuing students enrolled
                        this summer, the highest since 2011. UofM online enrollment reached 3,215 students
                        generating 9,226 credit hours. Online enrollment, including RODP, is up 11% year-to-date.
                        Off-campus course enrollment continues to outpace last year (up more than 26%) with
                        Collierville enrollment up more than 40%. A total of 274 students took advantage of
                        the 3+3 program, a 48% increase over last year. All colleges/schools have surpassed
                        2015 course enrollment headcounts except Fogelman College of Business & Economics,
                        which is down about 11%, and the College of Education, which is flat year after year.
                        As this data indicates, we are making some meaningful progress.
                     
                     
                     Graduation numbers have also increased. Although the certification numbers for the
                        Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law have not been completed, we have certified 2,194
                        degrees thus far for May 2016 and are on track to easily surpass the 2,204 degrees
                        from May 2015.
                     
                     
                     Additionally, for the upcoming fall semester, the anticipated housing occupancy has
                        increased 12.9%. That equates to approximately 199 rooms.
                     
                     
                     Thank you for your hard work, innovation and commitment to our students.
