                     Students who have scored 26 or higher on the speaking portion of the TOEFL iBT are
                        not required to take the SPEAK test. A score of 23 - 25 on the speaking portion of
                        the TOEFL iBT is equivalent to a score of 45 on the SPEAK test.  Students scoring
                        in this range can teach for one semester but must take the SPEAK test before further
                        teaching.  At this time IELTS speaking scores are not being accepted as proof of English
                        speaking ability for assistantships. 
                     
                     
                     *You may be asked to take the SPEAK test even if English is one of the official languages
                        of your country.  These are handled on a case-by-case basis.
