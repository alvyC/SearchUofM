ABOUT THE HISPANIC ALUMNI COUNCIL




The University of Memphis Alumni Association welcomes our newest club, the Hispanic
Alumni Council, to our Tiger family. The Hispanic Alumni Council (HAC) works tirelessly
to exemplify the broader role of Hispanics within the University of Memphis community.

HAC is devoted to the advancement and development of current students and alumni of
the University of Memphis. The community and the HAC are empowered with each Hispanic
graduate of the University of Memphis. The goal of the Council is to build and connect
a network of Hispanic alumni from the University of Memphis and to foster scholarships
for students at the University of Memphis. These scholarships will help to create
and realize possibilities for a new generation of Hispanic students.

The Hispanic Alumni Council urges everyone to get involved. Please join and help to
expand, diversify and strengthen the Tiger network. Check back for more information
about upcoming activities.





THE HISPANIC ALUMNI COUNCIL SCHOLARSHIP




The deadline to apply for the 2016-2017 HAC Scholarship has passed. 
The scholarship will be awarded to undergraduate students attending the University
of Memphis who exhibit strong involvement and engagement with the University of Memphis
and the Hispanic community. Interested candidates must be full-time students. The
undergraduate applicant must possess a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.5.
