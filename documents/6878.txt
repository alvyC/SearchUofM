                     The supply and demand of IS professors shifted in the last decade. Understanding the
                     fluctuation of the IS faculty job market is a critical success factor for future planning
                     and recruitment efforts. This paper presents the results of a longitudinal study that
                     monitored the supply and demand of IS professors between 1992 and 2004. Data, primarily
                     from the AIS and ICIS placement services, were analyzed to identify the trends in
                     this market. Other relevant issues such as the composition of IS faculty position
                     applicants, supply of IS doctorates, and trends in IS professor salary are also discussed.
                     The paper concludes with recommendations to business and IS schools based on the findings.
