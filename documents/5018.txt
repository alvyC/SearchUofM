                     What is BlockChain?
                     
                     Blockchain Technology (also known as distributed ledger) is a game changer. Until
                        now, there has not been a technology to deploy a viable, shared, smart distributed
                        ledger that is safe and that we can all share. The ledger records a listing of physical
                        and/or virtual holdings as Digital Assets. These Digital Assets can be tied to a fiat
                        currency, digital currency, gold, diamonds, securities, IP, house, car, license, good,
                        service, thing, or some other instrument of exchange or value. S​mart contracts​,
                        available on the Ethereum blockchain fabric, ​enable corporations to connect events
                        and data, and to take automatic action. ​They manage automatic workflow execution
                        and make operations more efficient. Blockchain transactions create a tamper-proof
                        log record and they decrease incidents of fraud. All blockchain transactions provide
                        the source or origin of a transaction which may be as simple as who sent a message.
                        Blockchain allows us to augment existing data technologies with immutability and provenance.
                        ​Blockchain technologies are strategic. Firms across all industries are using them
                        to set off another wave of reengineering effort, decrease risk, increase efficiency
                        as it automates long-lived transactions and remove human error, increase visibility
                        and transparency, reduce the possibility of fraud, and to provide a chain of custody
                        around assets in their supply chain.
                     
                     
                     Why Learn Blockchain?
                     
                     In a modern cyber security infrastructure it is critical that transactions be as secure
                        as possible. Because of the insular nature of the data and the numerous fail-safes
                        built into these systems, blockchain is increasingly becoming a critical component
                        of online transactions. Any company that deals in the transaction of currency online
                        should be familiar with the technology.

                     What Will I take away?
                     
                     The participants will learn how blockchain technology is disrupting existing business
                        models and will gain insights in paradigmatic changes occurring from economic, organizational,
                        and computer science viewpoints. As a result, the participants will be able to develop
                        their own, new value creating information systems, which are designed as decentralized
                        autonomous systems. As learning outcomes, the participants will receive computer science,
                        information systems, and business knowledge background in order to analyze existing
                        business processes and their potential to convert them into Blockchain-based solutions.
                        In doing so, they will be able to co-create new blockchain-based cryptographic economic
                        systems.
