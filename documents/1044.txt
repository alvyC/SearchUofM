                     The University of Memphis is fully committed to the concept and practice of equal
                           opportunity and affirmative action in all aspects of employment. The Affirmative Action
                           Program is organized in compliance with several federal and state laws, executive
                           orders and implementing regulations. As a federal contractor, the University is required
                           to have a written affirmative action compliance program. The program must include
                           identification and analysis of problem areas, the establishment of goals and timetables,
