                     Graduate Certificate Program in Software Testing
                     
                     Software testing is a critical discipline as organizations increasingly rely on information
                        systems that are becoming increasingly more complex. This certificate prepares students
                        to both manage and participate in testing at all stages of the software development
                        process. The topics and techniques are applicable to testing all types of software.
