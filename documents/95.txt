                           attendees with a comprehensive toolkit for applying R to business intelligence data
                           solutions. R is a language widely used by statisticians and data miners for developing

                           to meet a critical need among corporations and nonprofits for a deep quantitative
                           analysis tool kit designed to meet the rising big data challenges faced by all organizations.
