                     James Baldwin, buried in 1987, often looks like today's most vital and beloved new
                        African American author. This lecture will explore the reasons behind Baldwin's resurrection,
                        from his elevated place in the cultural memory of the Black Lives Matter movement,
                        to his function as an antidote to the frozen time of Afro-Pessimism, to his status
                        as an icon of state surveillance and racial counter-surveillance.

                     Inequality in contemporary society clashes with the growing belief in the value of
                        social equality. What is the history of inequality? This talk describes the research
                        design and preliminary results of the CHIA study of socio-economic inequality worldwide
                        since 1600 CE. More broadly, it asks, is inequality functional for human society,
                        or does it cause waste?

                        Reception at 5:30 PM, Lecture at 6:00 PM
                        
                     
                     
                     Forty years ago, southern Chile's Archipelago of Chiloé was a rural, politically marginalized
                        province of little economic import to most Chileans. Today it is one of the world's
                        leading exporters of farmed salmon and an increasingly popular destination for tourists.
                        This rapid shift into the global economy has triggered a series of social and environmental
                        crises that came to a peak in May of this year when protesters cut off access to the
                        archipelago for more than two weeks. Drawing on participant observation fieldwork
                        and repeated visits to Chiloé from 2002 to 2016, this lecture traces the recent history
                        of the archipelago and discuss the cultural and economic challenges that globalization
                        has created for residents of this unique austral region.
