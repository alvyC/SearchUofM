                     Travel and Travel Reimbursements: A Shared Responsibility
                     
                     The Shared Services Center (SSC) is currently providing support for domestic in-state
                        and out-of-state travel, international, and blanket travel for staff and faculty travel
                        only within the following pilot departments: ITD, Lambuth, and the College of Arts
                        and Sciences.
                     
                     
                     Note: Travel, within the SSC, is a multi-faceted process. Any business trip which
                        includes reimbursement will involve different people/units, depending on where in
                        the cycle the travel planning or reimbursement is located.
                     
                     
                     The Traveler's responsibilities include:
                     
                     
                        
                        Obtaining prior authorization to travel from an administrative superior or other administrative
                           official.
                        
                        
                        Submitting initial P.O. requests via the helpdesk no fewer than 14 days advance of
                           departure date (Domestic). As of November 1, 2014 International requires 21 days advance
                           of departure date.
                        
                        
                        Completing all necessary information on the Helpdesk ticket and electronically attaching
                           any required receipts.
