                     Dr. Melissa Janoske Selected For Prestigious Plank Center Fellowship
                     
                     June 20, 2016 - Dr. Melissa Janoske, assistant professor in the University of Memphis
                        Department of Journalism and Strategic Media, has been awarded the prestigious Fellowship
                        for Educators by the Plank Center for Leadership in Public Relations. 
                     
                     
                     As part of the fellowship, General Motors in Detroit will host Janoske for two weeks
                        in July. This fall, a public relations professional from General Motors will come
                        to the University of Memphis to work with PR professors and students.
                     
                     
                     "We developed the summer fellowship specifically for public relations educators with
                        the dual purpose of exposing professors to current day-to-day operations of the public
                        relations function and to help create an exchange of information and ideas that will
                        enhance the professional development of both the educators and the hosts," said Keith
                        Burton, vice chair of the Plank Center and principal of Grayson Emmett Partners.
                     
                     
                     During the fellowship, educators participate in research projects, training sessions
                        and presentations, and assist with company projects. In return, practitioners from
                        the host organization visit the educator's campus to interact with faculty, staff
                        and students to share industry knowledge, trends and valuable insight.
                     
                     
                     Janoske teaches a variety of public relations courses, including a new class in crisis
                        communication. She earned a PhD from the University of Maryland in 2014, writing her
                        dissertation on how online communities formed and aided individuals and organizations
                        with crisis response and recovery.
