                     Department of History
                     
                     The Department of History introduces students to the richness and complexity of the
                        human experience through a curriculum that covers all major geographic areas and time
                        periods, and emphasizes both the unity of that experience and the diversity resulting
                        from such factors as cultural, social, and gender differences. We seek to develop
                        not only a knowledge of the past, but also an appreciation of history as an intellectual
                        discipline that employs a wide variety of scholarly methodologies in its effort to
                        understand that past. Students are taught to think and work as historians: to read
                        critically and analytically both primary and secondary sources, to appreciate the
                        complexity of historical issues and multiplicity of historical views, and to investigate
                        a historical question or problem and communicate the results of that investigation.
                        Through this broad preparation, history majors acquire essential knowledge and critical
                        skills, which provide valuable assets for a wide spectrum of professions and occupations
                        as well as the fundamental basis for advanced study. Program objectives for a B.A.
                        in History are: (a) a fundamental knowledge of the past, including key historical
                        events, ideas, figures, movements, and periods; (b) an awareness of the diversity
                        of historical experiences over time and space; (c) the ability to recognize, locate,
                        analyze critically, and utilize primary and secondary sources; (d) the ability to
                        recognize and evaluate differing historical interpretations and methodologies; (e)
                        the ability to research a topic thoroughly using both primary and secondary sources,
                        and to present a clear and well-written historical argument based on that research;
                        (f) express a high degree of satisfaction with the quality of the education received
                        in that program.

                        hours of lower division history, and maintained a grade point average of at least
                        3.25 in overall studies and in history courses taken, are eligible for admission to
                        the honors program in history. Students admitted to the program must take 15 hours

                        honors-level requirements. Those who successfully complete the program and the regular

                     ** This plan assumes you are starting your language courses at the intermediate (2010/2020)
                        level required for the degree. If you need to start your language sequence at an earlier
                        level, please account for that and plug those courses into the plan. This will require
                        that you remove one to two "elective" slots and replace them with the necessary language
                        courses.
