                     About Critical Conversations
                     
                     I am struck each and every day by the diversity of our campus and how profoundly this
                        campus enriches our lives and community. I want to take this opportunity to let you
                        know how much I appreciate the uniqueness and creativity that each and every one of
                        you bring to our campus and the City of Memphis. I believe that we are all blessed
                        to be a part of this tremendous university and that, by virtue of our interactions
                        and relationships with people who are often very different than ourselves we are able
                        to expand our horizons and experience a richer life. However, the midst of our very
                        busy lives, it is often difficult to let others know that they are valued, that they
                        are safe, and that they are appreciated on our campus.
                     
                     
                     Events in Ferguson and New York, along with a number of violent episodes on university
                        campuses around the country, have focused attention on a range of issues critical
                        to our democratic, civil society. Despite assurances in our Constitution, issues of
                        freedom, prejudice, equity and fairness continue to reverberate on our campus, in
                        our community and across our county. The University of Memphis is in a unique position
                        to weigh in and offer leadership. Our unique history and mission, coupled with the
                        intellectual capital available on our campus, make us a natural leader on such critical
                        conversations. Accordingly, I'm asking our Provost, in coordination with our own Hooks
                        Institute, to examine the best format for hosting a campus conversation on these critical
                        issues. I would like to see us become a national leader for these initiatives and
                        for us to serve as a model for colleges and universities across the country. The hope
                        is that this conversation will inform our university policies related to violence,
                        diversity and equality.
