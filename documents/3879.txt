							Soldering: What is it?
                                
							
								
									
			
				Soldering is the joining of two metal surfaces using a filler metal (solder) to connect the materials at the joint. The filler metal will have a lower melting point than the adjoining metals.

Isn't that welding?

Welding requires that you melt the pieces that you wish to join. Soldering is the melting of an intermediary metal to make the connection (like metal glue).
