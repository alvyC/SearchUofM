                     Some of our forms have submit options. After completing the form using the downloading,
                        completing, and saving steps above, you are able to click the submit button. If you
                        are using Internet Explorer, there is no need to download forms with submit buttons
                        - these forms open in IE, and can be completed and submitted from your IE browser.
                        Form without submit buttons will need to be downloaded and saved to your desktop.
                     
                     
                     *Please remember it is a good idea to use the Save As function each new time you complete
                        the form, giving each instance a unique identifier that you and your department will
                        recognize. EH&S suggests that you Save As or print a copy of each instance for your
                        department's records.
