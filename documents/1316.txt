                           into nurturing characteristics that exist in schools and standards and assessment

                           five (5) years to prepare principals for urban schools using a non-traditional approach.

                           superintendent/board relationships, school district restructuring, and the effects
                           of nurturing characteristics on the academic achievement of students.
