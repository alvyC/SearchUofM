Make A Contribution

Every membership includes a contribution to the UofM Alumni
Association Scholarship Endowment. Thanks to our members, the Association awards $12,000 in scholarships each year. In addition, our clubs and chapters host events throughout the year to raise money for the scholarships they provide.

In addition to your membership and attending events, you can make an annual donation to a particular scholarship. Your support makes a difference. Annual donations of any amount to a scholarship fund support students and directly enhance the prestige of our university by:

    Increasing our alumni participation rate - an important factor in determining the UofM's national rank each year
    Helping to attract top students and faculty

To promote student success and help the University of Memphis to continue to rise in the rankings, BECOME A MEMBER and DONATE TODAY .
