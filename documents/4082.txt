                        hour values require the following minimum number of contact minutes:

                     Determining Minimum Requirements
                     
                     To determine if a course offering meets the minimum contact minutes requirement:
                     
                     
                        
                        Count the number of days the course meets during the part of term (POT). Refer to
                           the appropriate Dates and Deadlines calendar to determine the first and last class
                           meetings for the course as well as semester breaks and holidays.   Note : For the Full POT, do not count the exam period.
                        
                        Multiply (#Mtngs) x (Min per Mtng). If the product is not at least equal to the minimum
                           figure from the table above, then you must add meeting minutes to meet the minimum.
                             Caution : If you must add minutes, be sure not to overlap another class meeting time and create
                              a time conflict for students. Note :   It takes 2 lab hours to equal 1 lecture hour.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Contact Minute Shortages
                     
                     The following 3-hour courses in current or upcoming terms are known to be short of
                        the 2250 minimum contact minutes:
