                     UofM, Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare and Shelby County Schools Create Partnership
                     
                     July 29, 2016 - The University of Memphis, Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare and Shelby
                        County Schools have created a partnership designed to help inspire and prepare the
                        next generation of healthcare professionals. Central High School will develop a dual enrollment program to prepare students for
                        the health science, healthcare administration, healthcare law and nursing fields. Methodist
                        Healthcare will provide resources for classrooms and teachers for the dual enrollment
                        courses.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis will supply quality instructors to teach the courses. Central
                        High School students also will have opportunities to work in facilities at the UofM
                        and at Methodist University Hospital, benefitting from mentoring by physicians and
                        other clinicians. Offering increased opportunities for local students also will help
                        attract and retain high-quality, well-prepared employees in the healthcare sector,
                        while supporting multiple priorities of the District's Destination 2025 strategic
                        plan.
                     
                     
                     "The University of Memphis recognizes the value of making strategic investments in
                        the lives of this city's young people, providing them an engaging academic experience,
                        and preparing them for successful careers in the thriving healthcare industry," said
                        President M. David Rudd. "We are pleased to join Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare and
                        Central High School in this exciting partnership."
                     
                     
                     Gary Shorb, CEO of Methodist Le Bonheur, said, "This new partnership strengthens each
                        institution in immeasurable ways by allowing each of us to extend our own missions
                        in the community. We're eager to do whatever we can to help prepare today's high schoolers
                        for lives of learning and success, as doing so will only strengthen the recruiting
                        efforts of the University of Memphis and help prepare a strong, knowledgeable workforce
                        for the growing health sciences sector. Likewise, we hope that by partnering with
                        Central in such a meaningful way, we can help provide resources that further enhance
                        the school's educational experience, and situate Central as one of the premier high
                        schools in the city."
                     
                     
                     Greg McCullough, principal of Central High School, added, "This is a great partnership
                        that will help give our students opportunities in health care and nursing with real
                        professionals in real professional settings. This is a wonderful program for our students
                        and for Shelby County Schools."
