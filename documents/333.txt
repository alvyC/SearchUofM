                     Application and Audition Process
                     
                     Admission to the BFA in theatre at the University of Memphis is a two step process.
                        Students should apply first to the University of Memphis and then separately to the
                        Department of Theatre & Dance. Current Memphis students wishing to transfer into,

                        to the University of Memphis. When applying to the department students should choose
                        between three areas of study:
