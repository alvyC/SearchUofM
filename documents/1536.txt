                     General parking is available on campus and a permit is included in the cost of tuition. 
                        Students will receive a permit in the mail prior to their first semester of classes. 
                        If registered before the deadline, students will receive subsequent permit stickers
                        for the remaining semesters that they are enrolled.  If students would like to park
                        in priority lots, including the parking garages, they will need to apply for a priority
                        parking permit with the Parking Services office.  These spots are limited and students should apply as soon as possible for
                        these permits.
