                     Dear Campus Community:
                     
                     As you are aware, the Focus on College and University Success (FOCUS) legislation
                        has been finalized. The law allows for an independent governing board at the University of Memphis and other TBR
                        member universities. The legislation enables the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR)
                        to maintain a "sharpened focus" on the state's community and technical colleges, increases
                        autonomy and local control for TBR universities, and strengthens the Tennessee Higher
                        Education Commission. The legislation includes a restructuring of the Tennessee Board
                        of Regents, which establishes local governing boards for the six universities currently
                        under the oversight of TBR allowing the University of Memphis to establish its own
                        governing board in 2017.
                     
                     
                     We welcome the autonomy that the FOCUS Act will provide the University of Memphis.
                        A transition taskforce has been formed to facilitate the move to an independent governing
                        board and is co-chaired by Melanie Murry, our general counsel, and David Zettergren,
                        vice president for business and finance. The taskforce is addressing policy and related
                        administrative issues and is serving in an advisory capacity. See a listing of members
                        of the Taskforce via a link at the left.
                     
                     
                     I am proud to have the opportunity to serve with all of you. As we prepare for the
                        transition to independent governing boards with the FOCUS Act, we will continue to
                        focus on the reasons we're here – student success, knowledge creation, research innovation
                        and community service.
