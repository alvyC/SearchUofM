                     Why Give?
                     
                     There are many reasons to support the University of Memphis. The common denominator:
                        They all provide our margin of excellence so that we can better serve our students
                        and faculty and do more for our state, region, nation and the world.
                     
                     
                     Be Recognized
                     
                     The University of Memphis has established several recognition societies to thank donors
                        for their generosity. Unless anonymity is requested, donors' names are often listed
                        in donor appreciation publications.
                     
                     
                     Our Giving Societies are: • Blue and Grey Society • President's Society • Columns Society • Centennial Circle • Mynders Society • Brister Society • Manning Society
                     
                     
                     Provide Critical Revenue
                     
                     You may think University of Memphis needs minimal support from private donors. After
                        all, as a state university, we receive funding from the Tennessee legislature, and
                        we also get revenue from other sources. But our annual state appropriations, which
                        made up a large part of our revenue for almost a decade, have steadily decreased.
                        Meantime, our portion of revenue that comes from student tuition and fees has increased
                        until last year. The message is clear: Private giving must increase to help offset
                        state budget cuts and lessen the need for higher student tuition and fees if we're
                        to sustain our tradition of excellence and access.
                     
                     
                     Support Our Priorities
                     
                     We value and welcome gifts of all types and sizes.
                     
                     Donors who want to make gifts that require minimal guidance can make a gift to the
                        Academic Fund or a specific University area. Most often, these are gifts that we can
                        put to use immediately to help students and faculty. Please make your gift today .
                     
                     
                     Donors who want to make gifts that require more consultation – such as creating an
                        endowed scholarship or making a planned estate gift – please contact the Director of Development .

            "It's important to contribute to your university because it shows how proud you are
               of the school you go to. Memphis has provided me with opportunities I would have never
               had anywhere else. It would be a shame to not give back to the school that gives its
               students a chance to succeed!"
