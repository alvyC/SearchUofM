                        at risk-students with an academic coach for individual bi-weekly meetings throughout
                        a semester. Graduate students specializing in counseling-related fields and selected
                        faculty and staff will receive professional development and mentoring to equip them
                        with the tools necessary to guide students in the development of their academic and
                        career goals.
                     
                     
                     The three interrelated goals of the ACE program are:
                     
                     
                        
                        (1) to help students to develop a clear vision of their own goals and degree path,
                        
                        (2) to assist students in developing skills related to academic success, such as study
                           skills, time management, and self-efficacy; and
                        
                        
                        (3) to connect them to other university resources and support personnel as needed.
                        
                     
                     
                     These goals are accomplished through the following five student learning outcomes
                        in which students will:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        (1) demonstrate improvement in academic self-efficacy;
                        
                        (2) show an increase in resiliency (grit);
                        
                        (3) demonstrate an increase in educational commitment;
                        
                        (4) demonstrate improvement in time management; and
                        
                        (5) identify an academic pathway to degree completion. 
                        
                     
                     
                     The QEP topic emerged from campus-wide discussions related to the institution's strategic
                        plan as well as increasing student retention and success. Within this institutional
                        context, the QEP Selection Committee carefully considered several proposed topics,
                        and endorsed academic coaching as the QEP theme based upon the encouraging results
                        of a pilot study that provided academic coaching to at-risk freshmen.
