                     The University of Memphis Department of Theatre & Dance presents one the greatest
                        of French farces, perhaps the greatest farce ever written. A Flea In Her Ear, a hilarious
                        farce by Georges Feydeau, adaptation by David Ives. Directed by third-year MFA candidate
                        Meredith Melville, A Flea in Her Ear will take you for a wild comedic ride! Suspicions
                        of infidelity lead to mistaken identities, narrow escapes, secret rendezvous at the
                        Frisky Puss Hotel, crazy coincidences and little lies that grow bigger by the minute.
                        Shows run April 14-16 and April 21-23, 2016 , Thursdays-Saturdays at 7:30 p.m.
                     
                     
                     Winner of a 2006 Jefferson Award for best adaptation. "Ives' adaptation maintains
