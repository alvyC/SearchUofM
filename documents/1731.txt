                     The University of Memphis Department of Theatre & Dance presents one the greatest
                        of French farces, perhaps the greatest farce ever written. A Flea In Her Ear, a hilarious
                        farce by Georges Feydeau, adaptation by David Ives. Directed by third-year MFA candidate
                        Meredith Melville, A Flea in Her Ear will take you for a wild comedic ride! Suspicions

                        Frisky Puss Hotel, crazy coincidences and little lies that grow bigger by the minute.
                        Shows run April 14-16 and April 21-23, 2016 , Thursdays-Saturdays at 7:30 p.m.
