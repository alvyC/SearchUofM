The University of Memphis Campus Identification Cards POLICIES

Issued:  December 2, 2015 Responsible Official:  Vice President for Business & Finance Responsible Office:  Bursar Policy Statement Policy The University operates and maintains a computerized, campus wide identification card (Campus Card) system in which cards are created and issued to students, faculty, staff, retired employees and approved guests of the University.  On campus students should have a Campus Card to utilize the campus computerized door access system, stored value funds, and other associated rights and privileges offered by the University.  Every Campus Card holder is subject to the following conditions:
