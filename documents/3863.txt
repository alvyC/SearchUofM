									PLEASE READ BEFORE REQUESTING ROOM USE
The primary purpose of the McWherter Library Instruction Rooms (ML 225 & ML 226) is for Library Instruction, and our Room Use Policies are designed to ensure that the rooms will be available for library instruction. 


	
	Requests for library instruction should be made as early as possible and must be made at least a week in advance to ensure librarian and room availability, and to give the librarian ample time to prepare for the class.
	
	
	Regularly-scheduled meetings or classes will not be pre-scheduled in the Instruction Center.
	
	
	The Instruction Center may be limited to library instruction use during September, October, January and February, as these are the busiest months for library instruction.
	
	
	Requests for non-library-instruction use will not be scheduled more than one week in advance. Exceptions may be made if the requested date falls within the last four weeks of the semester (including Finals week).
	
	
	A University of Memphis employee must be listed as the responsible party and must be present in the room at all times. Students may not schedule the instruction rooms and are not allowed to use the rooms without a faculty or staff member present.
	
	
	No food or drink is allowed in the Instruction Center.
