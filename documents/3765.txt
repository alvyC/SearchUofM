                       Peer Recognition Award
                     
                     
                     The Peer Recognition Awards program has been established in order to encourage departmental
                        unity. This program provides an opportunity for employees to recognize each other
                        for outstanding service. This is a very special award – an award given by a peer to
                        a peer. Peer recognition is not a nomination process – it is an awarding process.
                        Individuals may award others from within or outside their department – as long as
                        both individuals are part of Academic Affairs and have at least one year of regular
                        service with the University. Employees may present four Peer Awards, per semester.
                        Employees may not award two Peer Awards to the same individual within an awarding
                        year. Nominations for the Peer Recognition Award are accepted throughout the year.
                        However, a call for participation will periodically be distributed to all staff in
                        Academic Affairs. All employees within the Academic Affairs Division are eligible
                        to participate in the Peer Recognition Awards program, both as presenters and recipients.
                        Recipients should be recognized for outstanding student, staff, departmental, or university
                        service. The awards will be presented on an ongoing basis. All individuals receiving
                        this will also be recognized during the Awards Ceremony. The recipient of this award
                        will receive a certificate of recognition and the three recipients with the highest
                        number (two or more) of peer recognitions at the end of the awarding year will be
                        eligible for the pool of nominations for the Provost's Star Award. In the event of
                        a tie, all recipients who qualify (i.e. have at least two nominations) will be eligible
                        for the pool of nominations for the Provost's Star Award. Those awarding are strongly
                        encouraged to also present the recipient with a small token of appreciation (i.e.
                        lunch, candy, fruit basket, special card, etc.). Click here to present an award .
                     
                     
                       Provost's Star Award
                     
                     
                     The purpose of the Provost's Star Award is to recognize an individual for outstanding
                        contributions toward achieving the mission of the division. The recipient of the Provost's
                        Star Award will be selected from the pool of winners of the Outstanding Service Awards
                        and the top three Peer Recognition Award recipients. An employee can receive this
                        award once every three years. The Academic Affairs Awards Committee will select the
                        winner of this award for the academic year. When determining the Provost's Star Award,
                        the Academic Affairs Awards Committee may also consider a candidate's Peer Recognition
                        Award(s) when they make their final decision. This award will be presented during
                        the Awards Ceremony. The recipient will receive a plaque and a $150 monetary award.
                        The recipient's name will be placed on a plaque displayed in a public place in Wilder
                        Tower Lobby. Use this form to submit nominations and to view further instructions.
                     
                     
                       Student Appreciation and Recognition
                     
                     
                     The purpose of this recognition is to show our student employees and graduate assistants
                        that we appreciate their hard work and contributions. This recognition will not be
                        a selective acknowledgement. All student employees and graduate assistants will be
                        acknowledged. The Academic Affairs Awards Committee has designated the last full week
                        of classes in April as Student Appreciation Week. Each department may decide how they
                        want to honor the students. This may include small gifts, lunch, or pizza party and,
                        should occur during Student Appreciation Week. A Certificate of Appreciation will
                        be given to all student employees and graduate assistants during Student Appreciation
                        Week.
