                     The approach to training designers at The University of Memphis fosters the development
                        of our students on an individual basis. The size of the department allows for students
                        to have dynamic design and production opportunities both in the classroom and in our
                        three performance spaces, without being lost in the shuffle. Our diverse faculty nurtures
                        the individual progress of each student through course work, design assignments and
                        advising that is sensitive to the needs and growth of each student.
                     
                     
                     The Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) Degree in Design & Technology at the University of
                        Memphis is a program specifically designed for students whose interests and abilities
                        strongly suggest potential for pursuing careers as artists for the  professional theatre
                        and entertainment industries. The curriculum is structured to introduce students to
                        all aspects of theatre and grow towards a specialization. Students learn from dedicated
                        faculty, often as apprentices, and have ample opportunities to produce realized work.
                        The variety and nature of the resources available to student artists are of professional
                        caliber, allowing the motivated student to develop the skills necessary for a career
                        in theatre.
                     
                     
                     The goal of the design and production curriculum is to help students develop a designer's
                        eye and the craft skills necessary to creating professional level productions. Design
                        and technology students should leave after four years with a suitable portfolio to
                        submit for consideration for professional employment or for admission to a Masters
                        of Fine Arts program. Students are provided a list of competencies in the Undergraduate
                        Handbook that help them assess their progress. As well, all design students are provided
                        feedback on their progress though an annual portfolio review and through advising.
                        It is understood that students graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Design and
                        Technical Production will have had an opportunity to design at least one fully realized
                        production in the area of their specialty in addition to other projects.
