                     Important News from the Commencement Office
                     
                     
                        
                        Undergraduate Diplomas only reflect the degree and any honors distinctions and departmental
                           honors. Majors and Concentrations are available on your transcripts ONLY.
                        
                        
                        Some Graduate Diplomas, including Doctoral degrees, list the degree only on the diploma.
                           Majors and Concentrations are available on your transcripts.
                        
                        
                        All students in the program are walking based on their prior semester GPA. Any changes
                           in honors will be reflected on the Undergraduate Diploma at the time of certification.
                           Graduate School Diplomas do NOT denote any honors.
                        
                        
                        Spring graduation may conflict with the Grizzlies playoff schedule, so there could
                           be a possible date change. If you are graduating in the spring semester, read about
                           it here.
                        
                        
                        Second majors and second concentrations do not participate in the Commencement ceremony.
                           They do not walk. They are not listed in the program and they do not receive a second
                           diploma. For example, in May 2011, student received a Bachelor of Professional Studies
                           with a concentration Health Services degree, and returned in May 2012 and added a
                           concentration within Professional Studies. In May 2012, student received a Bachelor
                           of Arts degree with a major in English, and returns in December 2012 and gets a second
                           major in History. These are the same degree, so no second diploma, program name or
                           participation.
                        
                        
                        Graduate Certificate ONLY students do not participate in the Commencement ceremony.
                           Names are listed in the spring Commencement program only.
                        
                        
                        Step 4 - Completion of the Step 4 is required for both students participating in the
                           Commencement ceremony (attending) and for students not planning to participate (not
                           attending). This includes all levels of students: doctoral, masters, specialists,
                           law and undergraduates. Attendance is collected by semester so only the current semester
                           graduating student fills out the form. Ceremony attendance information will be collected
                           by the Commencement Office during the middle of your graduating semester. See below
                           for when you need to fill out your card.
                        
                        
                        If you are applying to graduate in spring (May) -The May Commencement always has the
                           possibility of changing dates due to the Grizzlies playoff schedule. Please plan and
                           have guests plan accordingly (Saturday or Sunday event possibility). If you are graduating
                           in the May (spring) Commencement ceremonies, we highly recommend and encourage you
                           to speak to your guests to plan for Commencement weekend, pending further information
                           regarding the Grizzlies NBA Playoff Schedule. We recommend booking any return flights
                           (transportation) either late on Sunday (depending on the graduating students college
                           or school) or Monday morning following Commencement. Please share the spring possible
                           back-up-date information with all guests (immediate and extended family and friends).

                           and times will be sent out via the graduating students Memphis email account, on our
