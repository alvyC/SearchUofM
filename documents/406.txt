                     The University of Memphis offers two Anthropology degrees:
                     
                     Students pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology have the opportunity for training in three of the four subfields: cultural and biological
                        anthropology, and archaeology. Students can also take advantage of numerous opportunities
                        for enriched learning such as internships, service-learning, and study abroad. Students with diverse interests
                        will find anthropology to be a stimulating major or minor, with relevance for understanding
                        pressing real world issues. In our last Senior Exit Survey students were 100% satisfied
                        with the accessibility of faculty and 94% satisfied with the quality of teaching.
                     
                     
                     Students pursuing a Master of Arts in Anthropology join a nationally-recognized applied program. Students benefit from opportunities
                        to work directly with local organizations, and gain experience in community development,
                        environmental justice and sustainability, cultural identity and heritage, health disparities,
                        healthcare systems, health risk and business anthropology. The networks, knowledge,
                        and experience students build is invaluable for future employment. In a 2014 survey,
                        90% of alumni from the MA program reported that they were satisfied with the quality
                        of their education, and over 84% say their MA plays a significant role in their overall
                        career satisfaction.
