                     HOW TO "APPLY TO GRADUATE":
                     
                     Visit your MyMemphis portal at:  https://myuofm.memphis.edu/
                     
                     To access the application, click on the MyDegree tab to locate the Commencement and
                        Graduation channel. Follow the prescribed steps listed below:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Carefully review Step 1 - Prerequisites to Graduate.
                        
                        Click on Step 2 - Apply to Graduate to complete application.
                        
                        Once Step 2 has been completed, proceed to Step 3 - Diploma Mailing/Cap and Gown form.
                           All students are required to complete both the Diploma Mailing and Cap and Gown form,
                           even if there are no plans to attend graduation exercises. For students completing
                           only a graduate certificate program, there will be no access to the Cap and Gown portion
                           as these students are not allowed to participate in graduation.
                        
                        
                        During the middle of every semester, the Commencement Office will provide graduating
                           students access to Step 4 - Attendance Card.
                        
                        
                        After the application has been completed, click View Application to Graduate.
                        
                        Proceed to Step 3 only if you need to make changes to your name or to the diploma
                           mailing address. Do not go back to Step 2.
