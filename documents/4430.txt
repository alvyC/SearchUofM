                        are allocated by date of receipt and home address, completed applications accompanied
                        by the required $100 application/reservation deposit should be returned to the Office
                        of Residence Life as soon as possible. Checks or money orders should be made out to

                     Receipt by the Office of Residence Life of the housing application and $100 check
                        or money order, however, does not guarantee admission to the University or to a residence
                        hall. The Director of Residence Life reserves the right to refuse any housing application,
                        to change or cancel any assignment, or to terminate a resident's occupancy for justifiable
                        cause.
                     
                     
                     Contract Period and Conditions: Fall assignment/contracts are for the full academic year (fall and spring semesters).
                        Fall residents wishing to petition for release from their contract for the spring
                        semester must do so in writing by November 1. Residents who cancel after this date,
                        but prior to claiming their key for the spring semester, will forfeit 50% of their
                        application/reservation deposit. Residents who fail to cancel by the close of the
                        check-in period will forfeit the entire $100 deposit. The application/reservation
                        deposit, once submitted with the application, covers the initial term of occupancy
                        and all subsequent terms of occupancy and continues until such time as it is cancelled
                        in writing. There will be no penalty if written cancellation is received prior to
                        the published deadline for any specific contract period.
                     
                     
                     Residents claim and vacate their rooms according to directions issued by the Department
                        of Residence Life. Returning and new residents will have claimed their spaces if any
                        or all of the following procedures have occurred: (1) receiving the room key during
                        the check-in period, (2) paying residence hall rent in full or in part by the end
                        of the check-in period, (3) returning the signed contract with the rental payment.
                     
                     
                     Cancellation Policy: Full deposit and pre-payment of rent will be refunded if: (1) the institution is
                        notified by the following cancellation deadlines for the first semester in which the
                        contract is in force: July 1 for fall residents; December 1 for new spring residents;
                        May 1 for summer residents; (2) the student is prevented from entering the University
                        because of personal medical reasons confirmed in writing by a licensed physician;
                        (3) residence hall space is not available; (4) if the applicant has not been assigned
                        to a room at the time written cancellation is received by Residence Life; or (5) the
                        student is denied admittance or re-admittance to the University. Full refund will
                        be made in the case of death. Fall residents wishing to petition for release from
                        their contract for the spring semester must do so in writing by November 1. No refunds
                        will be made for other than the above conditions.
                     
                     
                     Assigned applicants who fail to cancel by the deadline referred to in (1) above but
                        cancel before the close of the check-in period will forfeit 50% of their deposit.
                        Assigned residents who fail to cancel by the close of the check-in period will forfeit
                        their entire deposit. (This is applicable to both the Fall and Spring semesters.)
                     
                     
                     Refund of Residence Hall Rent: Refunds of residence hall rent after registration will be prorated on a weekly calendar
                        basis when the student is forced to withdraw from the residence halls: (1) because
                        of personal medical reasons confirmed in writing by a licensed physician, or (2) at
                        the request of the institution for other than disciplinary reasons. Full refund will
                        be made in the case of death.
                     
                     
                     For reasons other than those stated above, the following procedure shall apply: 75%
                        of fees will be refunded for withdrawal from the residence halls for a period of approximately
                        14 calendar days beginning with and inclusive of the first official day of classes
                        or within an equivalent period for a short-term course. Twenty-five percent (25%)
                        of fees will be refunded following expiration of the 75% period, for a period of time
                        extending approximately 25% of the time covered by the term. The periods during which
                        refunds of 75% or 25% will be made are exactly the same as the periods during which
                        the same refund percentages are made for maintenance fees. No refunds will be made
                        for other than the above conditions.
