                        would follow courses required for the AP Physics C exam; it would consist primarily
                        of experiments and problem solving which will be preceded with a quick overview of
                        the chapters.
                     
                     
                     The program would be led by a Faculty member at the department of physics and assisted
                        by a graduate teaching assistant.
                     
                     
                     Dates of classes for Fall 2015 are: September 12 - November 21
                     
                     Classes meet every Saturday in Manning Hall room 201 for 2 hours (9:30 am – 11:30 am).
                     
                     
                     There will be intense development in three critical areas:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        fundamental conceptual development,
                        
                        connection to real-world experiences through scientific inquiry and
                        
                        Critical thinking skills using mathematical applications and problem solving at the
                           single-variable calculus level.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     With the learning cycle to be used, students will encounter engagement, exploration,
                        explanation, extension, and evaluation. Animation and short videos will be used in
                        some instance in order to engage students in initial activities to introduce questions
                        before moving to exploration and explanation. This will also initiate discourse between
                        students where opportunities to address misconceptions will often surface.
                     
                     
                     The labs would predominantly be hands-on and will rely on more fundamental equipment
                        and graphs would be plotted by hand. Occasionally, a Pasco data collection and analysis
                        system would be used so students would be prepared for different techniques. Students
                        will work in small groups in order to promote group work in a variety of ways beginning
                        with experimental design and report writing. Students are expected to maintain two
                        folders, one for the overview and another for the lab activities.
