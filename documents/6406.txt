                        care; and caregiving in global perspective. Medical anthropologists favor a holistic
                        orientation, working to understand the dynamics of health and illness within the context
                        of larger social, ecological and political economic processes.
                     
                     
                     Faculty members in this concentration share a broad interest in applying anthropological
                        theory and methods to work toward health equity. Their specific teaching and research
                        foci include: racial, gender, and economic health inequalities; alcohol and drug abuse;
                        reproductive and maternal-child health; labor issues and occupational health; migration;
                        stress; mental health; human biology and adaptation; nutrition and food access; and
                        aging. Students in this concentration have completed practica with hospitals and clinics,
                        non-profit and grassroots agencies, and both governmental and non-governmental organizations.

                        to focus their practical exercises within their own areas of interest in their chosen
                        applied field. In addition to the common core courses, medical anthropology students
                        must also take these two concentration-specific courses:

                        collateral classes from related departments such as the School of Public Health . Students should construct a course of study in consultation with their faculty advisor.
                     
                     
                     All Masters candidates must complete a practicum. The practicum is designed to provide
                        hands-on experience in the student's area of interest. This allows the student to
                        gain practical experience and make contacts in a variety of organizations and agencies
                        and can lead to gainful employment. For a complete description of information on requirements,
