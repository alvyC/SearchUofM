                     UofM Students Provide Free Tax Prep Services for Low-Income Families
                     
                     June 6, 2016 - This spring, accounting and finance majors from the Fogelman College
                        of Business & Economics provided 337 hours of tax preparation services to residents
                        of the Binghampton area. While the residents benefitted from receiving the Earned
                        Income Tax Credit – often totaling more than $2,000 per family – the Fogelman students
                        gained an invaluable service learning opportunity by working in the neighboring community. 
                     
                     
                     To participate in the program, each student received a minimum of 12 hours of training
                        related to income tax preparation and was certified by the SaveFirst program. Graduate
                        accounting student James Miller helped coordinate the training and work schedule for
                        the students.
                     
                     
                     "By working with the SaveFirst program, our students received essential IRS training
                        which boosts their resumés, but more importantly, they learned the value of giving
                        back to our community," said Dr. Kathy Tuberville, faculty director of the Avron B.
                        Fogelman Professional Development Center. "Our Fogelman Serves program seeks to have
                        students invested in the community and gain credible leadership experience through
                        service learning. By working with these families, the students learned the value of
                        helping our city become stronger economically. It is our plan to increase the number
                        of students participating next spring and contribute more to the Binghampton community."
                     
                     
                     The students' efforts helped 837 low-income families secure more than $1.5 million
                        in tax refunds and saved them approximately $334,000 in commercial tax preparation
                        fees. In its second year, the program more than doubled the number of families served
                        over its first tax season.
                     
                     
                     The SaveFirst initiative ensures that low-income families receive the full Earned
                        Income Tax Credit (EITC) and other credits to which they are entitled and to encourage
                        long-term financial planning and asset building. With nearly half of EITC recipients
                        in the Memphis region paying a commercial preparer to complete their taxes, local
                        families lose more than $6.6 million each year to tax preparation costs. Free tax
                        preparation yields immediate economic relief when these individuals do not pay commercial
                        preparers for such services.
