The University of Memphis Workplace Violence Prevention POLICIES

Issued:  January 14, 2004 Responsible Official:  Vice President for Business & Finance Responsible Office:  Human Resources Policy Statement Policy Statement The University of Memphis is committed to making every effort to provide every employee an environment that is safe, secure, and free of threats and violence. In support of this policy, the University is intolerant of employees using threatening language or exhibiting behavior that is unsafe, threatening, or violent.
In accordance with federal and state laws, the University also prohibits the possession of any weapon by any individual on University premises, except law enforcement officers in performance of their duties.  This policy applies to all employees on properties and locations operated for and controlled by The University of Memphis.  One exception to this policy is the use of firearms and other weapons used for instructional or school-sanctioned ceremonial purposes.  Other exceptions can be found in the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) Guideline P-085 Workplace Violence Prevention  policy.
In addition to this policy, the provisions of TBR Guideline P-085 Workplace Violence Prevention  apply. Purpose   The purpose of this policy is to encourage all employees to report incidents of threats, aggression and other prohibited behaviors and acts of any individual(s) on University properties to their immediate supervisor, Police Services, and/or Human Resources.  This policy also establishes the basis for disciplinary actions if this policy or Tennessee Board of Regents Guideline P-085 Workplace Violence Prevention is violated.   Procedures Behaviors to Report It is impractical to set forth a comprehensive list of unruly behaviors and acts considered detrimental to a high quality work life, good business practices, and good employer-employee relations. However, some examples of such behavior include, but are not limited to (1) acts of physical bodily harm, (2) verbal threats or gestures that would suggest bodily harm and (3) written communication via e-mail and/or letters suggesting acts of threats and/or violence.
Also, TBR Guideline P-085 provides a comprehensive listing of definitions related to threats and violence as well as specifically prohibited activities.  Discipline Any unseemly behavior that threatens the life or wellbeing of others is not consistent with this policy and the University may take appropriate disciplinary action.
The employee responsible for any physical, verbal, written, or electronically transmitted conduct that is inconsistent with this policy will be subject to unpaid suspension, termination, prosecution, or other appropriate action under the law.
An employee who violates this policy by engaging in any of the prohibited activities specified in Section 6.0 of TBR Guideline P-085   is subject to discipline up to and including immediate dismissal. 
Refer also to Section 7.2 and 7.3 of the TBR Guideline as it relates specifically to weapons brought onto the work site. FAQs What about students?
