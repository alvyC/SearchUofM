                     Legal Thought and Liberal Arts Minor
                     
                     The minor in Legal Thought and Liberal Arts is designed to provide an interdisciplinary
                        liberal arts program for students in any major who intend to enter the legal profession.
                        The minor will be of particular benefit to pre-law students whose majors are more
                        professional in nature and who are not exposed to the broader liberal arts curriculum.
                        Students will be introduced to major intellectual traditions of the West and to ethical,
                        social, and economic issues of significance to our time. The courses in the minor
                        require that students read critically, think logically, and write clearly - attributes
                        required of persons in the legal profession. Students wishing to minor in Legal Thought
                        and Liberal Arts should contact the pre-professional advisor in room 107 Scates Hall.
