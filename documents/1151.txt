	   UofM Students: It's never too early to start learning how to be a good alum! Getting involved with the Alumni Association as a student is a great way to make connections and to begin supporting YOUR University.
Student Organizations
The UofM Alumni Association sponsors two student organization: Future Alumni of Memphis (aka FAM) and Student Ambassador Board. We're excited that the Lambuth Campus has formed a Student Ambassador Board also!

The FAM is our version of a "student alumni association." Membership is just $20 per year and you receive the same benefits as Association members (most importantly: discounts on textbooks, Tiger gear and food). 
The Student Ambassador Board (SAB) is an exclusive group of students that help host student, Alumni Association and Presidential events. The talented group of students act as a liaison between the administration,
alumni, current student body, prospective students and the Memphis community. SABs sponsor the messiest event on campus: Mudball. Proceeds fund the J. Wayne Johnson Scholarship, awarded to outstanding seniors each spring.
Scholarships
Many of the Alumni Association's clubs and chapters work hard all year to raise money to provide scholarships to deserving students. Be sure to apply for them! Complete the form through Tiger Scholarship Manager to apply.
