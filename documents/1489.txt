                     The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree is a program specifically designed for students whose
                        certain interests and abilities strongly suggest the potential for pursuing careers
                        as artists in the resident, professional, community, or academic theatre.
                     
                     
                     To expand the student's creative powers and deepen the commitment to a vocation in
                        the theatre, the B.F.A. program offers the student (1) a basic probing of all the
                        arts and crafts of the theatre and dance; (2) an exploration in depth of one area
                        of special interest; (3) the opportunity to participate creatively as a theatre or
                        dance artist through extensive production experience.
                     
                     
                     Three concentrations are offered: (1) Performance with an emphasis in Acting or Dance,
                        (2) Musical Theatre, and (3) Design and Technical Production. A Dance minor is offered.
                        Students entering the B.F.A. program will elect one of these three concentrations.
                        The University of Memphis is an accredited institutional member of the National Association
                        of Schools of Theatre.
                     
                     
                     Admission and Retention Criteria: Admission to the concentration in Performance with an emphasis in Acting or Musical
                        Theatre is by audition. Admission to the concentration in Design and Technical Production
                        is by interview.  Admission to the concentration in Performance with an emphasis in
                        dance is by application only. To remain in good standing as a major in Theatre and
                        Dance, the student must be evaluated through the evaluation and interview, or portfolio
                        and interview process. Following their examination and interview, or portfolio and
                        interview, applicants will be notified as to whether they have been accepted into
                        the program, accepted for one more semester on a probationary basis, or advised to
                        pursue another degree.
                     
                     
                     (1) Performance (with an emphasis in Acting): Retention in the Performance concentration
                        is based on a required annual examination and interview. In addition to the interview,
                        the student is expected to present an audition package consisting of two contrasting
                        monologues from plays of distinctly different styles or periods, and depending on
                        the student's preference, 16-32 bars of a song. The duration of material to be presented
                        willl vary based on the student's standing in the program and is at the discretion
                        of the faculty.
                     
                     
                     (2) Performance (with an emphsis in Dance): Retention is based on recommendation of
                        dance faculty.
                     
                     
                     (3) Musical Theatre: Retention in the Musical Theatre concentration is based on a
                        required annual examination and interview. In addition to the interview, the student
                        is expected to present an audition package consisting of monologues from plays, songs
                        from the musical theatre canon, and a demonstration of dance styles specific to the
                        genre. The duration of material to be presented will vary based on the student's standing
                        in the program and is at the discretion of the faculty.
                     
                     
                     (4) Design and Technical Production: Retention in the Design and Technical Production
                        concentration is based on an annual required portfolio review and interview. In addition
                        to the interview, the student is expected to present a portfolio of artistic and production
                        work. This may consist of items including photographs, sketches, costume plates, elevations,
                        lighting plots, ground plans, and audio designs.
                     
                     
                     The fact must be emphasized that admission to the B.F.A curriculum does not imply
                        a student's permanent tenure in the program. Beyond the audition interview or portfolio
                        review, the student's active participation in the co-curricular activities of the
                        department will be assessed by the theatre and dance faculty. Artistic growth, development
                        of technical facility, and continuing commitment to creative excellence on the part
                        of the student will be evaluated. Permission to continue in the program will be based
                        on this evaluation.
                     
                     
                     Former B.F.A. students who have left the program for a fall or spring term must apply
                        for readmission to the department. A new audition or interview may be required at
                        the discretion of the faculty. The readmission process is not required if the absence
                        is approved by the area coordinator and the department chair in advance.
                     
                     
                     Internship (THEA 4541): The intent of this requirement and course is to provide the
                        student experience in a full-time theatre production situation. Off-campus participation
                        (usually following the junior year) is an essential element of the B.F.A. program.
                        Details are to be planned in advance in conference with the student's advisor.
                     
                     
                     Transfer of Credit: In certain cases students may be admitted to an advanced level of the B.F.A. program.
                        Such admission will be based upon a departmental advisor's evaluation of previous
                        course work and theatre experience. Even if admitted to an advanced standing, the
                        student will be required to remedy previous course deficiencies.
                     
                     
                     Advising: Upon application to the B.F.A. program, each student will be assigned a faculty advisor.
