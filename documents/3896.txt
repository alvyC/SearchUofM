                     Frequently Asked Questions
                     Who can come to the CWC? If you are a UofM student, you can use the CWC.   Will my professor or instructor know that I visited the CWC?  You will be given the option of having an email sent to your professor or instructor
                     that confirms you visited the CWC.  Is there a cap on many times can I visit the CWC? There is no official limit or “cap” on how many times you can visit. In fact, we
                     encourage students to take full advantage of the CWC by requesting feedback on their
                     work throughout the process of its development. Depending on how busy the CWC gets
                     during midterm and finals week, we might limit sessions to 30 minutes and/or restrict
                     the number of appointments you can sign up for those periods.  What if I just want someone to proofread my papers? The CWC staff is happy to assist you at any stage of the process, even if all you
                     want is a reader to review a final draft. Please note, however, that we don’t mark
                     directly on your papers. Furthermore our sessions are interactive, which means we
                     won’t simply tell you what to “fix” in your drafts. With that said, what we will do
                     is offer feedback and help you develop editing strategies for proofreading your own
                     papers.  Do I have to have a draft of something in order to visit the CWC? No. We can help you brainstorm ideas and begin drafting an outline for whatever it
                     is you are starting to compose, whether it is a paper, a speech, or something else. I’m afraid of public speaking. Can the CWC help? Absolutely. We can help you develop strategies for delivering your speech, and we
                     also have a speaking studio where you can practice. Can I bring something I’m working on that’s not a school assignment? Yes. If you are writing a statement of purpose for a graduate school application,
                     developing a resume, writing a cover letter, drafting a letter to the editor, or working
                     on any other type of composition, our consultants will be happy to offer you feedback.
                     How can I become a CWC consultant?  If you are interested in becoming a CWC consultant, send an email to cwc@memphis.edu.  My question isn't here! Don't worry!
