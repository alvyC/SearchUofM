                        Grant of $3 million for cyber security training to the National Cybersecurity Preparedness
                        Consortium (NCPC).  The project will be led by the University of Arkansas Criminal
                        Justice Institute; the University of Memphis Center for Information Assurance (CfIA) will collaborate on the project as a core member of the consortium.
                     
                     
                     This Homeland Security National Training Program (HSNTP) will provide FEMA-certified
                        training to first responders, emergency managers, technical specialists, and local
                        government and community leaders, preparing them for all types of cyber emergencies.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis is at the forefront of information security research, education,
                        and outreach in the region, according to Dr. Dipankar Dasgupta, founding director
                        of CfIA, which is a National Center for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance.
                        "The center will receive $474,000 from the consortium, and though this grant we will
                        be developing an online training course on mobile device security and privacy issues.
                        The course will make it safer for everyone browsing the Internet," he said.
                     
                     
                     The 36-month program focuses on four areas: cyber security, hazardous materials, countering
                        violent extremism and rural preparedness. Rural preparedness includes school-based
                        incidents, mass fatality planning and response, the development of emergency operation
                        plans, rail car safety, media engagement strategies for first responders, agro-terrorism,
                        food and animal safety, and hazardous materials.
