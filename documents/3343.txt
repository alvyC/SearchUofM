                     Potential Members
                     
                     Thank you for your interest in joining our University of Memphis fraternity/sorority
                           community!
                     
                     Here are a few reasons why joining a fraternity or sorority may be right for you:
                     
                     INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT
                     
                     The Memphis fraternity/sorority community is built on strong academic standards. Members
                           expect a lot of themselves and each other. Chapters provide a number of resources
                           to support members in their academics:
                     
                     
                        
                        Group study sessions
                        
                        Workshops on study skills, test-taking strategies, time management, stress relief,
                              and resume building
                        
                        Faculty advisers offer support and expertise
                        
                        Academic standards and member improvement plans should a member fall below the chapter
                              GPA requirement
                        
                     
                     
                     LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
                     
                     As a member of a fraternity or sorority you'll find tremendous opportunities to become
                           an effective leader. Greek organizations are self-governing with numerous leadership
                           opportunities. Membership offers leadership training programs campus-wide and within
                           chapters. Our members have the opportunity to:
                     
                     
                        
                        Hold a leadership role within their chapter
                        
                        Participate in our Panhellenic, Interfraternity, or National Pan-Hellenic Council
                        
                        Serve on University-wide committees
                        
                        Participate in local, state, regional, and national conferences
                        
                     
                     
                     Civic Engagement
                     
                     Service to others and the community is a part of everyday life in the fraternity/sorority
                           community. Our members are generous fundraisers and service providers, annually giving
                           more than $240,000 and providing over 7,000 hours of service. Our chapters:
                     
                     
                        
                        Organize, volunteer, and host different community service and philanthropic initiatives
                              each year
                        
                        Organize dozens of chapter events to raise money and educate the campus
                        
                        Host and support other student organizations' educational programming about issues
                              of civic engagement
                        
                     
                     
                     BROTHERHOOD/SISTERHOOD
                     
                     The friendship of fraternity and sorority life is a true family experience. It offers
                           you the security and happiness that is part of the brother/sister bond. While you
                           don't have to limit your social life to fraternity and sorority activities, you will
                           find many opportunities to meet and interact with your chapter, other chapters, and
                           other campus organizations. Membership in a fraternity/sorority is not limited to
                           your time as a student at Memphis; following graduation, there are still a number
                           of ways to stay connected and remain active as a lifetime member of your organization.
