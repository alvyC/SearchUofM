                     Project Planning Timelines
                     
                     Advance planning is crucial to having your deliverable ready when needed. Based on
                        our experience, the average minimum lengths of time needed to complete various projects
                        from the day we receive your final and approved content (copy and images) are outlined
                        below. Our definition of "approved" is when final written copy and image selection
                        has been agreed upon and indicated by the signature of the department head or project
                        head on the proofed copy, and the piece will not undergo any subsequent changes. Substantial
                        changes to written copy made after final approval will significantly slow down production
                        turnaround times. If you have to make changes, it will delay the production. Bottom
