                        About Dr. Cole
                        
                        Dr. Cole joined the Department in 2003. She teaches BIOL 4480/6480 Cellular and Molecular
                           Pharmacology. BIOL7140/8140 Receptors and Signaling, and BIOL7000/8000 Introduction
                           to Graduate Studies. She began her research career as a comparative endocrinologist,
                           studying the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis in European starlings.
                           In her post-doctoral work, she became interested in the regulation of parathyroid
                           hormone (PTH) receptors and PTH-activated signaling pathways in kidney and bone. At
                           the University of Memphis, Dr. Cole has continued her work on PTH signaling and has
                           also collaborated with colleagues studying the regulation of cell signaling at host-parasite
                           interfaces as well as the role of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and its
                           ligands in regulating epithelial cell function. Dr. Cole is a member of the American
                           Society for Bone and Mineral Research, American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental
                           Therapeutics, and the American Society for Cell Biology.
