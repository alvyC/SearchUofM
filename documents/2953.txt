                        IOS app or the Android app from Google Play, and also review session history as a
                        study guide outside of class. With REEF multiple choice, numeric and show answer questions

                     Can any i>clicker student remote (ic, ic+, and ic2) be used with a REEF account?
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           
                           Yes, REEF supports all models of i>clicker remotes. Students can purchase a I>Clicker
                              remote online.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Do students using a clicker need to buy a REEF Polling subscription?
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           
                           No, students exclusively using an i>clicker remote to vote will not need to purchase
                              a subscription to participate in polls. However, students need to create a REEF Polling
                              account, add their clicker ID to their profile, and join the course in order for the
                              instructor to identify their clicker votes.
