                     As of fall, 2013, any student who has not completed both SWRK 2010 and SWRK 2911 (with
                        a grade of at least a C-) is considered a Pre-Social Work (PSWK) major. Professor
                        Brandon Ousley advises all PSWK majors.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Professor Brandon Ousely also advises all students who are thinking of changing their
                           major to Social Work or who are interested in transferring to the University of Memphis
                           from another institution of higher learning.
                        
                        
                        Only students who have completed both SWRK 2010 and SWRK 2911 are recognized as Social
                           Work (SWRK) majors.
                        
                        
                        Permits are required to enroll in all SWRK classes.
