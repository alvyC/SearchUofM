		ITS Strategic Planning

		
			Posted by  Bambi Lange		
	

	
		Each spring, Information Technology Systems (ITS) collects feedback from students, staff and faculty using the Techqual survey. This year that feedback will be supplemented by a review of our organizational effectiveness, and the results from both efforts will support this year’s strategic planning effort. Ben Bryant has agreed to assist with our review of organizational effectiveness.
 
Mr. Bryant, a founder of SCB Computer Technology in 1976, has over 40 years of experience in the IT industry and has a long history of supporting the University. He holds BBA and MS degrees from the UofM and has served on the UofM Board of Visitors since 1997. He was appointed Executive in Residence at the FedEx Institute of Technology in 2010 and continues to serve the University as Executive in Residence at the Crews Center for Entrepreneurship.
 
As part of this engagement, Mr. Bryant will confer with individuals throughout ITS and the University. We anticipate the review will be completed by June, 2016 and recommendations will be reviewed to identify opportunities that can be leveraged to increase operational efficiencies and effectiveness within ITS. Mr. Bryant can be reached at 901.678.1597.
 
Meetings with Ben Bryant will be coordinated as needed during the coming weeks. Please contact me with any questions about this process.
Regards,
Robert
