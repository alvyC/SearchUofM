                     Chemistry of Materials--CHEM 1010
                     
                     This course and the associated laboratory, CHEM 1011 , together (4 credit hours) satisfy a General Education Natural Science requirement
                        for students majoring in social sciences, humanities, fine arts, business, and education.
                        CHEM 1010 and 1011 are required for B. S. Engineering Technology majors. This course
                        will not be credited toward a major in any of the physical sciences, biological sciences,
                        mathematics, or engineering.
                     
                     
                     Students whose program of study requires them to take CHEM 1110, General Chemistry
                        1 (science majors and those preparing for health professional schools), but who lack
                        adequate background may take this course, CHEM 1010, as preparation, and must take
                        MATH 1710 concurrently if it or a higher MATH course has not already been completed.
                     
                     
                     Prerequisite: MATH 1420 or MATH 1710 with minimum grade of C-, or a score on the ALEKS math placement
                        exam appropriate for placement in MATH 1710. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll concurrently in the associated laboratory,
                        CHEM 1011 .
