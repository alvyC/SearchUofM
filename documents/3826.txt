			Dear Colleagues:
Consistent with our commitment to greater efficiency and effectiveness on campus, the President’s Office and the Office of the Provost are implementing budget reductions that will total approximately $1.3 million.  In my office we are making several changes, including eliminating two vice-provosts positions and recommending the movement of the vice-provost for research to an autonomous division, reporting directly to the president.  This will elevate the role of research on campus, particularly efforts to grow interdisciplinary collaborations, along with providing research consistent access and input at the highest level.  In short, this change demonstrates a serious and strategic commitment to reaching our goal of $100 million in research expenditures.  The two vice-provost positions being eliminated include the vice-provost for extended programs and the vice-provost for undergraduate programs.  Elements of extended programs will be folded into the Division for Academic Planning, Assessment and Innovation, with the integration offering greater efficiency and effectiveness.  With the rapid pace of change in curriculum delivery and our seamless use of technology on campus, the idea of “extended” programs is no longer accurate or meaningful.  Regardless of where or how students engage with the University of Memphis, they are Memphis Tigers. 
Dr. Lattimore will be returning full-time as dean of University College.   He has done a remarkable job of growing our online delivery, with penetration in every college on campus and almost every program.  He has also directed our Lambuth campus over the last several years, not only establishing a solid foundation but spearheading strong and consistent growth.  The search for a permanent dean for the Lambuth campus will wrap up this spring, with a targeted start date of mid-July.  The Innovation unit, under the leadership of Dr. Dick Irwin, will assume responsibility for a number of select programs including internships and experiential learning, among others. Dr. Irwin has been leading many of these units for some time now.  Elements of the undergraduate programs division are also being folded into the Division of Academic Planning, Assessment and Innovation.  Most important, though, our advising units will be integrated into a consolidated Student Success Center, along with comparable programs from Student Affairs.  This will allow us not only greater efficiency, but improved effectiveness as a result of better coordination across Academic Affairs and Student Affairs.  As a result of these changes, Academic Affairs will have three primary divisions including Enrollment Services, Information Technology Services, and Academic Planning, Assessment and Innovation. In recognition of its remarkable growth over the last few years, the Helen Hardin Honors Program will report directly to the provost and the director will join the deans’ council. Dr. Blanton will be returning to the faculty in the Department of Political Science.  She has played a critical role in the growth of the Honors Program, along with exceptional work in the Center for Academic Retention and Enrichment Services.  All of the changes summarized will become effective with the start of the new fiscal year, July 1, 2014. 
 These reductions demonstrate a commitment to efficiency and effectiveness at all levels at the University of Memphis, particularly the highest levels of administration.  The effort has revolved around a firm commitment to eliminating duplication and improving efficiency across the divisional structure in the provost’s office, recognizing that the bulk of infrastructure and support is needed at the college level, with those in direct and daily contact with our students.  
 Go Tigers!
M. David Rudd, Provost

						Faculty Workload Policies

			Dear Colleagues,
The Faculty Senate executive committee requested clarification of our current and future teaching load policies.  As part of our overall budget and efficiency review process, I recently requested that all deans clarify their workload policies. In some cases, workload policies had to be developed.  In general, there has been a lack of clarity and uniformity across colleges regarding existing TBR policy and translation at the University of Memphis.
Before clarifying existing policies, let me first reinforce our unwavering commitment to growing our research mission and our goal of $100 million in research expenditures. We have protected our research enterprise from any budget reductions, recently completed a research capacity analysis, and just a few days ago a broad-based group of faculty (in coordination with the Faculty Senate research committee) provided an implementation plan to help guide expansion of our research infrastructure.   We are serious about growing our research mission.  Greater clarity and consistency in teaching loads at the college and department levels are essential to that effort. 
It is also worth noting that, arguably, the greatest opportunities for expansion and success on the research front are embedded in interdisciplinary collaboration.  We need to be creative and innovative about how best to generate and sustain interdisciplinary work.  The Institute for Intelligent Systems is a wonderful example at the U of M.  The pace and breadth of their success has been nothing short of remarkable.  Some of our reconfiguration efforts on the health side will provide unique and fruitful opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, creativity, and innovation.  I’ve requested that vice-provost for research, Dr. Andy Meyers, develop an interdisciplinary initiative, one that will make funding available to support targeted interdisciplinary projects.  There should be no doubt we are serious about growing our research enterprise, and we are taking definitive and concrete steps to demonstrate that commitment.
Naturally, clarity of faculty workload is an essential for productive research universities. I have not asked for any increase in faculty teaching loads. What I have requested is that all colleges have clearly articulated workload policies (consistent with TBR policies), that we follow existing policies in a consistent manner, and that we have accountability built into the system.  As you all know, TBR policy defines a full faculty load as 15 credit hours of undergraduate teaching per semester, or the equivalent, or 12 credit hours of graduate teaching per semester, or the equivalent. 
Teaching loads at the U of M vary across colleges and departments, with equivalency credit for other activities– research/creative activity/scholarship being most prominent.  Other activities have also resulted in reductions, including advising, administration, institutional/public service or other professional service associated with the profession. Deans have developed, or are in the process of developing, policies to guide workloads across departments and programs. There has been no request for uniform increases in teaching loads. We will continue to provide reductions for appropriate reasons, particularly active and productive research/creative activity/scholarship, while taking into account the particulars of various academic areas.
 Go Tigers!
 M. David Rudd, Provost
