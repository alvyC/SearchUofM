                     The major goals of the project are to better understand neural basis of complex auditory
                        perception and how it is changed with experience and training. Event-related brain
                        potentials (ERPs) are used to record the electrical activity of the human nervous
                        system and relate brain responses to perceptual and cognitive abilities. We are currently
                        investigating how an individual's perceptual and cognitive abilities for speech and
                        music manifest from their underlying brain activity. We are also examining how listening
                        expertise and/or training (e.g., music lessons, bilingualism) influence an individual's
                        auditory skills and how these benefits might transfer to improve seemingly unrelated
                        cognitive abilities including memory and attention.
