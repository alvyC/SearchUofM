                        Students in the Loewenberg College of Nursing graduate program must comply with all
                           retention standards of the University of Memphis Graduate School.
                        
                        
                        Students must earn a grade of "B" or better in all clinical and lab courses (NURS
                           7102; 7602; 7604; 7606; 7609; 7207; 7209; 7307; 7309; 7909) in order to graduate.
                        
                        
                        Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 GPA ("B"). Grades of "D" and "F" will not apply
                           toward any graduate degree, but will be computed in the GPA. No more than 7 hours
                           of "C-", "C," or "C+" will be applied towards meeting degree requirements.
                        
                        
                        The grade "I" (Incomplete) may be assigned by the faculty member in any course in
                           which the student is unable to complete the work due to extraordinary events beyond
                           the individual's control that are acceptable to the faculty member. The "I" may not
                           be used to extend the term for students who complete the course with an unsatisfactory
                           grade. Unless the student completes the requirements for removal of the "I" within
                           90 days from the end of the semester or summer session in which it was received (see
                           University Calendar), the "I" will change to an "F," whether or not the student is
                           enrolled. The faculty member may grant up to a 45-day extension if sufficient extenuating
                           circumstances exist. At the end of the extension period, the "I" grade will automatically
                           revert to "F" if the student has not completed the requirements. The student will
                           be certified for graduation only when all requirements are met, including the removal
                           of "I" grades. If a student has an "I" in a course necessary to fulfill degree requirements
                           in the semester in which he or she expects to graduate, the certification process
                           and graduation will automatically be deferred to the next term.Â 
                        
                        
                        Academic disqualification from the graduate nursing major will occur when the student:
                           
                              
                              fails to maintain a 3.0 GPA in graduate school.
                              
                              fails to earn a grade of "B" (3.0) or better when repeating a course.
