                     Overview
                     
                     Consideration of curricular requests at the University level ordinarily takes place
                        once a year so that the requests may be reviewed in relation to each other and from
                        the perspective of University programs as a whole. The procedures, formats, and summaries
                        direct attention to the details and consistency that are necessary for such planning.
                        The Curricular Procedures Handbook does not address the philosophy of curriculum but
                        the process employed to gain approval of the curriculum.
                     
                     
                     Consultation with Academic Affairs staff early in the planning process for new programs
                        will expedite that process:
