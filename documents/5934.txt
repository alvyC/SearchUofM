                     The Department recognizes the value of on-the-job experience to the educational development
                        of students. We strongly encourage majors to pursue internship experiences as part
                        of their academic program.
                     
                     
                     Students can receive academic credit for a qualifying internship. A student participating
                        in an internship who wishes to receive academic credit must register for COMP 4911/6911.
                        A qualifying internship satisfies 3 elective credits in the computer science major;
                        however, a student may apply an internship to an elective credit only once.
                     
                     
                     If you are interested in seeking an internship position, please thoroughly familiarize
                        yourself with the procedures on this page before contacting your academic advisor.
                        The Department's internship coordinator is currently Dr. William Baggett .
                     
                     
                     Advice for Seeking Internships
                     
                     Most computer science internships are paid. If it works with your schedule and career
                        goals, seek out a full-time summer internship at a technology company in a place like
                        the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, Boston, or Seattle. Big software companies generally
                        have active, ongoing internship programs, and completing an internship at one of these
                        places can give you a taste of what it's like to be a full-time employee.
                     
                     
                     Before you apply for an internship, get your online and professional presence in order.
                        This includes:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Create or update your LinkedIn profile. Connect with at least a few people you have
                           a professional connection with.
                        
                        
                        Update your resume, and make sure it's publicly accessible.
                        
                        Put your contact details in your email signature. You don't need to include your signature
                           in every email, but have them ready so you can quickly pop in a signature in professional
                           correspondence.
                        
                        
                        Clean up your Facebook/Instagram pics, if necessary. A couple of indiscreet pictures
                           is usually not a problem, but get rid of anything that's overtly unethical or illegal.
