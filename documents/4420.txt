                     Participation in the Academic Common Market allows qualified students from southern
                        states to pay in-state tuition while pursuing certain degree programs at The University
                        of Memphis. This arrangement is available only for students whose home states do not
                        offer the designated program. The state in which the student resides determines which
                        of the programs offered by The University of Memphis it will make available to its
                        students.
                     
                     
                     The Academic Common Market is sponsored by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB).
                        Participating states are Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
                        Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee,
                        Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia (Florida and Texas grant access for graduate level
                        programs only). Current SREB common market guidelines and requirements may be found
                        on the web at www.sreb.org/programs/acm/acmindex.asp.
                     
                     
                     Students may request through their home state coordinators that additional programs
                        be made accessible. A list of the state coordinators with their addresses and telephone
                        numbers may be obtained from the Office of Curriculum Planning or from the Academic
                        Common Market web site at www.sreb.org/programs/acm/acmindex.asp.
                     
                     
                     In addition to certification requirements that the student's state of residence may
                        specify, the following pertain: (1) students must be fully admitted to a degree program
                        that has been approved as an Academic Common Market program (non-degree students are
                        ineligible); (2) students must obtain a letter certifying residency, term of entry,
                        and approval for the particular University of Memphis program from their state's Academic
                        Common Market coordinator.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: After enrollment, students remain eligible for in-state tuition only so long as they
                        are continuously enrolled—consecutive fall and spring terms—in the same major for
                        which they were originally certified. If students change major, they must process
                        a Change of Major through their advisor and notify the Office of Admissions to change
                        the Academic Common Market residency code on their records. Failure to process the Change of Major and to notify the Office of Admissions may
                           subject the student to out-of-state fees for all subsequent terms of enrollment in
                           classes for a major other than the one for which the student received ACM certification. Missing a fall or spring term of enrollment or a change of major requires that the
                        student be recertified through the ACM coordinator in the student's state of residence.
