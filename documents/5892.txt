                     Academic advising is a critical component of the undergraduate experience. It is the
                        process of developing a meaningful educational plan that is compatible with the student's
                        abilities, values, interests and career goals. In achieving an academic degree, both
                        the student and the advisor must share in the responsibilities. It is University of
                        Memphis policy that every student be advised before each registration period unless
                        a student qualifies to be cleared for more than one semester by their advisor.
