                     Master of Science in Business Administration Concentration in Finance
                     
                     The Master of Science in Business Administration program with a concentration in Finance
                        is a 33-hour program that usually can be completed within 2 years. The program offers
                        the most in depth exploration of Finance and related topics of any of the Master's
                        programs offered at the University of Memphis. Prominent features of the program are
                        the wide range of Finance electives, evening classes that are convenient to students
                        working in the Memphis area, and small class sizes.
                     
                     
                     Overview of the M.S. Program
                     
                     The Master of Science (MS) programs give students more emphasis in the specialty area
                        than traditional MBA programs. The Fogelman College offers the M.S.B.A. degree with
                        concentration in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Finance.
                     
                     
                     The MSBA program in Finance assumes a prequalification in Calculus. Students entering
                        with a bachelor's degree in Business or Engineering are usually able to enter the
                        program without further study.
                     
                     
                     The MSBA program in Finance consists of 6 hours from the Business Administration core,
                        12 hours from the FIR (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) core, and 15 hours of
                        elective courses. Under normal circumstances, a student would take 21-27 of the 33
                        hours from the FIR (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) area.
                     
                     
                     Applying to the M.S.B.A. Program in Finance
                     
                     Prospective students applying to the Finance program should submit an online application
                        and pay the relevant application fee ($35 for domestic students and $60 for international
                        students). They should also send transcripts of the undergraduate work and test scores
                        on either the GRE or GMAT to the Graduate Admissions Office. Candidates may get more
                        information about taking the GRE on campus by going to www.memphis.edu/testing. Once
                        applications are complete, the Graduate Admissions Office forwards them to the Graduate
                        Programs Office and the FIR department for review. For US students, the Fall application
                        deadline is July 1. The Spring application deadline is December 1.
                     
                     
                     Well-qualified undergraduate students who are in their final year of the BBA program
                        in the Fogelman College may benefit from the Accelerated BBA/MSBA Finance program.
                        Interested students must make an appointment with the MSBA Finance program coordinator
                        prior to registering for their final semester of undergraduate work. These students
                        must hold an undergraduate GPA of 3.25 or above. Once accepted in the accelerated
                        program, students may register for up to 9 hours of graduate courses that may count
                        for both undergraduate and graduate credit. As a result, students would be able to
                        earn the MSBA Finance degree with only 24 hours beyond the BBA degree. Another benefit
                        of the accelerated program is that prospective graduate students can avoid the GRE/GMAT
                        requirement.
                     
                     
                     The college requires an evaluation of transcripts by WES for students who are applying
                        for a graduate degree program in the Fogelman College who earned their last degree
                        at a university outside of the USA.

                     Internships
                     
                     Students in the MSBA program may obtain up to 3 hours of academic credit for finance-related
                        internships. In order to get 3 hours of credit for FIR 4911, they must work a minimum
                        of 150 hours in the internship and work with a faculty member to show evidence of
                        their accomplishments in the internship. A major advantage of studying in the Memphis
                        area is the wide variety of employers who are able to offer work and internship opportunities
                        for students.
                     
                     
                     The Professional Development Center (PDC) located in the Fogelman College offers a
                        wide variety of support services to students who need assistance finding internships
                        and career opportunities in the areas of finance and business. Students turn to the
                        PDC for help in improving their resumes, strategies to enhance their interviewing
                        and networking skills, and seminars to learn how to be successful in the corporate
                        world. Finance students benefit from the professional development series Futures in
                        Finance aimed specifically at students seeking a career in Finance.
                     
                     
                     Experiential Learning
                     
                     MSBA students seeking further practical learning in the investments area may benefit
                        from participating in the CFA Institute Research Challenge and the TVA Investment
                        Challenge. In the CFA Institute Research Challenge, selected students compete against
                        students from other universities to show evidence of superior ability in analyzing
                        a single company. In the TVA Investment Challenge, students invest actual money held
                        by the Tennessee Valley Authority with the goal of earning a higher return than teams
                        from other regional universities.
                     
                     
                     In both competitions, University of Memphis students have at their disposal the resources
                        of the Cook Analytics and Trading Lab, which is located on the ground floor of the
                        Fogelman Classroom Building. This new facility greatly enhances students' abilities
                        to conduct financial research and to acquire cutting-edge research skills that employers
                        seek.
