                        mesenchymal cells. This epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key biological
                        process during normal development that is reactivated in several pathologies including
                        organ fibrosis and cancer metastasis. One goal of this research is to identify novel
                        master regulators of EMT and the reverse process MET. This information will be used
                        in designing new strategies for regenerative medicine and the treatment of EMT related
                        pathologies. Projects in the lab use molecular, cellular and embryological tools to
                        identify regulators of EMT. Student projects are dependent on previous knowledge and
                        experience, and include tissue culture of genetically altered stem cells, isolation
                        of RNA, preparation of cDNA, measurement of gene expression changes, isolation and
                        separation of protein, and measurement of protein levels and activity.
