                     The Executive Branch of the Student Government Association is led by the President
                        and Vice President. They have a small cabinet of advisors that keep them informed
                        about all aspects of campus life. The Executive Branch is responsible for faithfully
                        executing all laws set forth by the Legislative Branch, insuring that they are properly
                        addressed by the appropriate administrators at the University of Memphis. The Executive
                        Branch also advises the Freshman Senate.
