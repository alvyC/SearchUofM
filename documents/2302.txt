                     Program Overview

                        in the State of Tennessee (LPC-MHSP). Students are eligible to take the national Certified
                        Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC) exam during the last semester of their course work.

                     The Profession of Rehabilitation Counseling
                     
                     Rehabilitation counselors utilize their skills and knowledge assist individuals with
