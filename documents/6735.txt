                     Venkatesh Mandapati, E-Commerce Intern, AutoZone, Inc. Candidate, MS in Business Administration, Class of 2016
                     
                     "The Complete Professional Program (CPP) has had a profound impact on my career. As
                        an International student, I found myself at a crossroads, uncertain what to do next,
                        but the Avron B. Fogelman Professional Development Center gave me guidance and provided
                        me with the tools I needed to succeed. I apply the skills I've learned every single
                        day."
                     
                     
                      
                     
                     Jessica Haste Inventory Accounting Intern, AutoZone, Inc. Candidate, BBA in Accountancy, Class of 2017
                     
                     "I was encouraged by my professor, Dr. Kenton Walker, to participate in Accounting
                        Careers of Tomorrow (ACT), one of the training programs offered through the Fogelman
                        Professional Development Center. Once I completed the program, I knew I wanted to
                        continue taking advantage of the fantastic resources available through the Center.
                        My mock interview with Carolyn Cates was invaluable to me in successfully interviewing
                        with AutoZone and landing an internship in their Inventory Accounting Department.
                        I am very appreciative of the PDC. It is a unique and valuable resource all Fogelman
                        students should take advantage of!"

                     "The knowledge I gained through the PDC workshops and career coaching was invaluable,
                        especially my mock interview with Mrs. Cates. She gave me confidence in my ability
                        to answer questions. I remember smiling during my interview in New York when they
                        asked one of the typical "working in a group" questions because, as a result of my
                        mock interview, I had 4 or 5 examples to pick from immediately! Thank you, Mrs. Cates,
                        for being straightforward with me while, at the same time, reminding me how valuable
                        I could be to any organization. I will continue to make you, the PDC, and the U of
                        M proud."
