                     The FRG Review Groups will use the following criteria in their evaluation of the nominations.
                        This set of criteria is deliberately broad, as it must encompass a wide spectrum of
                        potential candidates. All work to be evaluated must have been accomplished while the
                        nominee was in full-time employment at The University of Memphis. (Note that this
                        normally excludes publications resulting directly from the candidate's dissertation,
                        unless a part of the dissertation was completed while employed as a faculty member
                        at the University.) Evidence of continued effort and professional development is of
                        particular importance.

                     Nomination Statement
                     Â Â Include a statement on the cover sheet (copy attached) placing the nominee's work
                     within the field and in the larger scheme of things. This statement can be written
                     by the nominee, by the person making the nomination, or by a prominent member of the
                     field. If the statement is solicited by the nominee, it should be clearly presented
                     as such. The nominee should also supply the names of five possible referees, to be
                     called upon if necessary.
                     
                     Publications and Presentations
                     Â Â The publications may be co-authored; however, it is desirable to distinguish senior
                     and junior authorship. Cite all authors in the order in which they appear in the publication;
                     star the names of student authors. Indicate the five most important scholarly works.
                     Editorships and reviews are excluded as these are taken into consideration under professional
                     recognition. Emphasis should be placed on publications that have been peer-reviewed
                     in national or international journals that are widely disseminated within their field.
                     In those fields where it is possible, evidence and impact in the field (such as recognition
                     as one of the most cited papers) is also important.
