                     CERI - a geophysics research center with active projects in different parts of the
                        world, several centering on causes and consequences of earthquakes in the New Madrid
                        seismic zone (located in proximity to Memphis), and monitored by our seismic and GPS
                        networks. Our research interests cover the spectrum of seismology and geodesy. And
                        our interaction with affiliated academic departments enhances and facilitates our
                        research in tectonics and engineering seismology.
                     
                     
                     Seismology
                     
                     Aided by excellent computational facilities and exploration software, the broad spectrum
                        of seismology is researched. Study covers aspects of applied, observational, and theoretical
                        seismology.

                     Active, present-day deformations, as well as long-term behaviors of the Earth's crust
                        and lithosphere are studied using numerical simulations constrained by geological,
                        seismological and geodetic observations.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Mechanics and Physics of Earthquakes
                     
                     Advanced numerical models are being used to study problems at the intersection of
                        physics, geophysics, seismology, and materials science.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Geodesy
                     
                     Traditional and high-rate GPS geodetic data and seismology is used to measure motions
                        associated with earthquakes, intra- and inter-plate deformations in the earthquake
                        cycle, and its integration into orogeny, postseismic deformation, plate tectonics,
                        and crustal/isostatic responses to variations in crustal loading.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Engineering Seismology
                     
                     Investigating ground motions in large earthquakes and their effects on the built environment
                        through an integrated approach using knowledge from seismology and civil engineering.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Exploration Seismology
                     
                     Active/passive source studies range from investigation of near-surface geological
                        features to large-scale, continental lithosphere structure.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     Computational Seismology
                     Large-scale computational facilities are aiding the integration of modeling approaches
                     in geodynamics, earthquake physics and ground motion simulation. Investigating faulting
                     phenomena at multi-scale lengths is a unifying theme.
