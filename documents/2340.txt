                           of technology to foster an unrivaled program in urban ecological research for meeting
                           the current and future needs in conservation and management of natural resources in
                           the metropolitan community of Memphis and around the world.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Training
                     
                     Development of an interdisciplinary graduate program focused on ecology and management
                        of natural resources (e.g., wildlife, fisheries, forestry, conservation, and other)
                        with a focus on urban and suburban communities. 
                     
                     
                     The program would epitomize the highest realization of graduate-level education aimed
                        at resolving and preventing ecological and social problems of the 21st century.
                     
                     
                     Students would uphold traditional backgrounds in ecology but cross traditional boundaries
                        resulting in a multidisciplinary focus that would combine ecological studies with
                        such fields as public policy, economics, political science, sociology, communications,
                        geography, and technology...
                     
                     
                     Emphasis would be placed on technology and the use of technology to enhance research,
                        teaching, and service as it applies to natural resources. Students graduating from
                        the program would have technological skills that would equip them for conducting research
                        at the highest level.
                     
                     
                     Because of the complexity of the issues and situations associated with urban ecology,
                        there is a strong need for bright, energetic, and imaginative students who feel they
                        can make a difference in our struggle for a sustainable high quality of life on earth.
                     
                     
                     The field of Urban Ecology is still developing and needs many bright minds to determine
                        its future directions. This situation offers students many new and exciting opportunities
                        related to careers in this new frontier of the 21st century.
                     
                     
                     Research
                     
                     A new research approach toward understanding the complex interactions among humans
                        and their environment is needed. While many natural habitats continue to decrease
                        in extent, urban habitat continues to increase at a rapid pace. Paralleling the growth
                        in urban habitat is an increase in extinction rates of plants and animals and a global
                        loss of biodiversity (the entire array of earth's biological variety, contained in
                        genes, populations, communities, and ecosystems). This situation has been described
                        as a crisis state.
                     
                     
                     Managers of natural resources, with environmental economists, must offer a careful
                        and well-designed integration of conservation and management plans to transform ecological
                        knowledge into public policy if extinction rates are to be lowered and biodiversity
                        preserved. The challenge is to simultaneously serve the needs of humans and, yet,
                        preserve nature. New practices, policies, and bright minds are needed to meet this
                        challenge.
                     
                     
                     The research goal is to investigate, synthesize results, and recommend policy changes
                        that will be instrumental in restoring and maintaining the natural processes that
                        create and protect a healthy, unfragmented landscape to support a diverse, flourishing
                        community of human, plant, and animal life.
                     
                     
                     Because of the multiple interests associated with natural resources in urban locations,
                        a strong and growing need exists for understanding ecological systems in these areas
                        and providing information that can be used in decision-making.
                     
                     
                     Conservation of natural ecosystems and preservation of biological processes is of
                        paramount interest. This goal is best achieved through proactive research rather than
                        reactive activities. Humans are and will continue to be a part of natural and degraded
                        ecological systems, and, therefore, their presence must be considered in ecologically
                        sustainable management of natural resources.
                     
                     
                     Scientific information strong on policy-relevant questions and a work force of researchers
                        trained with a robust cross-disciplinary approach critical to success in urban environments
                        will result from such focused research.
                     
                     
                     Institutionalizing Ecological Literacy is critical to our future. Environments are both urban and rural. Students and researchers
                        should be knowledgeable of the ever-widening ecosystem concerns, beginning in neighborhoods
                        and expanding the globe. The proposed Urban Ecology Initiative promises to foster
                        this aim.
