                     So many areas of the globe are prone to earthquakes. As citizens of the world, we
                        worry about the devastating effects they can have on society. CERI plays a huge role
                        in providing both scientific and practical information about earthquakes and earthquake
                        preparedness to people in the central and eastern U.S. who could someday be affected
                        by a significant earthquake.
                     
                     
                     During the Iben Browning episode of 1990, CERI was the main regional source of earthquake
                        information. Filling the information vacuum during the period of intense public concern
                        had a permanent impact on public awareness and understanding of regional earthquake
                        hazards.
                     
                     
                     Town Hall meetings are conducted by staff and faculty members on an on-going basis
                        to address specific concerns of citizens related to earthquake hazards.
