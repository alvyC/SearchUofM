                        Dr. Fleming joined the Computer Science Department in Fall 2011. Prior to joining,
                           he earned his doctorate in Computer Science from Michigan State University and worked
                           as a postdoc at Oregon State University.
                        
                        
                        As a researcher, Dr. Fleming works in the area of software engineering with an emphasis
                           on human aspects. For instance, software developers are regularly faced with myriad
                           information-intensive tasks, and Dr. Fleming has worked to deepen our understanding
                           of how developers seek information during such tasks. To date, this research has yielded
                           both executable models of developers' navigation behavior as well as designs for tools
                           that better support developers' information needs during development tasks. Dr. Fleming's
                           human-oriented software engineering research has also investigated issues in end-user
                           software engineering, gender in software engineering, and concurrent software development.
                        
                        
                        At the University of Memphis, Dr. Fleming teaches undergraduate- and graduate-level
                           software engineering courses, including the undergraduate capstone project course.
                           His courses cover the foundational principles, processes, and methods of software
                           engineering while providing students with practical experience in the collaborative
                           development of high-quality software.
