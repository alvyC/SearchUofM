                           Ensure your address will be an address that will be valid 2-3 months after graduation.

                     It is a federal financial aid requirement that all student loan borrowers complete
                        the Exit Counseling on-line at www.studentloans.gov . This mandate is required by law. Confirmation of the Exit Counseling will be forwarded
