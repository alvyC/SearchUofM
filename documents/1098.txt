                     UofM Student Secures Funding for Start-Up Payment Company
                     
                     May 18, 2015 - Sankaet Pathak, an Entrepreneurship Fellow at the University of Memphis
                        Crews Center for Entrepreneurship, has secured $700,000 in seed funding for his startup
                        company, SynapsePay. Among his investors are Doug Marchant, CEO of Unified Health
                        Services and founder of Concord EFS; Hilliard Crews, chair of Shelby Group International
                        Inc.; and Jeff Webb, founder and CEO of Varsity Brands.
                     
                     
                     Pathak's company, SynapsePay, is a payment network that allows companies and individuals
                        to send and receive funds from their bank accounts using ACH payments and wire transfers.
                        Customers can either integrate SynapsePay's white-labeled payment infrastructure into
                        their applications or use its online dashboard and mobile app to send payments. "We are in the early stages of building a global financial network," says Pathak,
                        who was selected as one of the inaugural class of Crews Center Entrepreneurship Fellows
                        this spring. "Our job is to make the entire payment process easier, cheaper and more
                        secure for everyone involved in a transaction."
                     
                     
                     SynapsePay already processes payments for a diverse set of customers, ranging from
                        rental and payroll groups to crowd-funding platforms and currency exchanges. Its mobile
                        app is also accepted as a payment option at several Memphis-area restaurants and businesses.
