                           Cytoskeleton, with an emphasis on intermediate filaments and their interaction with
                              actin filaments. We are especially interested in intermediate filament protein synemin
                              and its binding to the actin filament bundling protein a-actinin.
                           
                           Role of intermediate filaments in the motility of astrocytoma of cells. Astrocytoma
                              cells express four intermediate filament proteins, including vimentin, nestin, GFAP,
                              and synemin. We are examining the respective contributions of these proteins to the
                              motility of astrocytoma cells as well as the mechanisms involved.
                           
                           Involvement of intermediate filament proteins, and of synemin in particular, in P13K/Akt
                              signalling.
                           
                           Functional differences between a-actinin 1 and 4, two a-actinin isoforms differently
                              regulated during brain development and critical for the motility and proliferation
                              of normal and malignant neural cells.
