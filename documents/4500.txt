                        2015 comparisons. As you can see, our total headcount is 21,521 (3.3% up over 2015)
                        and our total credit hours are 2452,550 (up 3.8% over 2015). A few numbers that are

                        in 2015 (growth of 30.2%). Additionally, the UofM enrolled a total of 4,863 new students
                        (freshman and transfers), the largest number in at least a decade and up 23% over
                        last year. Of particular importance, our Honors College continues to be the largest
                        in the state of Tennessee with over 500 new freshman joining their ranks this year.
                        Not only have we grown, but we have been able to do so by maintaining our commitment
                        to recruiting quality students. This year's average ACT is 22 and the average high
                        school GPA is 3.4, both identical to those over the past five years. The impressiveness
                        of this year's growth is magnified by the previously mentioned fact that we have graduated
                        record numbers of students over the past three years.
                     
                     
                     Our efforts to advance the Tax Incremental Financing (TIF) in the University Neighborhood
                        Districts will only help solidify efforts to enhance the residential and community
                        environment at the UofM. We are optimistic about support, both among our county commissioners
                        and city council members. There are good days ahead for our University. Thank you
                        for your hard work and continued commitment to our students and community.
