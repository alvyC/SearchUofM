                     BA social work candidate Jacqueline Murray presented her research titled "Transgender
                        Healthcare Disparities" at the Works in Progress Symposium (WIPS) held at the University
                        of Memphis on October 31, 2016. Jacqueline discussed challenges and other inequalities
                        that promote healthcare disparities among transgender individuals, and offered preliminary
                        findings from conducting her research. Her thesis advisor, Dr. Lamont Simmons, said
                        it was an honor to assist Jackie with her research, and stated that "her work is an
                        initial step toward pursuing her goal of earning a Ph.D."

                     Â 
                     
                     The Department of Social Work isÂ pleased to announce that MSW student Andre Hitchcock
                           has received a 2016-17 CSWE Minority FellowshipÂ 
                     
                     
                     
                     This fellowship is funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
                        (SAMSHA). The MFP-Youth Master's Fellowship is given to advanced year social work
                        students who are committed to providing mental health services to at-risk children,
                        adolescents, and young adults in underserved minority communities.
                     
                     
                     The CSWE Minority Fellows Program (MFP) has a long history of mentoring advanced social
                        work professionals at both master's and doctoral levels who are racial/ethnic minorities.
                        The program has made significant strides in increasing the racial/ethnic diversity
                        of the profession of social work. The selection process is highly competitive. So,
                        it a great honor for Andre to have been selected. Andre also has the distinction of
                        being the first University of Memphis student to ever receive this award.
                     
                     
                     Congratulations Andre!

                     Connecting the Dots: Supporting Local Law Enforcement in their Responses to Community
                           Trauma
                     
                     The Defending Childhood Initiative (DCI) provided funding for the Department of Social
                        Work to develop and distribute agency resource manuals for law enforcement officers
                        at the Airways Station in Memphis, TN. The manuals will equip officers with agency
                        information that should be useful in their work in addressing trauma and violence
                        in the communities surrounding the Airways Station. The manuals include resources
                        related to domestic violence, alcohol and drug services, adults and children with
                        disabilities, emergency housing and shelter, and churches. The project's Principal
                        Investigator, Dr. Lamont Simmons, stated that "these manuals will serve as a critical
                        resource for officers to promote the healthy development of children, families, and
                        communities inflicted by trauma and violence." Dr. Simmons attributes collaboration
                        among the Department of Social Work (Christy Peterson, Lamont Simmons, and Graduate
                        Assistants), the Memphis Police Department Airways Station (Officer April Colbert
                        and Colonel Joe Oakley), the Network for Overcoming Violence and Abuse (NOVA), and

                        Disabilities (Belinda Tate-Hardy, Chief of Social Work) for the project's success.
