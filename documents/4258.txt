                        mesenchymal cells. This epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key biological
                        process during normal development that is reactivated in several pathologies including
                        organ fibrosis and cancer metastasis. One goal of this research is to identify novel
                        master regulators of EMT and the reverse process MET. This information will be used
                        in designing new strategies for regenerative medicine and the treatment of EMT related
                        pathologies. Projects in the lab use molecular, cellular and embryological tools to
                        identify regulators of EMT. Student projects are dependent on previous knowledge and
                        experience, and include tissue culture of genetically altered stem cells, isolation
                        of RNA, preparation of cDNA, measurement of gene expression changes, isolation and
                        separation of protein, and measurement of protein levels and activity.

                        receptor and growth factor receptor mechanisms of  action. Current projects are focused
                        on the role of PTH-dependent activation of growth factor receptors in the regulation
                        of kidney and vascular smooth cell growth, differentiation, and gene expression.

                     Project Description : These are laboratory-based research projects that investigate
                        host-tick relationships at the cell and molecular level, especially how the tick is
                        able to control wound healing in the host and how the tick is able to recruit new
                        blood vessels (angiogenesis) into the tick feeding lesion. Students will use a variety
                        of preparation techniques including cell based wound-healing and angiogenesis assays.
                        The project may include some microscopy. We have access to scanning and transmission
                        electron microscopes, a confocal scanning laser microscope and an atomic force microscope.
                        Students will be directly involved with research and may be involved with care of
                        experimental animals, both ticks and hosts.

                     Project Description : In mammals, circadian clocks regulate many aspects of 24-hr rhythms in behavior and
                              physiology, and give organisms an adaptive advantage by preparing for transitions
                              between day and night. In the natural world, the sun’s daily cycle dictates the measure
                              of a day. However, our modern 24/7 life-styles impose external timing constrains that
                              clash with our internal circadian physiology, often causing health problems (e.g.,
                              shift worker fatigue, sleep disorders and jet lag). My research concerns how the circadian
                              clock is made up and run at multiple levels of circadian organization, i.e., at the
                              molecular, cellular and tissue, as well as at the organismal level. (for more details,

                           will be given to students enrolled in Biochemistry Lab (Biology 4503). Applicants
                           will be expected to work at least three hours per week per semester for every hour
                           of academic credit awarded.

                     Project Description : To subclone cDNAs encoding specific domains of cytoskeletal
                        proteins such as synemin and alpha-actinin into an eukaryotic expression vector and
                        to express those domains into astrocytoma (brain tumor) cells in order to gain insights
                        into the functions of these domains.  For this project, the student will learn basic
                        molecular biology techniques such as PCR, bacterial transformation, DNA purification,
                        agarose gel electrophoresis and ligation of DNA fragments into plasmid. Other methods that may also be used depending on the scope
                           of the project include: tissue culture, immunofluorescence staining and confocal fluorescence
                           microscopy.
