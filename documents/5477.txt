                     You may complete this degree entirely online by combining online courses with courses
                        offered at the University of Memphis campus; or by combining University of Memphis
                        courses (online and on campus) with a limited number of approved courses transferred
                        from other institutions (see our undergraduate catalog for more information). Students who successfully complete the Bachelor of Arts in History learn to read critically
                        and analytically both primary and secondary sources, to appreciate the complexity
                        of historical issues and the multiplicity of historical views, to investigate historical
                        questions and communicate the results of these investigations.
