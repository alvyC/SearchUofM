                     The Tennessee Institute for Pre-Law (TIP) program is an "admission by performance"
                        program for Tennessee and border county residents who are not admitted through the
                        regular admissions process, but who show potential for academic success in the study
                        of law and bring diversity to the class. TIP seeks to matriculate students from diverse
                        backgrounds and circumstances who are capable of successfully participating in law
                        school curricular and co-curricular programs.
                     
                     
                     The TIP program is a five-week program of classroom instruction that simulates the
                        first-year law school curriculum. The program is held at the University of Memphis
                        School of Law beginning in mid-June and ending in late July. Please note: If you are
                        taking the June 2017 LSAT, you cannot be considered for the Summer 2017 TIP class. 
                        TIP classes begin prior to the release of June test results.
                     
                     
                     Applicants who are admitted into TIP and successfully complete the summer program
                        will be eligible for Fall 2017 admission to the University of Memphis School of Law.
