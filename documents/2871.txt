            About Crowdfunding

        
            MomentUM is the University of Memphis crowdfunding platform for community fundraising. Crowdfunding offers our donors a new avenue to provide support directly to the schools, programs, and specific projects at the university that are most meaningful to them.

Crowdfunding also assists our faculty and students achieve their philanthropic goals. Crowdfunding ideas: innovative projects, service trips, events, research, and other UofM-specific ventures.

3 PHASES OF A PROJECT:

QUIET PHASE ( campaign pre-launch )

• This phase should begin approximately 4-6 weeks before the project’s launch date.

• This time will be spent getting your campaign ready (writing content, creating videos, compiling your email list, developing strategies, etc.).

• Your group will have several meetings with a University of Memphis MomentUM coordinator to help you develop and plan your project.

ACTIVE PHASE ( campaign launch )

• This phase will last 30-45 days and constitutes the live campaign.

• These weeks are crucial! During the campaign, team members are expected to send out at least six (6) email “asks” to their personal contact lists, make four (4) or more updates to their project page, push out asks via social media, and otherwise make themselves available to answer questions about and raise awareness around their project.

FULFILLMENT PHASE ( post-campaign )

• After the project, groups are responsible for sending out thank-you emails, final updates, and any promised perks to donors.

• Remember—making your donors feel special now means that they will want to come back and support your next project.

        

        


    
        University of Memphis FAQ
    

        
                    
                        What is MomentUM?

                    
                    
                        MomentUM is the University of Memphis community fundraising platform. UofM groups create crowdfunding projects to raise money for innovative projects, service trips, events, research and other UofM-specific ventures.

                    
                    
                        Who can use MomentUM to raise money?

                    
                    
                        MomentUM project users must be part of the University of Memphis community via an academic department, student group or other official entity. MomentUM projects must support UofM’s overall mission by improving our community—on campus and beyond. MomentUM assists UofM faculty, staff and students raise awareness about causes and achieve their fundraising goals. Crowdfunding works best for projects and campaigns with clear and specific goals, rather than for general, unrestricted fundraising.

                    
                    
                        Who can donate to MomentUM?

                    
                    
                        The beauty of crowdfunding is everyone can donate to MomentUM! It’s another avenue to provide support directly to University of Memphis schools, programs and specific projects that are most meaningful to them. Having something specific to support often inspires people to embrace giving. Today’s donors want to know where their money is going and how it will make an impact.

                    
                    
                        How will people learn about my project on MomentUM?

                    
                    
                        Crowdfunding relies on personal networking—your best supporters love the UofM, but they really love you and your project. Crowdfunding is a peer-to-peer solicitation rather than an institutional solicitation. Use your personal, group, department or team’s email lists, Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, LinkedIn groups, etc. to promote your project. It’s best to bring your own “crowd.” If you and your team do not have a pre-existing audience (personal or otherwise), then crowdfunding might not be the best platform to raise money for your project.

                    
                    
                        How much can I expect to raise through MomentUM?

                    
                    
                        Typical crowdfunding projects attract between $1,000 and $10,000. Of course, this number will depend entirely on the size of your potential donor pool, your personal contacts and the amount of personal effort devoted to the project. It is best to set modest, attainable and realistic goals—and transcend them. Your donors will be inspired to support a project if it reflects success and MomentUM.

                    
                    
                        How much time will it take to create and manage a project through MomentUM?

                    
                    
                        Project campaigns run for 30-45 days, but plan on your project requiring 10-12 weeks of focused, intense work before and after the campaign. The project creator will need to provide updates and remain actively engaged (new videos, such social media postings as Twitter and Facebook, campus events and email). It is recommended that the project creator commit 1 hour per day, and each team member commit 30-60 minutes per day, for the length of the active campaign.

                    
                    
                        What materials will I need to create and manage a project through MomentUM?

                    
                    
                        A proven way of encouraging donors to embrace and support your cause through crowdfunding is with an emotional and compelling fundraising page. When possible, create such a page with pictures and videos that tell a convincing and irresistible story, as well as explain how much money is needed and how funds will be utilized.

                    
                    
                        Who manages the MomentUM platform?
