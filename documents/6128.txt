                     As a student, it is important that you play an active role in your advising, to ensure
                        that you remain on track with your degree program schedule and to maximize the time

                           chosen major and concentration well enough to plan your own progress toward degree

                        Keep current on academic policies, procedures, and requirements by reviewing the current
