                     See how the Hooks Institute and Special Collections at the McWherter Library are working
                           to preserve the civil rights history of the Mid-South!
                     
                        
                     
                      
                     
                     In 1998, Dr. Hooks donated his personal papers to the University of Memphis (UofM).
                        These papers chronicle his legal, civil rights, and public service career. The Hooks
                        Institute managed the cataloging of these papers.
                     
                     
                     William Love, Collection Specialist, is assisting the Hooks Institute and the UofM
                        Ned R. McWherter Library to digitize portions of Dr. Hooks's archival material and
                        photographs from his personal collection, time at the NAACP, and more.
                     
                     
                     In 2006, the University of Memphis acquired photographs, documents, and other primary
                        source materials from activists of the Fayette County, TN Civil Rights Movement. That
                        Movement began in 1959 when African Americans demanded the right to vote. The Hooks
                        Institute acquired these primary source materials and managed their cataloging.
                     
                     
                     Both the Hooks Papers and the Fayette County Collection contain contemporaneous records
                        of local and national events, and are invaluable resources on the Civil Rights Movement.
                     
                     
                     We encourage the general public to contact the Hooks Institute with documents, photos,
                        and any other relevant materials concerning issues of human and civil rights that
                        can be added to the archive Special Collections at the University of Memphis. Please
