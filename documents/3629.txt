                     The University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law new Children's Defense
                        Clinic will offer supervised student attorneys the opportunity to provide legal representation
                        to youth facing criminal charges in delinquency proceedings in the Shelby County Juvenile
                        Court. Clinic students will complete a curriculum designed to provide training in
                        the handling of delinquency cases, to enhance the vital lawyering skills students
                        will use in their casework and in practice beyond, and to expose students to the complex
                        legal, policy, social, and economic issues that arise in the juvenile justice and
                        criminal defense settings. The clinic will emphasize team practice and collaboration,
                        and, where possible, develop and seize on interdisciplinary partnerships to provide
                        broadly focused, multi-systemic advocacy for Clinic clients.
                     
                     
                     It is anticipated that the Children's Defense Clinic will provide direct representation
                        to children in all phases of delinquency cases. Students will also engage in systemic
                        reform through policy advocacy and it is further hoped that the clinic will assist
                        in the development of training materials and conduct training programs for practicing
                        lawyers focused on best practices in juvenile criminal defense.
