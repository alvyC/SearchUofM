		Phishing Email

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		Recently, you may have received email messages asking you to upgrade, update, or confirm your email account.  These phishing messages often ask you to respond with your username and password, or to click on a link to a non-Memphis website and input your personal credentials.  Please be aware that these messages are not legitimate and can be disregarded.
Information Technology Services (ITS) will never ask you for your username and password via email or over the phone, or ask you to verify your account to keep it from being disabled.
If you receive an email message that has a suspicious link, or asks you for account details such as your username and password, you can report the message to ITS staff via email at abuse@memphis.edu or over the phone by calling the ITS Service Desk at (901) 678-8888.  Further information regarding keeping your University account safe can be found at http://www.memphis.edu/its/security /.
Thank you,
Ellen
