                        About Dr. Trapp
                        
                         
                        
                        Dr. Micah Trapp received her Ph.D. in anthropology from American University in 2011. Her dissertation research focused on transnational household economies, status, and
                           the migratory experiences of Liberian refugees in light of the enduring impact of
                           the American Colonization Society's settlement of Liberia. This research was conducted
                           at the Buduburam Liberian refugee camp in Ghana and addressed the complex processes
                           associated with the shifts from formal to informal aid in a long-term camp and the
                           eventual UNHCR cessation clause of refugee status for Liberians. Her more recent work
                           has focused on taste and the politics of necessity in food assistance programming.
                           As an applied anthropologist, Dr. Trapp has worked for two refugee resettlement agencies
                           in the US and has also worked on a USAID evaluation team.
                        
                        
                        In 2013, Dr. Trapp began conducting ethnographic research at grocery auctions in Southern
                           Maryland and in the Mid-South region. Situated at the crux of the industrialized food
                           system and alternative food movements, this work explores the tension between conformity
                           and resistance in the value of food at the grocery auction. Drawing upon Nancy Munn's
                           transformational theory of value (and attendant notions of communal, positive, negative,
                           and subversive value) and David Graeber's ethnographic theory of value, I argue that
                           the communal value of the deal at the grocery auction becomes political through the
                           production of refurbished commodities that do not simply reproduce the capitalist,
                           industrialized food system, but render its exploits and inequalities visible.

                        Most recently, Dr. Trapp began research on school lunch in Memphis, TN. In collaboration
                           with students enrolled in her Food, Culture, Power course, Dr. Trapp conducted an
                           exploratory study of student food choices and preferences in a charter elementary
                           school. Dr. Trapp presented the preliminary findings on meal typologies and food preferences
                           to the Memphis and Shelby County Food Advisory Council and is designing a larger school
                           lunch study that will explore food supply chains, food labor, and the meaning and
                           practice of lunch. In collaboration with GrowMemphis and students in Ethnographic
                           Methods, Dr. Trapp is also conducting research on how food assistance programs (Double
                           Greens) influence access to fresh fruits and vegetables at farmer's markets.
