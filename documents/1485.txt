                     The Department offers three majors: advertising, journalism, and public relations.
                        Graduates of the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media typically work as newspaper

                        have a 2.0 grade point average in journalism classes to graduate.

                        of Journalism and Strategic Media. Students are recommended to have a minor; each
                        major has recommended minors.

                     All undergraduate students are required to develop and maintain an active portfolio
                        of their work. Students are to begin the portfolio in JOUR 2121 and contribute to
                        it during every skills course thereafter. The portfolio should contain samples of
                        the student's work from their courses and/or professional experience and should develop
                        as the student builds skills. Portfolios will undergo a final review while students
                        are enrolled in the capstone course for their major.
