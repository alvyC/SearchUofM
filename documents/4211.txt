                     Rights and Remedies for Whistleblowers under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
                        Pilot Program
                     
                     
                     The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Pilot Program has implemented enhanced whistleblower
                        protections for employees of Federal contractors and subcontractors for the period
                        from July 1, 2013 through January 1, 2017.
                     
                     
                     What is prohibited?
                     
                     As a Federal contractor/subcontractor, the University is prohibited from discharging,
                        demoting, or otherwise discriminating against an employee as a reprisal for disclosing
                        to any of the entities listed below (see Entities/Persons to whom disclosures may
                        be made), information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of any of
                        the following:
                     
                     
                     •  Gross mismanagement of a Federal contract •  Gross waste of Federal funds •   Abuse of authority relating to a Federal contract ("abuse of authority" is defined
                        as an "arbitrary and capricious exercise of authority that is inconsistent with the
                        mission of the executive agency . . . or the successful performance of a[n agency]
                        contract [or grant]") •  A substantial and special danger to public health or safety •  A violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a Federal contract (including
                        the competition for or negotiation of a contract.)
                     
                     
                     Employees who disclose this type of information to the following persons or entities
                        are protected:
                     
                     
                     •   A Member of Congress •   An Inspector General •   The Government Accountability Office •    A Federal Employee responsible for contract oversight or management at the relevant
                        agency •    An authorized official of the Department of Justice or other law enforcement
                        agency •    A court or grand jury •    A management official or other employee of the University who has the responsibility
                        to investigate, discover, or address misconduct
                     
                     
                     The pilot program also protects an employee who initiates or provides evidence of
                        misconduct in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to waste, fraud,
                        or abuse on a federal contract or grant.
                     
                     
                     Submitting Complaints to the University of Memphis
                     
                     An employee of the University who believes that he or she has been discharged, demoted,
                        or otherwise discriminated against for having made a disclosure of the type described
                        above may submit a complaint to Research Compliance within three (3) years of the
                        date on which the alleged reprisal took place.
                     
                     
                     The University is committed to operating with integrity and in full compliance with
                        all applicable laws, regulations, and policies, and it does not tolerate retaliation
                        against individuals who report compliance concerns in good faith.
                     
                     
                     Submitting Complaints to Funding Agencies
                     
                     Whistleblowers may also file complaints with federal agencies if they believe they
                        were discriminated against for their disclosure of information, provided those complaints
                        are submitted within three years of the date of the alleged discrimination. Whistleblowers
                        may submit complaints to the Inspector General of the federal agency involved. The
                        Inspector General will generally perform an investigation and submit a report to the
                        federal agency, which then determines whether sufficient basis exists to conclude
                        that discrimination occurred. If the agency determines that discrimination has occurred,
                        the pilot program sets out remedies that may be available, including ordering an institution
                        to reverse the reprisal, reinstate the employee with compensatory damages and employment
                        benefits, and/or pay costs reasonably incurred by the whistleblower in bringing the
                        complaint. The institution has the right to appeal any agency order to the relevant
                        United States court.
