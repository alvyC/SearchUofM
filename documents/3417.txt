                        Go to the Tiger Zone site at http://www.memphis.edu/tigerzone
                        
                        " Sign In " using your UofM username and password (same as university email)
                        
                        
                        Click the " Organizations " tab in the top right corner of the screen
                        
                        
                        Click " Register a New Organization " on the bottom left
                        
                        
                        Fill out as directed

                           10 student members (6 for Lambuth and 3 for Provisional Status.)
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Registration Pointers
                     
                     
                        
                        Fields without asterisks are not required. You can go back later and complete those
                           fields.
                        
                        
                        Your " Organization Description " will be where the system pulls keywords for searches. The more descriptive you are,
                           the easier it will be for students to find your organization
                        
                        
                        When it asks for " Organization Website url ", it is asking for what you want to show after the slash "/" in your Tiger Zone url.
                           (example "sac"; the url will be provided, but the "/sac" will be added to the end
                           like so: https://memphis.collegiatelink.net/organization/sac )
                        
                        
                        When entering your Officers , they will show up twice, once as an Officer and once as a Member. That is ok, but
                           please make sure you are not counting the person twice toward your 10 members.
                        
                        
                        The Advisor will also show up as a Member, but should not count toward the 10 members.
