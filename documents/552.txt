                     Build Your Resume  - Most service opportunities let you gain real world experience in your chosen field.
                        You will hone your leadership and communication skills and learn firsthand how important
                        it is to be a team player.
                     
                     
                     Learn To Grow  - Volunteering often becomes an "aha" moment that leads you towards new passions
                        and interests. Even though you are helping others, you also wind up learning a lot
                        about yourself in the process.
                     
                     
                     Give Back  - Service hours are an expression of your heartfelt thanks for what others have invested
                        in you. At some point in your life, someone did something that gave you that extra
                        little nudge to keep going. This is your chance to nudge back.
