                     Personal Information Security
                     
                     As more and more information about us moves into "the cloud," it has become critical
                        that we take steps to protect our personal information.  Adopting the recommendations
                        below may improve protection of your personal information and contribute to the protection
                        of University data:
                     
                     
                     Social Networking
                     
                     THINK before you sign up for online groups. They often solicit personal information
                        in order for you to join. Once you provide that information, you have NO CONTROL over
                        how it's used. NEVER provide your University credentials (password, UUID, etc.) to
                        any social network, company, or even your best friend.
                     
                     
                     Phishing
                     
                     Phishing is the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information
                        such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy
                        entity in an electronic communication. The University will never request personal
                        information (i.e., your SSN, UUID and password, birth date, or any account numbers)
                        via email. Other institutions, such as your bank, credit card company, or loan officers,
                        would not email you requesting this type of information, either.
                     
                     
                     E-mail Scams
                     
                     Email Scams are unsolicited emails that claim the prospect of a bargain or something
                        for nothing. Some spam messages ask for business, others invite victims to a website
                        with a detailed sales pitch. Once the email is opened, malware of various sorts may
                        be triggered. While our spam filters catch most of these emails, be alert and delete
                        any suspicious emails without opening them. Use caution in replying to any unsolicited
                        email.
                     
                     
                     Phone Scams
                     
                     Unsuspecting phone customers receive voicemail messages with call back numbers in
                        Caribbean area codes (examples: Area Codes 809, 876, and 284). When calls are made
                        to those numbers, callers are kept on the line with pitches that result in hefty charges.
                        Because these are legitimate area codes, they cannot be blocked. So be alert to these
                        scams, and call back ONLY when you know that the call is authentic.
                     
                     
                     Portable and Hand-Held Devices
                     
                     Remember that PDAs, notebooks, iPads, smart phones, etc. are also vulnerable to security
                        breaches. Be cautious about what information you store on your mobile devices, so
                        that you are less vulnerable if a device is lost or stolen.
