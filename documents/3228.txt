                     Our practicum trainees are selected from both Counseling and Clinical Psychology and
                        Master level programs. We have been accredited by the Office of Program Consultation
                        and Accreditation (OPCA) of the American Psychological Association (APA) since 1988.
                     
                     
                     We embrace a practitioner-scholar model so that both interns and practicum students
                        benefit from professional interaction, supervision, mentoring, and modeling from center
                        staff. While clients' presenting issues may range from developmental concerns to more
                        severe psychological problems, the majority of center counseling is brief due to the
                        nature of university life. An up-dated list of referral resources is available for
                        clients needing more intensive treatment modalities.
