                     The Department of Anthropology offers an honors program in anthropology to the superior

                        discipline, a deeper understanding of research skills, and an opportunity for original
                        criticism and analysis. To be eligible a student must (a) have the approval of the
                        Department Chair, (b) be an anthropology major, (c) have attained at least junior
                        standing, (d) have completed successfully ANTH 1100, 1200, and one upper-division

                        at the Department of Anthropology office.
