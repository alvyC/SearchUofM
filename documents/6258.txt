                        His professional memberships include American Physical Society, American Association
                           of Physics Teachers, International Association of Hydrogen Energy and Fractional Calculus
                           and Applied Analysis. His experimental research (1979-1998) involved hydrogen in metals,
                           hydrogen diffusion and electrotransport, absorption kinetics and hydrogen surface
                           impedance and catalysis. His theoretical research (1998 – present) is in the area
                           of applications of fractional calculus in physics, fractional diffusion, fractional
                           oscillators, and Mittag-Leffler functions.
                        
                        
                        He is a reviewer for several journals and frequently reviews textbooks for publishers.
