                     West Tennessee Healthcare and the University of Memphis Lambuth Announce Significant
                        Nursing Endowment 
                     
                     
                     February 10, 2016- Jackson, Tenn. - West Tennessee Healthcare and the University of
                        Memphis Lambuth are creating a partnership that will have a significant impact on
                        the education of health care professionals in West Tennessee. As part of a larger
                        fundraising effort by UofM-Lambuth, a 2.5 million dollar endowment, funded by West
                        Tennessee Healthcare, will provide scholarships to students enrolled in the Loewenberg
                        College of Nursing at the University of Memphis Lambuth. The announcement was made
                        during a press conference held on the Lambuth campus. 
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis President, Dr. M. David Rudd, in accepting the generous
                        gift on behalf of the University of Memphis, remarked, "We are extremely grateful
                        for the generous endowment from West Tennessee Healthcare.  This gift will provide
                        advanced training which will prepare our West Tennessee nursing practitioners to meet
                        the challenges of a rapidly changing healthcare industry." 
                     
                     
                     The nursing scholarships will be available to students pursuing a traditional Bachelor
                        of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree as well as students pursuing a RN-BSN degree. 
                        Recipients of the scholarship will be residents of Jackson-Madison County or a contiguous
                        county. 
                     
                     
                     Bobby Arnold, President and CEO of West Tennessee Healthcare said, "As the largest
                        provider of healthcare services in West Tennessee, it is essential that we have an
                        available, highly skilled and educated nursing workforce. West Tennessee Healthcare's
                        investment in the endowment creates an opportunity for local individuals to obtain
                        their nursing degree here at the University of Memphis Lambuth and for employment
                        opportunities in Jackson." 
                     
                     
                     In responding to the announcement of the scholarship, Jackson Mayor Jerry Gist said,
                        "The West Tennessee Healthcare nursing scholarship endowment for the University of
                        Memphis Lambuth demonstrates the commitment from community stakeholders to make long-term
                        investments in workforce development. Jackson is unrivaled in the quality and integrity
                        of its workforce. Our people are our greatest asset. Advanced education and training
                        gives our work force a ready advantage to meet the needs of new and expanding industries."
                        Madison County Mayor Jimmy Harris added, "West Tennessee Healthcare, the Foundation,
                        and the University of Memphis Lambuth are organizations that continually show their
                        commitment to our community. This endowment creates an opportunity to strengthen the
                        available workforce for our region's largest industry which will have a lasting positive
                        impact for many years."
                     
                     
                     This scholarship will have a significant impact as well on workforce development and
                        on the work that the Jackson Chamber is doing.  Kyle Spurgeon, Chamber president,
                        said, "A trained and readily available workforce is the most important element of
                        securing new jobs for any community.  The scholarship  endowment and partnership between
                        West Tennessee Healthcare and the University of Memphis Lambuth will provide a pathway
                        for nursing career opportunities already available in Jackson."
                     
                     
                     The endowment will be managed by the West Tennessee Healthcare Foundation under the
                        direction of Frank McMeen.  Kathy Watts, Chair of the Foundation's Board of Trustees
                        said, "The Foundation has a long and successful track record of endowment management.
                        The outcomes from this endowment will have a major impact on so many lives of West
                        Tennesseans."
