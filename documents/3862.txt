                     Libraries Instruction Policies
                     
                     University Libraries faculty provide library instruction to classes and groups in
                        collaboration with faculty in other academic departments to promote information literacy
                        throughout the university curriculum. The University Libraries encourages teaching
                        faculty to consider incorporating an information literacy component into their courses.
                     
                     
                     
                     Faculty planning library instruction should consider the following guidelines:
                     
                     
                        
                        Requests for library instruction should be made as early as possible and must be made at least a week in advance to ensure librarian and room availability and to give the librarian ample time to
                           prepare for the class.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        The instructor should be present at the time of instruction.
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        When possible, a specific assignment should be given that asks students to demonstrate
                           the skills obtained in the library instruction class.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        No food or drink is allowed in the Instruction Center.
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Library instruction is scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Library instruction may be requested for remote sites and for mornings, evenings,
                           and weekends.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        No library instruction will be scheduled for Ned R. McWherter Library at times when
                           the Library is closed.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        All library instruction is scheduled through Instructional Services .
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Room Use Policies
                     
                     The primary use of the Instruction Center is for library instruction. Faculty and
                        staff of The University of Memphis may schedule use of either of the rooms providing
                        that no library instruction is scheduled for that time. Students may not schedule
                        the rooms and are not allowed to use the rooms without a faculty or staff member present.
                     
                     
                     
                     Use of a room is restricted to those who comply with the following guidelines:
                     
                     
                        
                        The rooms are for short-term use only; semester-long courses will not be scheduled.
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Regularly-scheduled meetings or classes will not be pre-scheduled in the Instruction
                           Center.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        The Instruction Center may be limited to library-instruction-related use during September,
                           October, January and February, as these are the busiest months for library instruction.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Requests for non-library-instruction use will not be scheduled more than one week in advance. Exceptions may be made if the
                           requested date falls within the last four weeks of the semester (including Finals
                           week).
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        A University of Memphis employee must be listed as the responsible party and must
                           be present in the room at all times. Students may not schedule the rooms and are not
                           allowed to use the rooms without a faculty or staff member present.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        No food or drink is allowed in the Instruction Center.
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        All responsible parties must arrange for training on the equipment in the Instruction
                           Center prior to use.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        No software should be loaded onto the computers. If software is needed for the training,
                           please inform Instructional Services at the time of scheduling so the University Libraries’ Systems Department may oversee
                           the installation and removal.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        No laptops or other equipment may be connected to the computers in the Instruction
                           Center without prior arrangement with Instructional Services .
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Rooms 225 and 226 will be locked at all times. The responsible party should ask at
                           the Research and Information Services (RIS) Desk (to your right as you enter McWherter
                           Library) to have the reserved room unlocked.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        All instructor station equipment should be turned off and the room returned to its
                           original order before leaving.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        All scheduling is done through Instructional Services .
