The University of Memphis (UofM) Global Learning programs are designed to provide students with the opportunity to combine a rigorous academic program with a cross-cultural learning experience that is not available in the United States.

We offer over 200 semester, academic year and short-term faculty-led programs in 60 countries to meet the diverse needs of the UofM student population.     

Foreign students interested in studying abroad at the University of Memphis should refer to the J-1 International Exchange Student section of the website on the left side of the page.
