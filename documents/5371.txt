                     Residency Classification: All determinations concerning the classification of students as in state or out of
                        state for fee purposes are made in the Office of Admissions. The determinations are
                        based on the regulations and guidelines of the Tennessee Board of Regents. If, for
                        any reason, there is a question about a student's residency classification for fee
                        payment purposes, the student is responsible for requesting a review of his or her
                        residency status before classes begin.
                     
                     
                     Academic Common Market: Participation in the Academic Common Market allows qualified students from southern
                        states to pay in-state tuition while pursuing certain degree programs at the University
                        of Memphis. This arrangement is available only for students whose home states do not
                        offer the designated program. The state in which the student resides determines which
                        of the programs offered by the University of Memphis the home state will make available
                        to its students.
                     
                     
                     The Academic Common Market is sponsored by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB).

                        Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia (Florida and Texas grant access for graduate level
                        programs only). Current SREB common market guidelines and requirements may be found
                        on the web at: http://www.sreb.org/programs/acm/acm/searchacm.asp.
                     
                     Students may request through their home state coordinators that additional programs
                        be made accessible. A list of the state coordinators with their addresses and telephone
                        numbers may be obtained from the Office of Curriculum Planning or the Academic Common
                        Market web site http://www.sreb.org/programs/acm/acm/searchacm.asp.
                     
                     
                     In addition to certification requirements which the student's state of residence may
                        specify, the following pertain: (1) students must be fully admitted to a degree program
                        that has been approved as an Academic Common Market program (non-degree students are
                        ineligible); (2) students must obtain a letter certifying residency term of entry
                        and approval for the particular University of Memphis program from their state's Academic
                        Common Market coordinator.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: After enrollment, students remain eligible for in-state tuition only so long as they
                        are continuously enrolled-consecutive fall and spring terms- in the same major for
                        which they were originally certified. If students change major, they must process
                        a Change of Major through their advisor and notify the Office of Admissions to change
                        the Academic Common Market residency code on their records. Failure to process the Change of Major and to notify Office of Admissions may subject
                           the student to out-of state fees for all subsequent terms of enrollment in classes
                           for a major other than the one for which the student received ACM certification. Missing a fall or spring term of enrollment or a change of major requires that the
                        student be recertified through the ACM coordinator in the student's state or residence.
                     
                     
                     Fees For Totally Disabled Persons And Persons Over 60 Years Of Age: Persons who are domiciled in Tennessee and (1) have a permanent disability that totally
                        incapacitates them from the potential to work at an occupation that brings them an
                        income, or (2) who will become 60 years of age or older during the academic semester
                        in which they begin classes, may AUDIT courses at the University of Memphis without
                        paying tuition charges, maintenance fees, student activity fees, access fees, or registration
                        fees. Admission to AUDIT will be limited on an individual classroom basis according
                        to space availability.
                     
                     
                     Those who are totally disabled and those who will become 65 years of age or older
                        during the academic semester in which they begin classes, and who are domiciled in
                        Tennessee, may enroll for courses for credit at the cost of one-half the normal per
                        credit hour fee, not to exceed $70 per semester.
