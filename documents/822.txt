                     Reorder Diplomas
                     
                     This process is for diploma Reorders/Duplicates ONLY.
                     
                     RECENT GRADUATES : If you have not received your original diploma and it has been more than three months since your commencement, please contact the
                        Commencement Office at 901.678.5547.
                     
                     
                     There is a $20 fee for diploma reorders. Once you complete the form you will have
                        the option to pay on-line or print the form and send in a check payment. Please do
                        not send cash. 
                     
                     
                     Once we receive your reorder request, it will take approximately two weeks for our
                        vendor to process your diploma. When we receive your diploma from our vendor we will
                        mail it to you as you specify below (standard or expedited shipping (once the diploma
                        returns to the office from the vendor)), or you are welcome to pick it up at our office.
                        If you are picking up your diploma in person, please make sure you bring a photo ID.
                        If you would like to specify another individual to pick up your diploma, you must
                        provide documentation to the Commencement Office by emailing us at commencement@memphis.edu .
                     
                     
                     International diploma reorders will be mailed standard shipping only. FedEx overnight
                        shipping is available to USA residences only (excludes Hawaii, Alaska and international)
                        for an extra $18.00 and is non-refundable. If you live outside of the USA, the fast
                        way to receive your diploma may be to indicate "Pick up" on your order form, ask someone
                        who lives in the Memphis area to pick it up for you, then have that person mail it
                        to you expedited mail. In order for us to release your diploma to someone else, we
                        require an authorization email from you granting us permission and the name of the
                        person who will be picking it up.
                     
                     
                     If your name has changed or you would like to order an additional (duplicate) copy
                        of your diploma because of a change in name, former name, etc., please understand
                        that we follow Name Change practices and you may be required to do an official name
                        change with the University. Before placing your order, you may want to contact our
                        office to ensure your diploma will be ordered with the name you prefer and if not,
                        how to go about changing your name.

                     Important : Please note that a returned check or credit card service fee is $30. This fee applies
                        to each check/draft or credit card returned unpaid by your financial institution.
                        This fee will be assessed if a keying error on your part results in your financial
                        institution's failure to honor the draft.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Diplomas are considered state documents and must be provided to the graduate or a
                           designee by the graduate (see above). Diplomas are not submitted electronically to
                           any party. 
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     Lambuth campus diploma inquiries
                     
                     We are sorry, but there is no way to provide a copy or duplicate of a Lambuth University
                           diploma, since the University is now closed. 
                     
                     However, the current University of Memphis Lambuth campus does keep Lambuth academic
                        records and you can request proof of graduation by obtaining a transcript, very easily.
                        The transcript request form found online at http://www.memphis.edu/registrar/students/records/lambuth.php  and fax it to (731) 425-1916 or you can speak with Ann Childs at (731) 425-1988.
