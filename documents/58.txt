                     All of the colleges and schools at the University of Memphis are dedicated to serving
                        our communities in Memphis, throughout Tennessee, and across the globe. The College
                        of Communication and Fine Arts (CCFA) continues to serve as a model of creativity,
                        exploration, outreach and service to be emulated.
                     
                     
                     In the most recent CCFA Voices magazine, you can read about our journalism and strategic
                        media students who traveled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to write about the Olympics.
                        We have also provided a glimpse of the travels our music students as they journeyed
                        through Europe playing concerts in Austria and Italy and taking classes from internationally
                        renowned master musicians.
                     
                     
                     The University of Memphis is embedded in our community and we are always looking to
                        grow our partnerships. It was an exciting day when we were able to announce a very
                        unique partnership between the University of Memphis Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music
                        and the Memphis Symphony Orchestra. Read about how the future of music training, performance
                        and outreach is changing because of the Memphis Symphony Orchestra in Residence program
                        at the University of Memphis.
