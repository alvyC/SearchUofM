                     Project Description: CPGIS performs a number of services to local, state and federal
                        government as well as NPO’s on mapping spatial features and conducting spatial analyses
                        using geographic information systems, or GIS.  GIS is a very powerful tool for building,
                        identifying and analyzing spatial connectivity between features whether it be identifying
                        the shortest ambulatory route from the hospital to a home, mapping habitat impairments
                        along a stream, finding trends in health for epidemiology, or creating a network of
                        man-made infrastructure.  Hence, GIS is used in geography, engineering, business,
                        medical, biology, archeology, computer science, city planning, law, and many more
                        fields.  CPGIS hires students from nearly 12 different departments to work in interdisciplinary
                        teams on projects both in the field and in the lab.  Knowing GIS is not a requirement
                        as we will teach you the software – you will learn some of the most advanced functions
                        of GIS making you quite marketable upon graduation.  All workers are paid well with
                        raises given based on productivity and added responsibility.
                     
                     
                     Requirements:  Provide a resume to Dr. Waldron.  Students must be able to work at
                        least 10 hours a week.  Employment is continued during the summer.
                     
                     
                     Starting date:  Hiring occurs throughout the year based on project demands.
                     
                     Method of compensation: Hourly wages.  You do NOT need to be a full-time student to
                        work at CPGIS.

                     Project Description: Our research group focuses on earthquake simulations and the
                        prediction of earthquake effects. Research tasks for an undergraduate student in our
                        group will concentrate on helping develop computer tools to analyze results from simulations
                        and to compare simulation results with recorded data. In particular, we have several
                        ongoing projects that require the development of software to process results. We would
                        like these tools to be developed in Python. Therefore, we are looking for bright enthusiastic
                        minds willing to apply (and learn) programming skills to scientific research. Support
                        for interested undergraduate students could extend beyond the Summer Honors program
                        if the student demonstrate abilities that are worth keeping in our group.
                     
                     
                     Requirements for Student Applicants: In general, this project requires having good
                        programming skills. Preference will be give to someone with knowledge in Python, but
                        we will consider someone who can learn Python rapidly. We assume that if the student
                        is already enrolled in the Honors program, good academic record is understood as by
                        default.
                     
                     
                     Start Date: Anytime
                     
                     Method of compensation: Volunteer or academic credit through a project course. Monetary
                        compensation will be considered for skilled individuals.
