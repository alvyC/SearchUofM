                     Our Ocean has Become a Graveyard: The Social and Environmental Crisis in Southern
                           Chile's Archipelago of Chiloé Anton Daughters, Truman State University Thursday, November 10, 2016 Reception at 5:30 PM, Lecture at 6:00 PM This lecture is cosponsored by the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures,
                        the Department of Anthropology, the International Studies Program, the Environmental
                        Studies Program, and the Marcus W. Orr Center for the Humanities. Forty years ago, southern Chile's Archipelago of Chiloé was a rural, politically marginalized
                        province of little economic import to most Chileans. Today it is one of the world's
                        leading exporters of farmed salmon and an increasingly popular destination for tourists.
                        This rapid shift into the global economy has triggered a series of social and environmental
                        crises that came to a peak in May of this year when protesters cut off access to the
                        archipelago for more than two weeks. Drawing on participant observation fieldwork
                        and repeated visits to Chiloé from 2002 to 2016, this lecture traces the recent history
                        of the archipelago and discuss the cultural and economic challenges that globalization
                        has created for residents of this unique austral region.

                     Dr. Patrick Manning will give a talk, entitled Inequality: Global Histories and Modern Concerns, on Thursday,
                        November 3, at 6:00 pm in the River Room (300), University Center on the U of M campus.
                        There will be a reception at 5:30 pm. Inequality in contemporary society clashes with
                        the growing belief in the value of social equality. What is the history of inequality?
                        This talk describes the research design and preliminary results of the CHIA study
                        of socio-economic inequality worldwide since 1600 CE. More broadly, it asks, is inequality
                        functional for human society, or does it cause waste?
