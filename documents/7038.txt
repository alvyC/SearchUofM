                           Italian certified architectural engineer and planner with a PhD (2006) in City and
                              Regional Planning and Design from the University of Catania, Italy. With a background
                              integrating planning and geographic analysis, architecture and design, social sciences,
                              and environmental sciences, her areas of specialization cross the traditional disciplinary
                              boundaries of land-use planning, urban design, landscape architecture, environmental
                              studies, historic preservation, and community development. Her research focus is on
                              the theory and the practice of ecological approaches to planning and design, i. e.
                              approaches able to improve the relationship between humans, other living communities
                              and their life environment. Laura has developed her scholarship through a highly engaged
                              research approach, inspired by the action-research paradigm.
