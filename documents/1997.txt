                     The Epidemiology (Epi) Doctoral Program is designed for students who want to conduct
                        original research in epidemiology and become productive, independent investigators.
                        Graduates will be well-prepared for careers in academia, consulting, healthcare, and
                        translational research, with extensive knowledge of sophisticated scientific theories
                        and rigorous epidemiologic research methods.
                     
                     
                     The Epi Doctoral Program focuses on urban health, health disparities, and community
                        involvement in health promotion, and offers concentrations in epidemiology, environmental
                        health, and biostatistics. Students work closely with faculty mentors in such research
                        areas as aging, cardiovascular disease, sickle cell disease, epigenetics, pediatric
                        obesity, cancer survivorship, and global health, to identify major public health problems
                        and promote evidence-based public health interventions and policies to prevent disease
                        and improve quality of life.
                     
                     
                     A master's degree is required for admission. Applicants must demonstrate potential
                        for further study by having maintained an average GPA of 3.0 or higher in their master's
                        level coursework, and a competitive score on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE).
                        Other professional school standardized test scores (MCAT, DAT, GMAT or LSAT) may be
                        substituted for the GRE by applicants who are working toward or who have already earned
                        post-baccalaureate degree in medicine, dentistry, management or law.
                     
                     
                     Application materials will be reviewed by the faculty admissions committee. Admissions
                        decisions are based on the overall quality of the applicant's scholarship and academic
                        abilities as demonstrated by GPA, standardized test score(s), undergraduate and graduate
                        completed coursework, research experience and recommendation letters, as well as alignment
                        of the applicant's research interests and career goals with those of the program.
                     
                     
                     Consideration is given to the following in determining admissions to a professional
                        degree program: • Average grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or higher on a four-point scale for master's
                        level coursework • A recent (within 5 years) GRE total score (verbal, quantitative and analytical writing
                        combined) • Applicants already holding a doctoral degree or professional equivalent obtained
                        in the US may be exempt from the GRE requirement; other standardized test scores (MCAT,
                        DAT, GMAT, or LSAT) may be substituted for the GRE by applicants who are working toward
                        or have completed a post-baccalaureate degree • Three letters of recommendation • Applicant's written statement of purpose (750-1000 words) of interests and career
                        goals • Applicants whose native language is not English are expected to have a score of
                        96 or higher on the Test for English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)

                     A limited number of graduate assistantships (GA) are available for students admitted
                        to the program full-time.  The GA includes tuition waivers during the 9-month academic
                        year and a monthly stipend in exchange for working 20 hours per week on projects with
                        a faculty mentor. The Epi PhD program provides three years of GA support, contingent
                        upon satisfactory student progress through the academic program and work performance.
