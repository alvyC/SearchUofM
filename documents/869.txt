                     The Division of Research and Sponsored Programs began a process in 2014 to support
                        the growth of sponsored programs, improve the efficiency and transparency of research
                        administration, and automate outdated systems.  In order to achieve these goals, the
                        Division of Research and Sponsored Programs is collaborating with IT in leading a
                        team to  implement an electronic research administration (eRA) software installation.
                     
                     
                     Throughout spring and fall 2016, staff and faculty will be testing, piloting and rolling
                        out a new eRA system, Evisions Research Suite (commonly called Cayuse), that will
                        track, route and manage all of the steps of a sponsored project lifecycle, from pre-award
                        to post-award.  In addition, we have purchased Cayuse IRB, which will manage initial
                        IRB submissions, modifications, reportable events, and continuing reviews all in one

                     This webpage will serve as place to get updates on the implementation, then serve
                        as the launching pad for the software once it is fully implemented.
