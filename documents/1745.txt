                     Brecht and Weill turned to John Gay's 18th-century The Beggar's Opera to fashion this
                        savage, biting commentary on bourgeois capitalism and modern morality. Set in Victorian
                        London, the bitter tale is told of the predatory outlaw known as Mack the Knife. He
                        secretly marries the daughter of Soho's underworld boss, but is soon betrayed by his
                        sinister in-laws and sent to prison. After being freed by the police chief's daughter,
                        he is again betrayed- this time by a prostitute-and sentenced to death.
