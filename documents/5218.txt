                        by William C. Love
                        
                     
                     
                     On March 10, 1981, Benjamin L. Hooks, Executive Director of the NAACP, stood before
                        the third annual NAACP Legislative Mobilization at a Baptist church in Washington,
                        D.C. to address what to him were the shortcomings of newly inaugurated president Ronald
                        Reagan’s political agenda. Reagan in his inaugural address, less than two months earlier,
                        had presented his case that the two main challenges to the current United States economy
                        were runaway inflation and federal regulation, both of which stemmed from the governmental
                        overreach of the 1970s. To stimulate the economy, Reagan proposed policies he believed
                        would decrease the role of government and augment the private self-rule of its citizens,
                        including lowering marginal tax rates and ending the manipulation of government by
                        special interest groups. To quote one of Reagan’s most memorable lines, “In this present
                        crisis, government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.”
                        Hooks’ rebuttal to Reagan before the Legislative Mobilization was not a clarion call
                        for more governmental intervention in the lives of African-Americans. Rather, Hooks
                        argued for the inevitable wealth disparity that would continue should we approach
                        the United States economy as an egalitarian market place, where all citizens exercise
