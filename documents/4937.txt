                        About Gavin Bidelman
                        
                        Dr. Bidelman joined the faculty in 2012. Dr. Bidelman directs the Auditory Cognitive
                           Neuroscience Laboratory located in the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders
                           at the University of Memphis. The lab uses a multifaceted approach to study the neural
                           encoding of complex sound (e.g., speech and music) at both pre-attentive and cognitive
                           levels of brain processing. Methods include a coordinated blend of auditory evoked
                           potentials (AEPs), psychoacoustics, and computational modeling. Current lab projects
                           are focused on understanding the neurocomputations involved in generating basic psychoacoustic
                           phenomena and during complex music/speech listening. A special focus of the lab is
                           to better understanding the connection between neuroelectric brain activity elicited
                           by auditory events and human behavior. Complementary work examines how different listening
                           experiences and/or training (e.g., music lessons, bilingualism) influence an individual's
                           auditory skills and how these benefits might transfer to improve seemingly unrelated
                           cognitive abilities. We are particularly interested in how musical training improves
                           speech- and language-related skills.
