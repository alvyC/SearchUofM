                     Morgan Morton, a Fogelman College alumnus and supporter established the Morgan Morton Study Abroad Fund 
                              . This fund is designed to stimulate international and domestic travel for undergraduate,
                        masters and Ph.D. business students. Priority is given for international travel and
                        to undergraduate students in their final year of study. The travel fund is intended
                        to enhance students' learning about businesses (both for-profit and not-for-profit)
                        and to further their professional development.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           
                            
                                  The University of Memphis Morgan Morton Study Abroad Fund
                           
                        
                        
                        A selection committee appointed by the Dean's office selects the applicants based
                           on merit, and also determines the amount of monetary support the student receives.
                           The estimated amount of support per student is typically between $500 and $1500. However,
                           this amount may change based upon the demand for funding, and generally, higher amounts
                           will be awarded for international travel.
                        
                        
                        Students who are selected to receive travel funds will be required to submit a written
                           report or make a presentation detailing the learning experiences of the trip upon
                           return. Students may travel individually or as a group, but must be in good academic
                           standing with the University. The purpose of individual travel may include attending
                           conferences, traveling for internships or studying abroad. Group travel, for example,
                           may include traveling for case competitions. University faculty and staff may be eligible
                           to use this fund, but only if a chaperone is deemed necessary for student learning.
