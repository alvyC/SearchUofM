Comments from the President
	
		The University of Memphis is pleased to present this Emergency Preparedness Guide to assist you with the process of preparing to respond and recover from every type of disaster. As part of a community, whether a quiet college campus or a active major city, each of us must be aware of the role and responsibility that we have regarding issues of safety.
 		BE AWARE � BE PREPARED � HAVE A PLAN
		If you do these three things, the life you save could be your own �      because what you DON�T know CAN hurt you. The information in this manual was compiled from various publications provided by the American Red Cross and FEMA to assist you in preparing for various types of disasters. 
Please take a break for just a short period and sit with roommates, fraternity or sorority members, family and friends while reading this manual to discuss how each of you would handle these types of situations.
