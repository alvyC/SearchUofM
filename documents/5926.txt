                     The Department has been fortunate to receive several generous gifts from donors. Gifts
                        can endow professorships, scholarships, fellowships, classrooms, and labs for our
                        students. They can also be used to help defray travel expenses for conferences to
                        present research papers, as well as many other activities that are extremely meaningful

                     Peter I. Neathery (1942-2000)
                     
                     An alumnus of Hendrix College and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, Peter
                        I. Neathery was a doctoral candidate in computer science at the University of Memphis,
                        where he distinguished himself in several classes and coauthored papers with faculty
                        of the Department. Mr. Neathery's generous gift to the Department has made possible
                        the endowment of the Peter I. Neathery Scholarship and Fellowship Fund . The fund will award scholarships and graduate fellowships to deserving undergraduate
                        and graduate students in computer science for generations to come.
                     
                     
                     Additionally, Mr. Neathery's gift supports the Peter I. Neathery Colloquium Fund,
                        which allows us to hold our Colloquium Series each Spring and Fall semester.

                     The C. E. and S. Foundation and Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Smith provided funding to establish
                        an endowment to honor the memory of Matt Smith. The fund allowed the Department to
                        award the Matt Smith Memorial Scholarship for a number of years, with preference given
                        to incoming freshmen from Collierville High School with plans to major in Computer
                        Science.
