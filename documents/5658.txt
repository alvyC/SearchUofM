                     The Talented 10%: Recruiting the Top 10 Percent of High School Graduates
                     
                     September 4, 2015 - The University of Memphis is pleased to announce the launch of
                        a new recruitment program called the Talented 10%. As the only institution in the
                        Tennessee Board of Regents system classified by the prestigious Carnegie Foundation
                        as a Research University with High Activity (RU/HA) and the university with the largest
                        Honors Program in the state, the UofM plans to cast a wider net across the country
                        to attract the top 10 percent of every graduating high school class to contribute
                        to the generation of new scholarship and innovative ideas.
                     
                     
                     This recruitment initiative will intensify the UofM's focus on academic excellence,
                        enhance its national and regional diversity, increase access, and extend its efforts
                        to target students whose multiple intelligences and talents are exhibited in a variety
                        of ways.
                     
                     
                     A primary goal of the state of Tennessee and at the University of Memphis is to increase
                        degree completion rates. National data continue to show that high academic performance
                        during the high school years is one of the best predictors of timely graduation. Jon
                        Erickson, former president of the ACT, stated in an interview with the Chronicle of
                        Higher Education last week that the ACT score is one quality measure. "I still see
                        the high school record and transcript as being definitive. That's long-term behavior,
                        which is typically your best predictor of success in college."
                     
                     
                     How do we create a more knowledgeable and informed citizenry to become leaders of
                        the future? "There can be but one answer: The best and most capable of our youth must
                        be schooled in the colleges and universities of the land" (W.E.B. Du Bois, 1903).
                        The University of Memphis aims to become the destination institution for the top 10
                        percent of high school seniors across the country.
