                     University of Memphis Initiates Biologistics Research
                     
                     January 7, 2016 - Two key research Institutes at the University of Memphis – the FedEx
                        Institute of Technology and the Intermodal Freight Transportation Institute – have
                        come together to launch a new Biologistics Research Cluster. This partnership is the
                        result of a strategic push to develop national-level research competencies in the
                        emerging area of biologistics. The two research Institutes are partnering to fund
                        nine interdisciplinary biologistics projects by investing approximately $231,000.
                        The 16 faculty researchers involved represent seven academic departments in five colleges,
                        schools and centers across the University. They include the Herff College of Engineering,
                        the College of Arts & Sciences, the Fogelman College of Business & Economics, the
                        Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research (SBBER) and the Center for Earthquake
                        Research and Information (CERI).
                     
                     
                     The awards address a broad scope of emerging biologistics topics such as biologistics
                        analytics, disaster management of freight, biologistics security, healthcare/pharmaceutical
                        logistics and biologistics materials handling. Some of the projects being supported
                        include:

                           New Cutting-Edge Research Agenda;
                        
                        
                        Post-Disaster Management of Freight Transportation Networks;
                        
                        Biologistics Security: Implications for Market Growth, Transportation and Logistics;
                        
                        Big Data Analytics Meets the Internet of Things: A Paradigm Shift in Biologistics;

                     Under the program, research leaders are encouraged to collaborate with junior faculty
                        and graduate students in an effort to position the University as the national focal
                        point for biologistics research excellence. Dr. Stephanie Ivey, director of the Intermodal
                        Freight Transportation Institute, said, "Biologistics is fast emerging as a key area
                        of growth in the freight and transportation sector internationally, and we must stay
                        at the forefront of industry developments through pragmatic applied research."
                     
                     
                     Dr. Jasbir Dhaliwal, chief innovation officer and executive director of the FedEx
                        Institute of Technology, added, "Our duty is to think long-term and take the lead
                        in the development of emerging new research areas of the future. Our goals go beyond
                        supporting the efforts of our regional partners in biologistics economic development
                        to also becoming the national research center for the development of integrative biologistics
                        frameworks. Soon we will be the first university in the country to have 16 faculty
                        members working collaboratively to move biologistics forward, both as an industry
                        sector and a theoretical discipline."
                     
                     
                     The 16 researchers will receive their awards Jan. 22 at 3:30 p.m. at an open Biologistics
                        Lightning Talks event at the FedEx Institute of Technology. Project leaders will present
                        short summaries of their research ideas to the campus, community stakeholders and
                        the general public. During this event they will also be named Biologistics Research
                        Fellows of the University. This event is free and open to the public.
