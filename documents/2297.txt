                     Training is organized around the scientist-practitioner model of critical thinking
                        and program faculty strive for an equivalent emphasis on developing both clinical
                        understanding and skills and facility with research.Â  The program emphasizes responsibility
                        and commitment to human welfare. Didactic and experiential activities and coursework
                        are designed to anchor students firmly within the discipline of psychology. The department
                        has a strong commitment to training professionals to work with diverse populations
                        in urban settings.

                        students with opportunities to gain experience with the research process, present
                        at conferences, and publish. Current teams are studying GLBT issues, international

                        issues, wellness, animal-assisted therapy, and masculinity.
