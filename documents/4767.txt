		Dear Colleagues,
Information Technology Services (ITS) is improving the quality of customer service with the development and implementation of our new Service Catalog. This catalog is designed to inform, educate and enhance your experience about the different services we offer. On the Service Catalog website, you will find hundreds of applications and services organized into 13 categories:

Accounts and Access
Classroom and Computer Lab Support
Computer, Peripherals, and Hardware
Email and Collaboration
General Questions
Network, and Wifi Connectivity
Phones, Voicemail and CATV
Research Computing
Security and Safe Computing
Servers, Storage and Data
Software and Applications
Teaching and Learning
Website Access and Support

As you browse the catalog you will find information describing each service, who may request or is eligible for the service, how to request the service and what information is needed to fulfill the request. We invite you to view the catalog at:  http://www.memphis.edu/umtech/service_catalog/index.php .
Questions regarding the service catalog may be directed to the Service Desk by calling 901.678.8888, emailing umtech@memphis.edu, or by logging into the service desk system and submitting a request at https://umhelpdesk.memphis.edu .

		ITS Strategic Planning

				
			Posted by  Bambi Lange		
			
    
    

		
		Each spring, Information Technology Systems (ITS) collects feedback from students, staff and faculty using the Techqual survey. This year that feedback will be supplemented by a review of our organizational effectiveness, and the results from both efforts will support this year’s strategic planning effort. Ben Bryant has agreed to assist with our review of organizational effectiveness.
 
Mr. Bryant, a founder of SCB Computer Technology in 1976, has over 40 years of experience in the IT industry and has a long history of supporting the University. He holds BBA and MS degrees from the UofM and has served on the UofM Board of Visitors since 1997. He was appointed Executive in Residence at the FedEx Institute of Technology in 2010 and continues to serve the University as Executive in Residence at the Crews Center for Entrepreneurship.
 
As part of this engagement, Mr. Bryant will confer with individuals throughout ITS and the University. We anticipate the review will be completed by June, 2016 and recommendations will be reviewed to identify opportunities that can be leveraged to increase operational efficiencies and effectiveness within ITS. Mr. Bryant can be reached at 901.678.1597.
 
Meetings with Ben Bryant will be coordinated as needed during the coming weeks. Please contact me with any questions about this process.
Regards,
Robert
