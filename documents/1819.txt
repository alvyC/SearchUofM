                     University of Memphis, ALSAC to Open Donor Contact Center for St. Jude Children's
                        Research Hospital
                     
                     
                     April 11, 2016- The University of Memphis and ALSAC, the fundraising and awareness
                        organization for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, have formed a new partnership
                        designed to benefit the Memphis community that includes a donor contact center in
                        the Billy Mac Jones Building at 633 Normal St.
                     
                     
                     The center will be staffed by UofM student interns who will call potential and current
                        donors of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as part of ALSAC's donor engagement
                        program.
                     
                     
                     "We are excited about the partnership with the University of Memphis as it presents
                        a great opportunity to engage in meaningful community collaboration with incredible
                        young people," said Richard Shadyac Jr., president and CEO of ALSAC, the fundraising
                        and awareness organization for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. "Ultimately,
                        we hope this arrangement provides valuable professional and philanthropic experience
                        for University students, and they will consider long-term career opportunities for
                        employment at ALSAC or St. Jude Children's Research Hospital after graduation and
                        continue to find ways to give back."
                     
                     
                     UofM President M. David Rudd said, "The donor contact center is a great example of
                        what can happen when the UofM partners with world leaders like St. Jude Children's
                        Research Hospital to create new internships for our students that offer opportunities
                        to develop critical skills for future success, and make our world better. We couldn't
                        be more proud than to work with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital." 
                     
                     
                     Since 1999, the UofM has supported St. Jude Children's Research Hospital through the
                        Up 'til Dawn collegiate fundraising program. Through a variety of fundraising activities,
                        its St. Jude Up 'til Dawn volunteers raised a record $283,000 through the program
                        this year – more than any student organization in ALSAC's history.
                     
                     
                     Some 20 to 30 student internships are expected to be created as a result of this partnership.
                     
                     About St. Jude Children's Research Hospital 
                     
                     St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is leading the way the world understands, treats
                        and defeats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. It is the only National
                        Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children.
                        Treatments invented at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival
                        rate from 20 percent to 80 percent since the hospital opened more than 50 years ago.
                        St. Jude is working to drive the overall survival rate for childhood cancer to 90
                        percent, and we won't stop until no child dies from cancer. St. Jude freely shares
                        the discoveries it makes, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists
                        worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands more children. Families never receive
                        a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food – because all a family
                        should worry about is helping their child live. Join the St. Jude mission by visiting  stjude.org , liking St. Jude on Facebook ( facebook.com/stjude ) and following us on Twitter ( @stjude ).
