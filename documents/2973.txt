                     The University of Memphis is basically a pedestrian campus with interior travel ways
                        and parking around the periphery of the campus. The campus is relatively level with
                        accessible travel ways throughout most of the campus. Most buildings are accessible
                        with the use of ramps, elevators, and accessible parking. All accessible entrances
                        are designated by the international access symbol and all other building entrances
                        are marked with directional signage to the nearest accessible entrance. Elevators
                        used for accessibility purposes are public elevators and do not require keys. The
                        University continually works toward its long range plan to improve campus accessibility
                     
                     
                     A railroad track runs through the campus on the South side separating the Recreation
                        and Fitness Building, South Hall, Newport Hall, the Athletic Office, the Alumni Center
                        and the Southern Parking Lot from the main part of the campus. There is currently
                        no accessible route across the railroad track, although construction of an accessible
                        pathway is set to begin soon. In addition, construction of a new Student Recreation
                        and Fitness Center will be combined with a pedestrian bridge across the railroad tracks.
                        Students with mobility impairments using this side of the campus may travel by personal
                        vehicle across the tracks or ride The Blue Line, which has several routes, including
                        one traveling to and from the main part of the campus to the southern part of the
                        campus.

                     As a result of the current construction on campus, pedestrian travel routes will be
                        fenced off and rerouted from time to time. Students who wish to be notified of such
                        alterations should provide their e-mail address to DRS so that notification can be
                        made as soon as the information is received from Physical Plant and Planning.
