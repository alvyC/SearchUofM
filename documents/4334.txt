                        land—some living there for more than 2 years. In addition, black residents who registered
                        to vote were blacklisted by whites from purchasing goods and services necessary to
                        survive day to day, such as milk, eggs, fuel, and even medical care.
                     
                     
                     Although these events took place over 50 years ago, we still face the same struggles
                        for human rights in the U.S. and around the globe. Tent cities seem to pop up whenever
                        less powerful populations are displaced by those with more economic, political, and
                        social means—either to grab the property of the displaced, or as a result of war migration,
                        racial or ethnic massacres, or other civic and political upheaval—including those
                        following natural disasters or economic downturn.
