                     For questions regarding financial aid please visit the Enrollment Services Center
                        (ESC) located at Wilder Tower 102 or email financialaid@memphis.edu . 
                     
                     
                     Summer Information
                     
                     If you plan to go abroad in the summer, you may be able to use financial aid as well.
                        If you receive aid during the academic year (i.e. Fall and Spring), the financial
                        aid office would have to consider what aid eligibility (ex. Pell Grant or Direct Loan)
                        you may have remaining for the summer. If you are interested in a study abroad program
                        for the summer, you should complete the Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA),
                        if you have not already applied for the academic year. For Federal Aid you will need
                        to complete a Summer Request Form with the Financial Aid Office, 103 Wilder Tower.
                        For Summer HOPE Lottery Scholarship you will need to fill out two forms with the Scholarship
                        Office, 201 Wilder Tower.
                     
                     
                     Things to Note
                     
                     One thing that you must keep in mind is that financial aid is disbursed according
                        to the UofM academic schedule and will not be issued early even if your semester at
                        your host school begins prior to the UofM semester. Financial aid does not come in
                        time to purchase plane tickets or to fund other trip preparation costs. You will need
                        to keep this in mind when creating your budget. In addition, if you are applying financial
                        aid to pay your program fees due to the University of Memphis, you must provide documentation
                        of aid prior to your invoice due date. Financial aid can only be used to pay host
                        institution fees abroad once it is disbursed and refunded into your checking account.
                        We cannot transmit these funds to your host university. All payments required to your
                        host institution (often housing and deposits), are your responsibility. You must plan
                        to meet all their deadlines, regardless of the release date of your financial aid.
