                        there was no salary increase given the significant strain on our budget; however,
                        we did increase the minimum hourly rate for our lowest paid employees to $10.10. We
                        have taken steps to balance our budget without creating budget deficits - making substantial
                        gains without program reductions, layoffs or related budget cuts. We have made great
                        progress given your hard work and dedication to efficiency and effectiveness at the
                        UofM, and for that, I thank you.
                     
                     
                     The steps we have taken this year will allow us to avoid creating a new structural
                        deficit, address concerns about adjunct pay and position us for meaningful merit pay
                        increases in the future. As you might be aware, adjunct pay at the University has
                        not increased in over three decades. We will be implementing a 40% increase in minimum
                        adjunct pay from $1500 for a three credit hour course to $2100. This increase will
                        be funded centrally and reflects the importance of our adjunct faculty to the University
                        mission, along with recognition that the pay has been disproportionately low for many
                        years.
                     
                     
                     We will also award a $750 bonus to faculty and staff members, payable in October to
                        all those with one year of service effective June 30, 2016. Academic Deans, Vice Presidents,
                        the Provost, and I have agreed to opt out of any bonus payments. Final approval from
                        the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) will be sought at their September meeting.
                     
                     
                     These steps are consistent with efforts to address areas of significant need (e.g.
                        adjunct pay) while remaining vigilant of budget constraints and efforts to make sure
                        our structural budget deficit does not re-emerge. As mentioned previously, it is our
                        belief that these steps will position us for merit pay increases in the future.
                     
                     
                     Thank you for your tireless efforts concerning the care and success of our students
                        and community. We are seeing evidence of progress on many fronts, and it is entirely
                        because of you.
