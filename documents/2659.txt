                     While a number of majors will prepare students for the study of law, Philosophy courses,
                        as well as the Philosophy major, offer excellent preparation for students interested
                        in a career in the legal profession. Students who wish to prepare for Law School should,
                        therefore, strongly consider a major in Philosophy. Alternatively, they may pursue
                        a major in another discipline with a minor in Philosophy. The University of Memphis
                        also offers a Minor in Legal Thought and Liberal Arts . In any case, students pursuing a career in law are well advised to supplement whatever
                        course of study they choose with a number of Philosophy courses (notably Critical Thinking and a number of logic courses such as Elementary Logic, Intermediate Logic , or Advanced Logic ). This is for two main reasons:
                     
                     
                     First, Philosophy provides training in analytic and logical thinking, which are essential
                        components of both the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and the practice of law.
                        The American Bar Association recommends that students looking to pursue a career in
                        law acquire the following skills:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Analytic and problem solving skills
                        
                        
                        Critical reading skills
                        
                        Writing skills
                        
                        Oral communication and listening abilities
                        
                        General research skills
                        
                        Task organization and management skills
                        
                        Public service and promotion of justice
                        
                     
                     
                     Students acquire many of these skills in Philosophy courses: they are trained to read
                        difficult texts, assess arguments, conduct research, develop arguments of their own,
                        and present them clearly in speech and writing. Moreover, Philosophy majors consistently
                        outperform other majors on the LSAT. 
                     
                     
                     They also have the highest scores on both the Verbal Reasoning and the Analytic Writing sections of the GRE. As a consequence,
                        it comes as no surprise that acceptance rates of Philosophy majors applying to Law
                        School are higher than those of applicants majoring in most other disciplines, including
                        Economics, Political Science, History, Psychology, and Business Management.
                     
                     
                     Second, many Philosophy courses explore contemporary legal, political, and moral issues
                        that are pertinent to legal professionals. For example, courses such as Philosophy of Law , Contemporary Moral Problems , Ethics , and Issues in Political Philosophy allow students to understand the philosophical background to issues that are of interest
                        to lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals. Courses such as Environmental Ethics or Business Ethics will benefit those who wish to pursue careers in environmental law or corporate law.
                        Students interested in legal concerns in the context of medicine and technology may
                        wish to take courses in Biomedical Ethics , Philosophy of Science , or Science, Technology, and Human Values . Philosophical issues relevant to criminal law are covered in Philosophy of Law as well as Nature, Mind, and Knowledge , and Philosophy of Mind .
