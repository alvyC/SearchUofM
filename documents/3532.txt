                     Program Admission Admission to the dual program will require separate admission to both the Cecil C.
                        Humphreys School of Law and the University of Memphis Department of Political Science.
                        However, for applicants to the joint program, the Political Science Department will
                        accept LSAT scores in lieu of the GRE. Students are admitted into each program separately;
                        completion of one degree is not contingent upon completion of both.
                     
                     
                     Program Requirements The MA degree program will accept up to 16 hours for courses taken at the law school.
                        The remaining hours toward the MA in Political Science must be taken in Political
                        Science. Students may take only law courses while completing the first year law curriculum.
