                     UofM Lambuth Campus Sets Record for Enrollment
                     
                     August 25, 2015 - The University of Memphis Lambuth Campus has broken a record for
                        enrollment. This fall, 913 students are taking classes at the Lambuth Campus, up about
                        11 percent from 829 last fall.
                     
                     
                     Enrollment at the Lambuth Campus has been growing steadily since the University of
                        Memphis acquired the former Lambuth University in 2011. Enrollment the first year
                        was 250. That number rose to 581 (a 132 percent increase) in fall 2012, and grew to
                        695 in fall 2013, a 20 percent jump.
                     
                     
                     "We are very pleased to have an increase," said Dr. Niles Reddick, vice provost of
                        the Lambuth Campus. "We believe our marketing and recruiting efforts are paying off.
                        We would still like to increase our out-of-state student population, and will be making
                        efforts at this in the upcoming year."
                     
                     
                     Students at the Lambuth Campus may take a wide range of classes, including accounting,
                        biology, communication, criminal justice, education, English, math, music, nursing
                        and psychology. They have the advantages of a large metropolitan university set in
                        a quiet residential neighborhood.
                     
                     
                     Next year the Lambuth Campus will add a program in Youth Services in the College of
                        Education as well as a RN-to-BSN program. "These programs will pay dividends as well
                        as meet community needs," said Reddick.
