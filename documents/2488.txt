                     Welcome to Memories of a Massacre: Memphis in 1866
                     
                     This project is designed to call public attention to an event that rattled Reconstruction-era
                           Memphis in May 1866. The first large-scale racial massacre to erupt in the post-Civil
                           War South, the massacre in Memphis played a key role in prompting Congress to enact
                           sweeping changes to federal policies and to constitutional law. It also lent a new
                           urgency to an ongoing national debate about the meaning of freedom and the rights
                           of citizens. It was a massacre of historic proportions, one that helped lay the ground
                           for who we are today as a nation.
                     
                     Yet despite the historical importance of the Memphis Massacre, and indeed, the importance
                           of Reconstruction's history to our national identity, it is an almost wholly untold
                           story: devoid of the plethora of monuments, museums, and battlefield parks that make
                           the Civil War one of the most familiar features on our historical landscape. This
                           is about to change. In partnership with the National Park Service, the Tennessee Civil
                           War National Heritage Area, Humanities Tennessee, the University of Memphis, and many
                           other community and academic partners, our goal is to break this long-standing silence,
                           and to launch an enduring conversation about the Memphis Massacre, its legacies, and
                           its meanings, both past and present.
                     
                     We will be performing this feat of historic unveiling through a series of public lectures,

                           develops, we will be providing suggestions for further reading and primary sources,
                           as well as materials for teachers to use in their classrooms.
