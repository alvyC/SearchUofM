                        for Outstanding Mentoring in the Department of Journalism. The award honors distinguished
                        alumnus D. Mike Pennington, Class of 1972, and is the first mentoring award in the
                        College of Communication and Fine Arts and the first faculty award in Journalism.
                        The Pennington family and friends created the unique tribute to Pennington to honor
                        his dedication to helping others and his loyalty to his alma mater.
                     
                     
                     Honored with numerous awards during his lifetime, Pennington spent 25 years in corporate

                        Maxion Wheels and Cummins Filtration. Highly respected in his field, Pennington devoted

                        Act 1 (the Allied Committee for the Trucking Industry), Trucker Buddy International,
                        the Truck Writers of North America, and numerous industry projects for Heavy Duty

                     The D. Mike Pennington Award for Outstanding Mentoring will annually recognize a Journalism
