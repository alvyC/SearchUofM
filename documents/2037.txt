                     Legal Studies
                     
                     In the Legal Studies Program, students acquire the knowledge and skills required to
                        provide substantive legal services under the supervision of an attorney. Only licensed
                        attorneys are permitted to practice law.Â  However, they maximize efficiency and productivity
                        by adding qualified paralegals and legal assistants to their support staff.Â  Not only
                        are paralegals integral to law firms, but their unique skill sets are becoming increasingly
                        vital to corporations, government agencies, state and federal courts, law enforcement,
                        health care organizations, non-profits, educational institutions, and a wide range
                        of other professional settings.
                     
                     
                     The program offers a Bachelor of Professional Studies degree (BPS) with a concentration
                        in Legal Studies. The core curriculum emphasizes four correlated disciplines: (1)Â theory,
                        process, application, and ethics of law; (2)Â research and investigation; (3)Â law-related
                        technologies, and (4)Â professional decorum and communication skills.Â  The program
                        is designed to equip students for employment as essential support staff for licensed
                        attorneys.Â  It is also provides an excellent academic foundation for students aspiring
                        to later attend law school.

                     Experiential Learning Credit
                     
                     Students may be granted credit for college-level knowledge related to their major
                        area of study that they have gained from work experience, life experience, or non-college
                        instruction. Students who would like an assessment of such learning must prepare a
                        portfolio that describes and documents their learning experience. Portfolios are assessed
                        by faculty who teach in the studentsâ field of study.
                     
                     
                     Assessment by Portfolio is reserved for knowledge and competencies that do not readily
                        fit into the Credit by Examination procedures. For more information please visit the
