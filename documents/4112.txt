                           (transportation) either late on Sunday (depending on the graduating students college
                           or school) or Monday morning following Commencement. Please share the spring possible
                           back up date information with all guests (immediate and extended family and friends).

                     SPRING COMMencement and the nba grizzlies 
                     
                     The University of Memphis hosts Commencement at the FedExForum, the only indoor facility
                           in the city big enough to permit unlimited guests for all of our graduates. The FedExForum
                           is home to the Memphis Grizzlies. All events other than games of the Grizzlies can
                           be cancelled should the team need the facility.
                     
                     If the Grizzlies have a spectacular season like last season in future seasons and
                        make the post-season playoffs, the Spring Commencement date MAY be affected. This
                        would be a result of the National Basketball Association determining the Grizzlies
                        would host a home-playoff game on the same day as graduation. This in mind, the University
                        of Memphis has worked with the FedExForum to determine the Spring Commencement date
                        and an alternate date in the case of a home playoff game. We hope your schedules will
                        be clear for both dates! Please speak to your guests, family and friends to plan their
                        schedules accordingly to avoid missing your momentous and historic event-graduation
                        day! We look forward to having you join us to celebrate your graduation day!
                     
                     
                     Please note - if you are graduating in May of any year, please have your guests plan
                        for the weekend of graduation (both Saturday and Sunday) to avoid missing this historical
                        event in your life!
                     
                     
                     Frequently Asked Questions and Notes: Concerning the May Possible Date Change
                     
                     
                        
                        Why don't we move to another venue ?
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     This May, the UofM will confer 2,285 degrees for our students. Our students bring
                        enough guests to nearly fill the FedExForum – 19,000 seats! In comparison, the Cannon
                        Center seats 3,000. We have actively explored other options and unfortunately, there
                        are no other suitable venues for our spring ceremonies.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Couldn't we have Commencement the same day as a game ?
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     This option has been explored. This is not possible because TV has to lad in and there
                        are shootarounds, game presentation, rehearsals and several other things not including
                        the flooring, etc. Morever, graduates are seated on the court floor, which requires
                        time for set up and clean up after both ceremonies. An additional significant issue
                        is filling and emptying the Forum and parking garages after each ceremony. It isn't
                        easy to quickly move 20,000 people and their vehicles!
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        What if the Grizzlies end up playing during Commencement weekend at the FedExForum ?
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     NBA Playoff games are not scheduled back-to-back, so if the Grizzlies play on our
                        original Saturday, they will more than likely NOT play on Sunday.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Why doesn't the UofM Commencement get precedence over the Grizzlies game ?
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     The FedExForum was built for and is operated by the Memphis Grizzlies franchise. The
                        UofM rents the facility on an as-needed basis. Grizzlies games are scheduled by the
                        NBA and always take precedence over other activities. 
                     
                     
                     The NBA determines the play off and play schedule for the NBA Playoff Teams. They
                        tell the Forum when and what date games are played, and it is not movable.
                     
                     
                     You are allowed to walk at a later date, if you are certified for the spring term,
                        and unable to participate due to the possible date change. Please contact commencement@memphis.edu
                        for details.
