                     Certain University collateral material is required to carry a production code and an affirmative action statement. The production
                        code consists of a series of numerals and letters denoting that the piece is a University
                        of Memphis project, and that project's number, the quantity of pieces printed and
                        the identity of the printer. The preferred placement of this code is .125" to .25"
                        from the bottom right edge of the back cover, and it should be typeset in 5 point
                        Formata Bold Condensed.
