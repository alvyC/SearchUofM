                     Online Resource Ranks UofM Among Best Online Colleges
                     
                     October 2, 2015 - AffordableCollegsOnline.org has included the University of Memphis
                        in its 2015-2016 list of Best Online Colleges. The resource for online education and
                        college affordability information ranks the UofM No. 19 on the list.
                     
                     
                     According to a 2014 Learning House survey, nearly 90 percent of online students report
                        that online classes are equal to or better than classroom study. One-third say they
                        had not considered classroom or hybrid programs.
                     
                     
                     "The University of Memphis is very excited about being ranked among the best online
                        colleges," said Roy Bowery, director of Distance Learning. "Since launching our first
                        online master's program in 1995, we now offer 64 fully web-based UofM online programs.
                        Most of our online programs may be completed without visiting the campus, in partial
                        or full-semester classes, and with live professors. For the fall 2015 semester, we
                        have more than 6,300 students studying online, either partially or fully. Most of
                        our more than 500 online courses are developed and taught by the same UofM faculty
                        providing our on-ground programs, ensuring that both delivery formats meet the same
                        academic rigor. Such programs align with the University of Memphis' commitment to
                        provide our students with highly reputable degrees that are affordable, accessible
                        and accelerated."
