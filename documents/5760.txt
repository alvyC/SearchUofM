                     Curriculum offered in Jazz and Studio Music is designed to prepare students for a professional career performing, composing,
                        researching, or teaching in all fields of music. The division works closely with other
                        music faculty at the University of Memphis to offer students an inclusive music curriculum
                        that prepares them for the contemporary music field.

                        Brown, Bill Mobley, and Tony Reedus. Graduates of the University of Memphis hold teaching
                        and research positions at Pacific Lutheran University, the New Zealand School of Music,
                        Belmont University, Colgate University, University of Tennessee, Xavier University,

                     Jazz and Studio Music has a long and successful history at the University of Memphis.
                        Initiated by Dr. Tom Ferguson in the 1960s, the School of Music has developed one
                        of the most comprehensive programs in the United States, currently offering both undergraduate
                        and master's degrees in Jazz Performance and Composition/Arranging. Both music majors
                        and non-majors at the University of Memphis are strongly encouraged to participate
                        in the performing groups, classes, and applied lessons offered in the Jazz and Studio
                        Music curriculum.
