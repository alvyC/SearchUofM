                           About Dr. Sabel
                           
                           Dr. Sabel joined the Department in 2016. She began her research career as a developmental
                              geneticist examining genes involved in early embryonic development and then transitioned
                              her focus to teaching and research in science education. Her doctoral work focused
                              generally on adult learners engaging in learning life science and science teaching
                              methods, and specifically on inservice teachers learning to use formative assessment,
                              preservice teachers learning both life science content and pedagogical methods, and
                              undergraduate students learning biology. At the University of Memphis, Dr. Sabel's
                              work focuses on various types of tools and classroom environments that can support
                              students in learning biology and engaging in scientific practices. Dr. Sabel is an
                              active member of the National Association for Research in Science Teaching (NARST),
                              National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT), and the Society for the Advancement
                              of Biology Education Research (SABER).
