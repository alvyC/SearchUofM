                     Official Transcript
                     
                     We produce copies of your official transcript upon request. An official transcript contains both the University’s official seal
                        and the University Registrar’s signature. This is the document that is sent to current
                        or prospective employers or to other colleges, universities, or professional schools
                        you are applying or transferring to. You can request that an official transcript be
                        issued to you, but it will be stamped “Issued to Student.”
                     
                     
                     Unofficial Transcript
                     
                     The unofficial transcript is a web-based copy of your transcript that you can view/print after logging into
                        the myMemphis portal. It will contain only your UofM coursework and degrees from Fall
                        1988, forward. You must have an active portal account to view your unofficial transcript, so his option is temporarily unavailable to former
                        students.
