                     Tracing and controlling security and privacy issues in the cloud is challenging. Due
                     to the diversity in these issues, the number of cloud service forms, and the kinds
                     of cloud deployment models; cloud service providers have different offerings. This
                     tutorial explores a cloud security/privacy approach that is structured and expandable
                     to enable updating of emerging and obsolete solutions, while considering protection
                     and cost. This course also examines existing commercial security solutions such as
                     CloudPassage Halo , CipherCloud , and CloudLock , which are reported as having shortcomings, particularly in boundary defense, privileged
                     users, audits and incident response.

                     Technology users can be lazy, and this can be dangerous. Often they presume that the
                     security applications will protect them without their involvement. The weak link is
                     the IT User, not the applications they use. IT User education and training are one
                     of the major keys to security success. User apathy can run high and should be addressed. This
                     tutorial utilizes precepts of technology dependency theory to explore the degree to
                     which technology users over rely upon their security software and hardware deployments
                     to keep them safe, instead of engaging in safe computing practices.

                     IoT has evolved to indicate advanced connectivity of products, systems and services
                        that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications. How does cyber security fit into
                        this picture? This panel will explore how to protect connected products and applications
                        against viruses and hackers, how we should approach IoT, and how IoT will shape our
                        future.*

                     Panel 2: We Can Outsource Functionality, but We Cannot Outsource Risk
                     
                     More and more organizations are looking to outsource certain applications and functionality,
                        with much of it going to the cloud. Those organizations are still responsible for
                        the security and protection of the data that the customer provides, no matter where
                        it resides. With more breaches happening through third-party vendors, companies have
                        to find a way to vet the security of these vendors to make sure they are adequately
                        protecting their customer data from exposure.
