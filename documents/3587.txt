                        About Professor Kiel
                        
                        Professor Kiel's work centers on inequality in the education system, particularly
                           along lines of race. His research examines efforts to reduce educational disparities,
                           including both the historical era of desegregation and more modern efforts to reform
                           the structure of public education.
                        
                        
                        In 2011, Prof. Kiel built upon his work on school desegregation in Memphis through
                           an oral history project that culminated in The Memphis 13, a documentary film he wrote
                           and directed sharing the stories of the first students to desegregate public schools
                           in Memphis. The film premiered at the National Civil Rights Museum on the 50th anniversary
                           of that historic event and has been featured at film festivals, universities, and
                           museums across the country.
                        
                        
                        In addition to his scholarly writing listed below, Prof. Kiel has written op-eds for
                           the Washington Post, USA Today, and the Memphis Commercial Appeal and has given numerous
                           presentations on issues of race and education, both locally and nationally. During
                           the merger of school districts in Shelby County, Prof. Kiel was appointed to the Transition
                           Planning Commission charged with crafting a plan for that merger, and served as co-chairperson
                           of the group's Education Committee. For his work on schooling in Memphis, he has been
                           cited in The New York Times, The Atlantic, and Education Week and was awarded the
                           2013 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Human Rights Award by the University of Memphis.
                        
                        
                        In 2015, Prof. Kiel was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to undertake comparative research
                           on educational disparities in South Africa and was hosted during his months there
                           at the University of the Free State. Prior to entering teaching, Prof. Kiel worked
                           in private practice doing civil litigation at firms in Boston and Memphis. While in
                           practice, he also represented criminal defendants in post-conviction matters at both
                           the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals. Prof.
                           Kiel serves on the boards of Facing History and Ourselves and Just City, and was a
                           founding steering committee member of Common Ground Memphis. On campus, he serves
                           as a reviewer for the annual book award presented by the Benjamin Hooks Institute
                           of Social Change.
