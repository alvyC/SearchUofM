                     Renewals
                     
                     You may renew books from the stacks in person, by phone, or online as long as your
                        material is not overdue. Call the Checkout Desk for renewal options. If material is
                        returned late, fines accrue at $.25 a day for 30 days. After 30 days, there is a $7.50
                        late fee plus a non-refundable $10.00 processing fee for each item. If the material
                        is not returned, you will be charged the above fees, plus the cost of the material.
                        All material is subject to Recall after 14 days.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Online, via the My Library Account portal. UM faculty, staff, and students enter their username and password on the
                           left-hand side. All other users enter their last name and barcode on the right-hand
                           side. Renew by checking the boxes next to your items pushing the Renew button.
                        
                        
                        Over the phone by calling (901) 678-2205.  Please make sure you have the books with
                           you when you call. 
                        
                        
                        In person by bringing the books to the Check-Out Desk.  Please make sure you have
                           your UM ID with you.  
                        
                        
                        You may send a renewal request to our email address, lib_circrenewal@memphis.edu . Please make sure you include the titles and barcodes from the books. 
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     You may not renew overdue items over the phone or via email. You can bring them in and renew
                        at the Check Out desk, or you can renew them using My Library Account portal by yourself. If you renew using My Library Account portal and the material is overdue, the fine will be automatically reflected on your
                        library record.
                     
                     
                     You may renew items via the My Library Account portal twice. You may renew them in person as many times as you’d like as long as
                        there are no recalls or special requests for the item(s).
                     
                     
                     Returns
                     
                     Materials may be returned to Ned McWherter Library’s Check In Desk or to any one of
                        the branch libraries: Health Sciences Library or Music (Music Building, room 115). 
                        For your convenience, there are 3 book returns/book drops, one in front of McWherter
                        Library, one outside of Brister Hall on Alumni drive and one on Central Avenue in
                        front of the Music Building. To prevent damage or loss, CDs, Videos and DVDs should
                        not be placed in book returns, but returned to the Circulation department or to a
                        branch library.
