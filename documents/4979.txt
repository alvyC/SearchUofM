                     What are the advantages and the costs of learning more than one language in childhood?
                     
                     We study how children learn two languages simultaneously or how they learn a second
                        language, especially when they start school without any experience in the new language.
                        The work is conducted in various settings including schools in Memphis and in a collaborative
                        site in Mexico.
                     
                     
                     A key question is how fast do children acquire a second language and what effect does
                        the learning have on the first language? In many cases children appear to lose native
                        command of the first language surprisingly rapidly. Other important questions concern
                        optimal procedures of education to support oral language as well as literacy. Of particular
                        interest to us is the role of phonological learning in both languages of a bilingual
                        child in terms of effect on reading acquisition. Intervention to support phonological
                        awareness in both languages is an additional focus for our literacy efforts.
