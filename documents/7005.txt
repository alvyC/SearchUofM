                     General Chemistry I Laboratory--CHEM 1111
                     
                     This course is required for Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, and Dietetics majors,
                        and will also be taken by students preparing for medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and
                        related health professions. CHEM 1110 and 1111 together (4 credit hours) satisfy a
                        General Education Natural Science requirement.
                     
                     
                     NOTE: Students with an AP score of 4 or 5 may obtain credit for CHEM 1110 and 1111.
                     
                     Corequisite or Prerequisite: Students are strongly encouraged to enroll concurrently in the associated lecture,
                        CHEM 1110 , but CHEM 1111 may also be taken after completing CHEM 1110 with a grade of C- or
                        better.  [Students whose high school chemistry background is weak are advised to take
                        CHEM 1010 before taking CHEM 1110 and 1111.  Please note: Separate grades are assigned for
                        lecture (1110) and laboratory (1111).] Corequisite or Prerequisite:   ALEKS Math placement score placing in MATH 1830 or higher or completion of MATH
                        1710, 1720, 1730 or higher with a grade of C- or better.
