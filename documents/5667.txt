                     Crews Center for Entrepreneurship's Seed Fund Invests in Innovative Thinking
                     
                     August 19, 2015 - The University of Memphis' Crews Center for Entrepreneurship has
                           launched the Crews Center Catalyst (C3) Seed Fund. The fund will incentivize individual
                           student and faculty entrepreneurs to form startup teams for the commercialization
                           of ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities.
                     
                     "The UofM is committed to encouraging innovative and creative thinking," said Dr.
                        Jasbir Dhaliwal, the UofM's chief innovation officer. "And the Crews Center is the
                        University's hub for turning ideas into the foundation for successful startup companies."
                     
                     
                     John Bobango (JD '83), chair of the Crews Center advisory council, added, "Establishing
                        the C3 Seed Fund was the natural next step for the Crews Center. We have an outstanding
                        facility that is the nerve center for entrepreneurship on campus. This fund will take
                        entrepreneurship activity at the UofM to another level."
                     
                     
                     In addition to receiving funding, entrepreneurs will be assigned a mentor and have
                        access to the staff and resources of the Crews Center. Mike Hoffmeyer, director of
                        the Crews Center, said, "The goals for the C3 seed fund are to increase engagement
                        of students and faculty in entrepreneurial activities, and to increase the number
                        of UofM startups teams that are pursuing commercialization projects. We are committed
                        to providing the support the entrepreneurs need to keep their ventures on track."
                     
                     
                     Plans will be accepted and reviewed by the selection committee on a rolling basis.
                        Awards of up to $3,000 or more will be made to individuals or teams that include at
                        least one current UofM student or faculty member. The size of the awards will vary
                        based on whether the proposed project is an idea that needs further research or a
                        developed business model that has already been vetted.
                     
                     
                     The Crews Center for Entrepreneurship was established in 2011 through an initial investment
                        by Harriett and Hilliard Crews. The Center encourages and supports a culture of entrepreneurship
                        at the UofM, helping faculty and student entrepreneurs as they focus their passion
                        and commercialize their ideas, research and inventions into the foundations of successful
                        companies.
