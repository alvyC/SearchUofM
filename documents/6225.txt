                        Dr. James Jamison (June 9, 1943 - November 28, 2014)
                        
                        
                        It is with great sadness that the Department of Mathematical Sciences announces that
                           
                           Professor James Jamison  passed away on November 28, 2014. With strong determination
                           and resilience he fought a very difficult and heroic fight against cancer that lasted
                           for more than fifteen years. Nevertheless, during those years, he has continued a
                           very active and productive professional life both as a beloved and sought-after teacher
                           and mentor and a highly recognized and respected researcher in operator theory and
                           functional analysis; while greatly contributing as Chair of the department to its
                           notable advancement both within the university as well as at the national level. A
                           member of the department since 1970, he has left an enduring and most valuable print
                           on its development and its professional standing. He has continued to work on his
                           research, teaching, advising while maintaining a regular professional schedule up
                           to the very last days of his life. He will be sorely missed by his colleagues, friends
                           and students. A memorial services was held on Saturday, December 6, at Grace-St Luke's
                           Episcopal Church, 1270 Peabody Ave. Memphis. TN.
