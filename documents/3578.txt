                        About Professor Bock
                        
                        Using empirical techniques and theoretical models, Prof. Bock studies the legal, organizational,
                           and behavioral considerations that underlie the various dysfunctional, inefficient,
                           or otherwise socially-undesirable aspects of patent litigation. His research often
                           takes an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on lessons from behavioral economics,
                           cognitive psychology, and management science.
