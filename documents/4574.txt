		Faculty and Staff:
We have received our latest performance funding data from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), and we continue to make progress. With respect to outcomes, the most critical data points revolve around completion metrics, including the number of those graduating (both undergraduate and graduate), degrees per full time equivalent (FTE) and graduation rate. From 2012-13 to 2015-2016, total bachelor degrees awarded increased from 2,887 to 3,038 (5% increase). Our master and doctoral degrees have been fairly steady, fluctuating between 900-1000 master degrees per year and 260 doctoral degrees. Our degrees per FTE, which is an overall efficiency measure, increased from 20.0 to 22.8 (a 14% increase in efficiency). Over the last two years our graduation rate has hovered around 49%, but it has slipped slightly to 47.2% for the 2015-2016 six-year cohort, a trend that was consistent with all of our TBR university partners. Despite the increase in overall graduation numbers, this hints at an underlying retention problem that has persisted for decades and one that we are targeting with a clear and well-coordinated strategy. It also suggests that our efforts targeting completion for students previously disengaged (and well beyond the six-year graduation window) have been successful. ]]>

Similarly, our quality indicators were very positive for the past academic year. Our score summary is provided below. As you can see from the description of quality assurance funding, the assessment is geared toward incentivizing meritorious performance. Two years ago our score was 87, compared to 90 last year and this year’s score of 92. As you know, we all strive for excellence, and this is evidence of significant and steady progress toward that goal. All indicators show that we are making progress across multiple fronts, and most importantly, we are providing a high quality and comprehensive educational experience for our students.
Thank you for your hard work, your commitment to our students and serving our community so well.
Warm Regards,
M. David Rudd
President | Distinguished University Professor

		Press Release October 12, 2016 – Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam today announced the eight appointees to the newly created University of Memphis governing board, giving the University increased autonomy to support student success as the state continues its Drive to 55 initiative.
“This is a landmark day for the University of Memphis, our city and West Tennessee,” said UofM President M. David Rudd. “The appointment of our new Board of Trustees and related change in our governance structure will better position the UofM to grow and compete at the national level, with an unparalleled commitment to innovation, efficiency and effectiveness. I would like to thank our new Trustees for their willingness to serve our University and broader Memphis community. We aspire to join the top tier of research universities nationally and look forward to working with this very talented group to realize that goal. ]]>

“We are grateful for Governor Haslam’s vision for the future of higher education in Tennessee and the support of our state legislators. Without their commitment to excellence in higher education, this remarkable opportunity would not be possible.”
The University of Memphis Board of Trustees is one of six to be appointed by Gov. Haslam, a result of his FOCUS Act passed by the General Assembly earlier this year.
The appointees to the UofM Board of Trustees are:

Douglas Edwards, senior advisor at BBH Capital Partners and former CEO of Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.
Marvin Ellison, CEO and board chairman of JCPenney Company, Inc.
Alan Graf, executive vice president and chief financial officer for FedEx Corp.
Cato Johnson, senior vice president of public policy and regulatory affairs for Methodist Healthcare
Brad Martin, former interim president of the University of Memphis and retired chairman and CEO of Saks, Inc.
David North, president and CEO for Sedgwick Claims Management Services
Carol Roberts, senior vice president and chief financial officer for International Paper Co.
Susan Springfield, executive vice president and chief credit officer for First Horizon National Corporation

Subject to confirmation by the General Assembly, the Board of Trustees appointments are effective Jan. 16, 2017. If confirmed, Board members will undergo orientation and professional development coordinated by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission. The University of Memphis Board of Trustees will assume responsibility upon the first called meeting by Gov. Haslam.

		Dear Campus Community:
The University of Memphis is dedicated to helping students, faculty and staff create a vibrant, welcoming, inclusive and safe environment. As you may be aware, there was an incident last week in which a student found her car vandalized and a racist note was left on her windshield. We immediately reached out to the student involved, along with her family. The incident has been vigorously investigated, but we have been unable to identify the perpetrator. We will continue to investigate the incident and will respond accordingly. Racism, bigotry and hate speech, in any form or fashion, will not be tolerated on our campus. ]]>
				Dear Campus Community:
The University of Memphis is dedicated to helping students, faculty and staff create a vibrant, welcoming, inclusive and safe environment. As you may be aware, there was an incident last week in which a student found her car vandalized and a racist note was left on her windshield. We immediately reached out to the student involved, along with her family. The incident has been vigorously investigated, but we have been unable to identify the perpetrator. We will continue to investigate the incident and will respond accordingly. Racism, bigotry and hate speech, in any form or fashion, will not be tolerated on our campus.
This is an important moment in our nation’s history. Issues of race, free speech and social justice have been at the forefront. We were proud of our campus’ response to two visitors espousing controversial ideas and opinions a few weeks ago. There is a difference, though, between free speech and hate speech meant to demean and humiliate. As was noted in a communication last year, at the heart of our mission is a commitment to providing a high-quality comprehensive education for our students, and doing so in a safe environment but also an environment that challenges our students to explore a diverse range of ideas and beliefs, and to grow and develop as individuals. An exceptional educational experience is one that challenges ideas and encourages creativity, not one that insulates students from the diversity that is our city and nation. Diversity enriches all of our lives. Universities are about ideas, some of which will push traditional boundaries and challenge the status quo. A vibrant university community embraces this reality. It does not seek to silence debate and discussion; rather, it encourages and nurtures it. Similarly though, a vibrant university community does not tolerate racism, bigotry and hate speech meant to demean, humiliate and degrade. This most recent incident was intended to do just that. We will respond to incidents like the one last week in quick and decisive fashion, recognizing that we need to investigate and fully understand the situation first.
The last few weeks have raised important issues for our campus. One incident was clear in its intent and purpose, the other more nuanced and complex. Consistent with our mission, our next  Critical Conversation campus-wide discussion   will address this very issue, and we invite you to participate – details about this Critical Conversation event will follow. We also have a University  Town Hall  meeting scheduled for next week, Thursday, October 13 at 3:00 p.m. in the University Center Theatre. Please join us.
We will always strive to create a vibrant and safe environment for our entire campus community. Sometimes the issues raised will be clear, sometimes more subtle, provocative and difficult. As an engaged community, we will always be up to the challenge.
Warm Regards,
M. David Rudd, President|Distinguished University Professor
Karen Weddle-West, Provost|Director of Diversity Initiatives

		Dear Campus Community:
As you may be aware, two men have been on campus for the last two days espousing their views and opinions on a host of issues. As a public university, we are following state and university free speech and public access policies. We will be exploring several things in the coming weeks – an understanding of when such public access becomes disruptive to our campus and learning community and the boundary between opinion and hate speech. I am requesting that we include this topic in one of our upcoming Critical Conversations. Although complex, these are important issues for our campus and broader society. ]]>

Finally, I want to say thank you to our entire campus, including students, faculty and staff for your patience, tolerance and recognition of the importance of free speech in a democratic society. As noted above, we will be discussing, as a campus, the boundaries around disruption of our learning environment, along with the issue of hate speech. I also would like to thank our police officers for their patient and appropriate efforts to safeguard not only our community members but those offering controversial views on our campus. These are precisely the kinds of issues to be discussed and debated in the life of a vibrant university, sometimes passionately.

		Dear Campus Community:
As promised, I am providing an update on our final enrollment numbers for the fall semester. Below is a copy of our total enrollment as of today, along with 2016 and 2015 comparisons. As you can see, our total headcount is 21,521 (3.3% up over 2015) and our total credit hours are 2452,550 (up 3.8% over 2015). A few numbers that are not reflected in the table include our new freshman class of 2,670 compared to 2,050 in 2015 (growth of 30.2%). Additionally, the UofM enrolled a total of 4,863 new students (freshman and transfers), the largest number in at least a decade and up 23% over last year. Of particular importance, our Honors College continues to be the largest in the state of Tennessee with over 500 new freshman joining their ranks this year. Not only have we grown, but we have been able to do so by maintaining our commitment to recruiting quality students. This year’s average ACT is 22 and the average high school GPA is 3.4, both identical to those over the past five years. The impressiveness of this year’s growth is magnified by the previously mentioned fact that we have graduated record numbers of students over the past three years. ]]>

Our efforts to advance the Tax Incremental Financing (TIF) in the University Neighborhood Districts will only help solidify efforts to enhance the residential and community environment at the UofM. We are optimistic about support, both among our county commissioners and city council members. There are good days ahead for our University. Thank you for your hard work and continued commitment to our students and community.

Warm Regards,

		Dear Campus Community:
Below you will find a copy of the 3rd day enrollment numbers for the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) schools. As you can see, only two institutions are growing, Austin Peay State University and the UofM. As mentioned in a previous communication, our overall growth is about 3%. Growth in our Graduate School is a remarkable 4.7%. Both numbers are particularly impressive when you look at state trends. What is not apparent in the numbers below is that, as of today, our freshman class is at 2,747 compared to 2,013 last year, a stunning growth rate of 36%. It is also important to note that last year’s comparison numbers include 456 dual enrollment students. Dual enrollment numbers have yet to be entered. We have a total of 1,132 dual enrollment students to enter compared to 780 for last year, growth of 45%. In coming years, we will be disaggregating dual enrollment students from our total numbers. ]]>

This positive trajectory is likely the result of several factors including our 250-mile radius tuition reduction program, more effective marketing and, most importantly, your hard work. The work of each and every member of our campus community has an impact on recruitment, enrollment, retention and completion. Thank you for your dedication!

A public presentation was made today to the Shelby County Commissioners Economic Development Committee. We will be presenting to the Memphis City Council in the coming weeks.
As you can see from the presentation slides:  http://www.memphis.edu/presweb/communications/undc_tif_presentation.pdf , the purpose of the TIF is to “improve the area surrounding the University of Memphis and promote student safety, walkability and to fully engage students in community life and retain talent in Memphis”. Also as detailed, the TIF will provide for over $21 million to be invested over the next twenty years, all supporting the University District neighborhood.
This is an extremely important and wonderful step for the University of Memphis and the UNDC. Given these presentations and related discussion are public, I wanted to make sure you had accurate details. We will keep you updated as we move through the approval process.
Warm Regards,

		Dear Campus Community:
Welcome back! I hope the summer months were enjoyable and productive. As we move into a new academic year, I am pleased to share some good news. For the first time in a number of years, our University will be growing. Although final numbers are not official until the 14th class day, it is estimated that we will grow somewhere between 2-3% overall. Last year we established annual growth targets of 2%, and it appears that we will exceed that for the 2016-2017 academic year. This year’s freshman class will likely set a record. Last Friday we had over 2,700 new freshman enrolled, an increase of 30% over last year’s class. As students settle in during the first week, we expect the final number to be somewhere between 25% -30% year over year growth, a record for the University of Memphis. Similarly, growth in total new students (i.e. transfers + freshman) will approach 4000, the largest we have seen in quite a while. As of today, the growth in total new students is 24% over last year. Overall growth of 2-3% is particularly impressive given our significant improvement in graduation numbers over the past three years. As shared previously, we graduated over 800 students more in the past three years relative to the previous three year average, with marked improvement in our overall graduation rate. Of particular importance, our new incoming students are the most academically qualified to date, both with respect to mean ACT scores and high school GPA. ]]>

		Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:
Last week representatives from the University of Memphis met with Mayor Strickland and other city officials to explore how our University might help in response to recent national events and the tragic loss of life.

				Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:
Last week representatives from the University of Memphis met with Mayor Strickland and other city officials to explore how our University might help in response to recent national events and the tragic loss of life. An issue that emerged with great clarity was the need for an enduring, coordinated effort, one that recognizes the longstanding nature of many of the issues and concerns raised.
As a first step, we have decided to establish a University of Memphis Diversity Council to help direct this effort. The Council will work in coordination with Linda Hall and the Office of Multicultural Affairs, Daphene McFerren and the Benjamin Hooks Institute for Social Change, the Critical Conversations Committee and our President’s Leadership Council. In the coming weeks, we will be reaching out to faculty, staff, students, alumni and community leaders to join the discussion. The Council will provide for broad-based input, allowing a voice across all University constituents. We look forward to supporting the City of Memphis as we move forward.
As mentioned in previous communications, we are strengthened and unified by our diversity. Although our local and national challenges are significant, we have tremendous talent on our campus and look forward to helping move our University and city forward.
Regards,
M. David Rudd

		Dear Campus Community:
The deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, followed by the loss of the officers in Dallas, have shaken us all. In the midst of this troubling time many of you – students, faculty and staff – have contacted me asking to be part of a broader campus response.

Along with our Office of Multicultural Affairs, I am reaching out in the coming days to explore how best for us to respond, how best we can facilitate healing, how best for us to be part of the solution to such senseless violence.
In times of great despair, I am always encouraged by the caring and compassion expressed on our campus. This past month I was reminded of a core value for our campus, city and nation, that we are unified and strengthened by our diversity. During this period of great pain, let’s rely on one another to chart a path forward, respond with unity and decisiveness that we are, and will be, a part of the solution.
Please know that services are available for anyone that needs support and assistance. The Counseling Center is ready to help our campus. The Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Dean of Students Office are also open for anyone who wants to talk or just needs a place to be with others. If you need to talk with me, don’t hesitate to reach out. Our leadership team is ready to offer support and assistance during this difficult time.
