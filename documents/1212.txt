	   About Our Organization
The Student Ambassador Board is a group of highly motivated and dedicated students that help host Alumni
Association and Presidential events. It is the liaison between the administration,
alumni, current student body, prospective students and the Memphis community. We are pleased to announce the formation of a Student Ambassador Board at the UofM Lambuth campus as well!

Additionally, the group hosts events to raise funds for the J. Wayne Johnson Scholarship, awarded each Spring to outstanding seniors. These events include the Blue Lantern Tour and one of the University’s longest standing traditions, Mudball. Members meet monthly and play an active roll in each Commencement ceremony.


Apply to be on the Board!
Interested in joining SAB?   Contact a.mizell@memphis.edu  or 901.678.3119.


J. Wayne Johnson Scholarship
The application deadline for the 2016-2017 J. Wayne Johnson Scholarship has passed. Next application opens: December 2016. 

Full-time undergraduate students who are classified as juniors or seniors, OR graduating
seniors who are attending graduate school at UofM with a 2.75 overall GPA are eligible.
The number of deserving and qualified applicants will determine the amount. To be
nominated, a student must receive an endorsement by one of the chartered campus organizations
president or advisor. 


Make a Gift to SAB
The Student Ambassador Board is currently reaching out to all SAB members both past
and present. We are seeking donations from our SAB family that will afford our students
the best possible experience and training. While the Student Ambassador Board receives
funding from the University, there are additional needs, costs, and projects that
SAB would like to include in their future programming. Gifts from our SAB family are
vital to cover these costs. Your gift will help to train and develop professionally
all of our student ambassadors.
