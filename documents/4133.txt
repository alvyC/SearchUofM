                     Why doesn't my ID work when scanned at the Recreation Center? 
                     
                     Reasons could include:
                     
                     Your ID is expired or you're no longer a member. Student fees need to be paid. You
                        have a Household Membership but your child is now over 21 years old. You are a faculty
                        or staff member with no membership (faculty/staff can use the facility without membership
                        by paying $5 per visit with valid ID; identify your status at the entry). You're a
                        part-time (less than 6 hrs) student (P/T students pay $3 per visit at the Recreation
                        Center; identify yourself as part-time at the entry. You have a University Guest ID
                        card. You don't have recreation privileges. You are a current Southwest student or
                        IEI student. You need to pay Activity Fees at the Bursar's Office to access the Recreation
                        Center. You're a UofM faculty or staff and going to class as a UM student at the University.
                        You may have dual status. Faculty/staff status has priority over student status, causing
                        the ID to not scan correctly. Identify yourself as dual status at the entry and talk
                        to supervisor to gain access.
                     
                     
                     How many guests may I bring?
                     
                     You can only bring one guest per valid UofM ID. You must sign for them at the front
                        entry. You are liable for their actions and must stay with them throughout your visit.
                        You could lose recreation privilege if this rule is violated.
                     
                     
                     Do I need my ID to go to class in the Recreation Center?
                     
                     Yes, the first time you forget your ID, you will be asked to sign in and be escorted
                        to your instructor. The next time you forget your ID, we charge a fee of $5.
                     
                     
                     Help! I lost my ID!
                     
                     Items found are kept for 24 hours, then logged in and sent to the Bursar's Office
                        or Student Conduct, depending on the situation. If your old ID was replaced, it will
                        no longer work if a new one is made.
                     
                     
                     We confiscate duplicate IDs and all non-working IDs.
