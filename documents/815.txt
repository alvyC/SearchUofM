                     The University's policy regarding undergraduate Credit by Exam can be found in the
                        Undergraduate Catalog . Below is a more detailed view of the requirements and process.
                     
                     
                     Who may apply for Credit by Exam?
                     
                     
                        
                        Enrolled/admitted undergraduates must have a 2.000 GPA (combined college level and
                           Transitional Academic Studies courses GPA) in order to apply. If you have been admitted
                           but have not yet enrolled for courses at the U of M, credit earned by exam will be
                           posted after enrollment.
                        
                        
                        You cannot earn Credit by Exam if you have already taken the course for credit.
                        
                     
                     
                     What is the exam like?
                     
                     
                        
                        The details of the exam--method and time--are left to the discretion of colleges and
                           departments.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     What is a passing grade and what does it look like on my student record?
                     
                     
                        
                        To receive credit, your exam grade should be equivalent to at least a "C."
                        
                        If you pass, a grade of "S" (Satisfactory) is entered into your official records.
                        
                     
                     
                     How many courses can I earn credit for through Credit by Examination?
                     
                     
                        
                        You may apply for as many courses as you wish, but each application is subject to
                           the review and approval outlined below.
                        
                        
                     
                     
                     How does it work?
                     
                     Follow the process outlined on the Application for Undergraduate Credit by Examination form. The steps are outlined below. Though you will be most concerned with Student Actions , please read all three lists to understand the process.

                        Print the Undergraduate Credit by Examination form or go to the Registrar's Office, 003 Wilder Tower, and request a copy of the form.
                           Complete section 1 (your personal/enrollment information). The Registrar's Office
                           must complete section 2 (Certification of Eligibility).
                        
                        
                        Next, take the form to the chair of the department offering the course and then to
                           Dean of the College of your major. Both must sign and date your form in section 3
                           (Permission/Review), giving you permission to take the exam.
                        
                        
                        Now, take the signed form to the Bursar's Office to pay the test/course fees. These fees must be paid prior to the exam and are non-refundable.
                        
                        Finally, take the form and the original payment receipt you received from the Bursar (not a copy) to the department
                           offering the course. The department will complete section 4 of the form (Cost), retain
                           the form and administer the test.

                        The department chair should complete and sign section 5 (Certification of Credit by
                           Examination) if the student passes the examination.
                        
                        
                        The department sends/delivers the completed form to the Office of Admissions, Applicant
                           Services, room 101 of Wilder Tower, FAX# 3053.

                        Admissions loads the credit to the student's academic record and then forwards a notice
                           of credit granted to both the student and the Dean of the College of the student's
                           major.
