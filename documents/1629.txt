                        Policy UM1733 which states: Any student or other interested individual may appeal ...any University
                        action connected with fees, charges, refunds, and collection procedures." Parking
                        and traffic fines are excluded since these are handled by separate committees.
                     
                     
                     The Committee will make an advisory recommendation to the Vice President for Business
                        and Finance. If the Vice President concurs with the recommendation, it will be approved.
                        If the Vice President does not concur, the Committee's and the Vice President's recommendations
                        will be submitted to the President, whose decision is final. In either case, the Vice
                        President will advise the appellant of the decision and advise other University offices
                        to implement the decision.
                     
                     
                     The Committee may seek information from any office or person within the University
                        that will assist in making a decision. The appellant may be asked to provide additional
                        information. The Committee may request individuals with relevant information or knowledge
                        to submit information or to appear before the committee. The appellant will always
                        be permitted to appear before the Committee if a request to do so is made, but the
                        committee may prescribe reasonable rules on time allowed and other procedural matters.
                     
                     
                     In making recommendations, the Committee will be concerned with fairness and equal
                        treatment to all individuals in similar situations. In general, the Committee must
                        find reasons why an exception to the University's normal policy or procedure is warranted,
                        as contrasted with simple disagreement with the policy or procedure. Generally, circumstances
                        that are within the University's control OR responsibility should be the basis for
                        an exception. Sympathy with an appellant's situation will not be a major basis for
                        an exception.
                     
                     
                     MEETINGS: The first meeting will be held early in the new school year, preferably in September.
                        Thereafter, meetings will be held as necessary to fulfill the committee's function(s).
                     
                     
                     COMPOSITION: The committee will consist of members including representation of faculty, staff,
                        the student body; the Bursar or his/her designee will serve as an ex-officio, non-voting
                        member.
