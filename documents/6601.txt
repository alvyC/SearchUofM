                        About Dr. Daigle
                        
                        Dr. Daigle joined the Department in 2015. He received his B.S. in Biology from Cornell
                           University with a concentration in Genetics and Development. His Ph.D. research at
                           Stanford University focused on developing and applying bioinformatics tools that integrate
                           biological knowledge with transcriptomics data. In his postdoctoral work, conducted
                           at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Dr. Daigle continued his bioinformatics
                           research while also beginning projects focused on modeling and analysis of stochastic
                           biochemical systems. At the University of Memphis, Dr. Daigle conducts research in
                           both areas. Current projects in his lab involve the integration of genome-scale datasets
                           to identify biomarkers for human disease and the application of computational methods
                           for characterizing promoter architecture from single-cell gene expression data. In
                           addition to his primary appointment in the Department of Biological Sciences, Dr.
                           Daigle has a secondary appointment in the Department of Computer Science and is a
                           faculty affiliate with the Bioinformatics Program.
