                     In this research note, we join the debate between Van Dyke, Kappelman, and Prybutok
                     and Pitt, Watson, and Kavan pertaining to the conceptual and empirical relevance of
                     SERVQUAL as a measure of IS service quality. Adopting arguments from marketing, Van
                     Dyke et al. (1997) question the SERVQUAL gap measurement approach, the interpretation
                     and operationalization of the SERVQUAL expectation construct, and the reliability
                     and validity of SERVQUAL dimensionality. In a response to those arguments, Pitt et
                     al. (1997) defend their previous work (1995) in a point-by-point counterargument that
                     suggests that the marginal empirical benefit of a perceptual-based (SERVPERF) service
                     quality measure does not justify the loss of managerial diagnostic capabilities found
                     in a gap measure. While siding with many of the positions taken by Pitt et al. (1997),
                     we attempt to add value to the debate by presenting discrepancies we have with the
                     two other research teams and by suggesting alternative approaches to resolve, or at
                     least alleviate, problems associated with SERVQUAL. We believe that the theoretical
                     superiority of an alternative IS service quality measure should be backed by empirical
                     evidence in the IS context, hence answering some of the criticism by Van Dyke et al.
                     and offering a construct valid version of the IS-adapted SERVQUAL. From a pragmatic
                     viewpoint, we believe that the justification of using SERVQUAL's gap measure should
                     be driven by more effective ways to utilize expectations in IS service management.
                     To this end, we introduce the newer Parasuraman et al. (1994b) measures, the concept
                     of a "zone of tolerance" for expectation management and an illustration of its practical
                     use in an IS setting. Overall, we attempt to set the direction of where we think this
                     debate should lead the IS field, namely, toward practical and timely IS service quality
                     measures.
