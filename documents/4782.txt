		Payroll Theft Scheme Targeting Universities

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		The University has been made aware of phishing attempts that target university employees.  These malicious activities are usually carried out via email messages that may contain enticing subjects such as mailbox warnings, offers of salary increases, etc.  The email messages may contain links that trick employees into visiting fake websites. These websites appear very similar to the institution’s real web sites and solicit information such as user names and passwords.  The goal, of course, is to trick victims into thinking they are logging into authentic websites.
Employees are urged to use caution when visiting any website that solicits your University of Memphis user name and/or password. University employees should visit the following website for additional information regarding email scams and related security topics: http://www.memphis.edu/its/security/e-mail-scams.php .
Employees who receive suspicious email may forward it to abuse@memphis.edu to confirm whether it is legitimate.
Regards,
Ellen

		eCourseware Issues on August 10, 2014

				
			Posted by  Jude		
			
    
    

		
		On Sunday, August 10, there was an unexpected outage on the eCourseware  (Design2Learn or D2L) system from approximately 2:00 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.  This prevented access for many users.  According to D2L, the cause was due to a power outage at their hosting facility.  Once power was restored, application and storage servers were verified and reconnected.
D2L is a third-party, cloud-based vendor that provides eCourseware to the University.  As such, ITS can work with them on expediting solutions, but unfortunately, cannot prevent such emergencies.
D2L is also contracted through the Tennessee Board of Regents, which limits our ability to affect service improvements.  However, there is currently a TBR committee exploring alternative course management providers through a formal request for proposal process.
Please note that the UofM MyMemphis portal does have a channel available in which ITS posts notices about potential service impacts.  You can also check here for service status “reminders”.
We regret any inconvenience that this may have caused users, and will continue to monitor service levels with D2L.  Thank you for your patience.
Ellen
