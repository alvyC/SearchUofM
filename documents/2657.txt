                     Introduction
                     
                     This page provides information about admission to the MA and PhD programs in philosophy
                        at the University of Memphis. This page is intended as a helpful supplement to the
                        university's Graduate Bulletin (catalog), which takes precedence in any case of conflict. Students should be familiar
                        with the policies and regulations set forth in that document.
                     
                     
                     Admission Requirements
                     
                     Prospective students are admitted in the fall semester of each academic year. Admission
                        is very competitive. The following prerequisites must be met to be considered for
                        admission to either the PhD program or the MA program. (1) A bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university. (2) A minimum of a 2.5 GPA (4.0 scale) (Graduate School requirement). (3) Graduate Record Examination (GRE) taken within the last five years. (4) At least 18 semester hours in undergraduate philosophy courses including the following
                        courses or their equivalent: introduction to philosophy, ethics, elementary logic,
                        intermediate logic, history of ancient philosophy, and history of modern philosophy.
                     
                     
                     A Note on GRE Scores
                     
                     Students applying to the Department of Philosophy graduate programs must take the
                        GRE and submit their scores with their application. (The University of Memphis GRE
                        code is 1459.) There is no minimum score requirement. GRE scores are used as just
                        one part of the overall assessment of a candidate's likely prospects for graduate
                        study. Factors other than the GRE scores are particularly important for the Department's
                        admission decisions. The writing sample, letters of recommendation, the student's
                        GPA generally and specifically in philosophy courses, and the statement of purpose
                        are weighted more heavily than the GRE scores since we have found that these other
                        components of an application are more reliable indicators of a student's readiness
                        for graduate study in philosophy.
                     
                     
                     A Note on Coursework
                     
                     Students lacking any of the required undergraduate courses may be admitted to the
                        program on the condition that the course is taken without graduate credit at the earliest
                        opportunity.
