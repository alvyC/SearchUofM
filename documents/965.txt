                     Bursar's Office The Bursar's Office is responsible for the assessment and collection of student fees.
                        They provide student fee information and general payment guidelines, and disburse
                        financial aid. Here are few things you will find at the Bursar's web site: fee charts,
                        fee payment deadlines, and important fee payment and refund dates.
                     
                     
                     Your University ID - Campus Card The University of Memphis issues each student, faculty and staff member an identification
                        card that bears their name and image. This permanent identification card is used as
                        the primary campus-wide method of determining privileges and accesses. Students must
                        be currently enrolled and a photo identification (such as driver's license or passport)
                        is required to have an identification card made.
                     
                     
                     Crisis Management at the U of M The safety and security of the campus community is a top priority. Parents are encouraged
                        to review the many programs and services offered at the University of Memphis and
                        discuss them with your son, daughter or family member. Whether students live in university
                        housing or off-campus, it is important for them to be aware of their surroundings
                        at all times.
