                     The Montessori Demonstration Track
                     
                     Montessori I Pre-Primary Classroom for age three through kindergarten
                     
                     Our teaching practices and many of our extraordinary materials were developed by Dr.
                        Maria Montessori, physician and educator, and one of the most highly original thinkers
                        of the twentieth century. Her philosophy of education, and our demonstration of it,
                        emphasize respect for young children, independence of spirit, freedom of choice, community
                        feeling, beauty and order in the environment, and the joy of learning.
                     
                     
                     Montessori was one of the first theorists to assert that children learn experientially,
                        through movement and sense perception; accordingly, our curriculum depends on children's
                        independent, "hands-on" exploration of the classroom areas: Practical Life, Art, Sensorial,
                        Math, Language and Geography & Culture, which includes Science. Our Montessori demonstration
                        track is founded upon Montessori's discovery that human beings progress through stages
                        of development characterized by special sensitivities for learning. Children ages
                        three to six are therefore grouped together in the "prepared environment" of the pre-primary
                        classroom, which is configured to suit the specific needs of their stage of development.
                        Since this multi-age grouping is an essential feature of Montessori education, the
                        Montessori demonstration must be considered a three-year-long program.
                     
                     
                     The Reggio Emilia Inspired (RI) Demonstration Track
                     
                     The Reggio Emilia inspired (RI) collaboration includes Preschool I, Preschool II,
                        Preschool III and Kindergarten. Each classroom demonstrates developmentally appropriate practices within the constructivist educational
                        tradition. The demonstration is a learning approach within a social context. Curriculum
                        emerges based on children's observation and experiences of their world.
                     
                     
                     The teacher guides the children's interests into a project where outcomes are determined
                        by the children. Many learning abilities can be satisfied by the collaboration process.
                        With the product becomes part of the process rather than the ending of a project.
                        This upholds the mission of our laboratory demonstration early childhood school for
                        the University of Memphis.
