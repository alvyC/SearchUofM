                     Cognitive Science Graduate Certificate Program (Interdisciplinary)
                     
                     The primary objective of this certificate is to supply graduate students interested
                        in Cognitive Science with interdisciplinary training in the 3 major fields of Cognitive
                        Science, Cognitive Psychology, Artificial Intelligence, and Linguistics. The focus
                        of these courses is to develop core competencies to support research in cognitive
                        science as well as applications in human-computer interaction, information systems,
                        advertising and marketing, and design. While the program will be administered by the
                        Institute for Intelligent Systems, the courses are being taught by seven different
                        departments in four different colleges (Arts and Sciences, Communication Sciences
                        and Disorder, Engineering, and Education).
