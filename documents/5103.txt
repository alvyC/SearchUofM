                        (i.e. 30 hours). Yet the primary reason for withdrawal at 90+ hours is exhausted financial
                        aid and related external situations, such as needing to work full-time to support
                        a family.

                     Since the fall 2013 semester, 258 students have mapped out cost-effective degree completion

                     One such student was Aniysha who had earned 108 credit hours but was unable to finish
                        her degree as planned because her financial aid opportunities were exhausted in the
                        fall 2012 semester. Aniysha was contacted in October 2013 and shared that she had
                        been working to save money to return to the University. Through the Finish Line program,
                        she completed 4 online, self-paced courses that had been pre-assessed by faculty members
                        through the Experiential Learning Credit program. Working with the Finish Line team
                        Aniysha graduated in December earning the bachelor's degree she thought was just out
                        of her reach.

                     Patriot Bank Makes $25,000 Donation to UofM's Finish Line Program
                     
                     June 4, 2015 - Patriot Bank is making a gift of $25,000 to the University of Memphis'
                        Finish Line program. The gift was announced at today's meeting of the Millington Rotary
                        Club.
                     
                     
                     The Finish Line program encourages students who have dropped out after earning 90
                        or more credit hours to return to school to finish their degrees at low or no cost.
                        Many of these students have to abandon their dreams of earning a degree because they
                        have exhausted their financial aid or due to social factors, such as having to work
                        full time to support a family. Finish Line students may take traditional or online
                        courses, and may receive Experiential Learning Credit for knowledge or skills gained
                        outside the University. Some earn credit through national exams. Read More>>>
