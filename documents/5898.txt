                     Multi-faceted. On-going. Evolving. All to help you, find you. 
                     
                     Most students do not enter college knowing exactly what they want to do with their
                        lives. Declaring a major is an on-going, evolving process where you evaluate your
                        interests, strengths, goals, and work closely with an advisor to find your academic
                        path. With the rising cost of education and the burden of student debt hovering, we
                        are focused on helping you find your track as quickly as possible so you can graduate
                        in four years.

                     Noel and Levitz have contributed significantly to our understanding of developmental
                        academic advising by operationalizing O'Banion's model for advisors. They have identified
                        key knowledge and skill areas for advisors within each of O'Banion's sequential tasks.
                        These areas are listed below along with the associated sequential task.
