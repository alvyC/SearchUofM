                     Benefits
                     
                     There are many advantages associated with membership in the Honors Program. Consider
                        just a few of the benefits:
                     
                     
                     Graduating with University Honors
                     
                     Students who fulfill program requirements graduate with University Honors, a designation
                        reflected on the diploma and transcript.
                     
                     
                     Priority Registration Privileges
                     
                     Members of the University Honors Program are eligible to register for classes before
                        the rest of the general student body. This means that honors students are much more
                        likely to get the classes they want at the times they want.
                     
                     
                     Scholarship Service Hours
                     
                     Many scholarships at The University of Memphis require a service obligation to the
                        institution of 75-150 hours per academic year. Because honors courses require significant
                        enrichment activities by the student over and above normal course requirements, scholarship
                        service hours are considered fulfilled for students who are either enrolled in an
