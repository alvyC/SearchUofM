                     Graduate Student Awards
                     
                     The Dr Ralph Faudree Award
                     
                     
                     As officially recorded by the University of Memphis, the family of Ralph Faudree has established an award for PhD students in mathematics.
                     
                     
                     Acknowledged internationally as an outstanding mathematician, Dr. Faudree's interest
                        in and promotion of higher education helped to guide the University of Memphis toward
                        increased standards for academic excellence.
                     
                     
                     Ralph was the first in his family to graduate from college and the first to earn a
                        doctoral degree. Life as a professor of mathematics enabled him to travel the world,
                        meet and work with great mathematicians, and nurture upcoming students at all levels.
                        Teaching and reasearch brought him enormous joy, and both were central to what made
                        his many years of service at the U of M so rewarding. This award was established to
                        encourage others in pursuit of similar goals.
                     
                     
                     Accordingly, the Department of Mathematical Sciences has established the Dr. Ralph
                        Faudree Award, to be given annually to up to two PhD students in Mathematics who have
                        demonstrated excellent progress toward achieving the doctoral degree. It consists
                        of a monetary award of $300 and a certificate of recognition. Eligibility requirements
                        include having passed the Qualifying PhD Exam and a commendable teaching record. Each
                        year, nominees will be invited to give a presentation of their research during Mathematics
                        Research Day. The final decision is made by a jury of department-appointed faculty
                        members.
                     
                     
                     The Department of Mathematical Sciences is very grateful to Pat Faudree for her generous
                        gift aimed at instilling in the new generation of PhD students in Mathematics at the
                        University of Memphis those very same goals of excellence in research and teaching
                        that defined the professional life of Dr. Ralph Faudree. We hope this award will continue,
                        through the contribution of additional donations, for many, many years to come.
