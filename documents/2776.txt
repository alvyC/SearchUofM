                     What is Water on Wheels?
                     
                     The Water on Wheels (WOW) is a mobile learning experience focused on the science of

                     Inside the WOW, educational displays are colorful, interactive and designed to appeal
                        to students in grades 4 and higher. Because the source of drinking water for the Mid
                        South is groundwater, one important display in the WOW spotlights the Memphis aquifer
                        system, a vast underground reservoir with some of the cleanest water on Earth.
                     
                     
                     The WOW is available for viewing at schools and public events around Memphis, Shelby
                        County and the Mid South. Its goal is to educate our community about the source of
                        our drinking water, and the importance of preserving and protecting it.
                     
                     
                     The WOW is an education and outreach program from the Center for Applied Earth Science and Engineering Research (CAESER) , formerly known as the Ground Water Institute. CAESER is committed to applied research excellence, education, and leadership toward building
                        stronger, smarter communities.

            "With each visitor to the WOW mobile we learn more about which questions the public
               wants answers to, sometimes ones we hadn't considered, so we learn as much as we teach
               each time."
