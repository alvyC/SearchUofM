                     Exempt Review
                     
                     Exempt research is research with human subjects. However, it is "exempt" from the
                        provisions stated in 45 CFR 46, Subpart A (Common Rule). An exempt research project
                        does not require ongoing review from the IRB unless the project is amended in such
                        a way that it no longer meets the exemption criteria. (However, institutional policy
                        may have different requirements for obtaining consent as well as continuing review
                        of exempted protocols. Student investigators should consult with their IRB regarding
                        these matters.) The IRB is required to determine if a research project falls under
                        one of the following six exempt categories listed in the federal regulations (45 CFR
                        46.101(b)):
                     
                     
                     
                        
                        Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, involving
                           normal educational practices, such as
                        
                        
                        
                           
                           Research on regular and special education instructional strategies, OR
                           
                           Research on the effectiveness or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula,
                              or classroom management methods.
                           
                           
                        
                        
                        Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude,
                           achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures or observation of public behavior,
                           unless:

                           Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research could reasonably
                              place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects'
                              financial standing, employability, or reputation.

                           that is not exempt under paragraph (2) if
