                     Since noteworthy events happen only occasionally in any data, it is imperative for
                        smart sensors to learn the norms in data so that an appropriate action can be taken
                        at the occurrence of an abnormal or noteworthy event. The aim of this project is to
                        develop algorithms that can learn the norm in terms of a hierarchy of meaningful features
                        from data in an unsupervised and online manner. The application testbed is the problem
                        of automatically tuning cochlear implants (CIs) of patients with severe-to-profound
                        hearing loss by continuously monitoring their speech output.
                     
                     
                     Hearing loss is the most common birth defect in the U.S. with slightly over 15,000
                        new pediatric cases each year and societal losses amounting to $4.6 billion over a
                        lifetime. The working hypothesis is that deficiencies in hearing for people with significant
                        hearing loss are reflected in their speech production. This project will develop and
                        use unsupervised, online, and biologically plausible machine learning algorithms to
                        learn feature hierarchies from the speech output data of severely-to-profoundly hearing-impaired
                        patients. The learned feature hierarchy from the speech of a patient will be compared
                        to those learned from the speech of a comparable normal hearing population. Deficiencies
                        in the patient's hearing will be ascertained by identifying the missing or distorted
                        features. Algorithms will be developed to map this information into the signal processing
                        strategies used in CIs to enhance the audibility of speech.
