                        About Dr. Lessman
                        
                        Dr. Charles A. Lessman joined the Faculty in 1988 as an associate professor and in
                           1993 he was promoted to the rank of professor. Dr. Lessman received his Ph.D. from
                           the Department of Genetics & Cell Biology at the University of Minnesota. He was a
                           Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Population Dynamics, at the Johns
                           Hopkins University. He served as an assistant then associate Professor at St. Francis
                           Xavier University in Nova Scotia, Canada and currently is a Professor in the Department
                           of Biological Sciences at the University of Memphis. He has been a visiting professor
                           at the University of Iowa, the Vanderbilt University and at St. Jude Children's Research
                           Hospital. Dr. Lessman's research focus is on reproductive and developmental biology
                           and he has employed a number of different model organisms but most recently has used
                           zebrafish. He teaches Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, Cell Physiology, Vertebrate
                           Cell Culture and offers Undergraduate and Graduate research projects on zebrafish
                           genetics, reproduction and development.
