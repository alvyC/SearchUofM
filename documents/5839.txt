                        About Timothy Shiu
                        
                        Timothy Shiu, Associate Professor of Violin and a member of the Ceruti String Quartet,
                           received his principal training from the Juilliard School, the Peabody Conservatory,
                           the Cleveland Institute of Music, and Yale University, where he graduated summa cum
                           laude with a B.A. in English. Mr. Shiu brings together in his artistry a diverse lineage
                           of influences from his various principal mentors. As a result of his early formative
                           years of study with Louise Behrend, he traces a line through her teacher, Louis Persinger,
                           to the Franco-Belgian school of Eugène Ysaÿe. In addition, his work under the tutelage
                           of Donald Weilerstein connects him to the highly influential school of Ivan Galamian
                           and Dorothy Delay. Further study with Victor Danchenko has brought him into contact
                           with the Russian school of David Oistrakh. Other major teachers include Sindey Harth
                           and the late Joseph Fuchs, who himself was a pupil of the legendary Franz Kneisel.
                        
                        
                        An active recitalist and chamber musician, Mr. Shiu has concertized extensively throughout
                           the United States in venues including Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall, the Kennedy
                           Center's Terrace Theater, the Aspen Music Festival's Harris Hall, the Interlochen
                           Arts Institute's Corson Auditorium, the New School's Schneider Concert Series, and
                           Chamber Music Northwest. International engagements have included performances in Italy,
                           Japan, Korea, Canada, and Brazil. Mr. Shiu is currently a member of the Ceruti String
                           Quartet and was also previously a founding member of the Maia Quartet, with whom he
                           played for thirteen years. In addition, he has collaborated with members of the Guarneri,
                           Muir, and Borromeo String Quartets, as well as with violist Roger Chase, cellist Patrick
                           Demenga, pianist Ann Schein, and the late flutist Samuel Baron.
