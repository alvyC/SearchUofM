                     Although online social network services (OSNS), e.g., Facebook, Twitter, MySpace,
                        LinkedIn, are enjoying rampant popularity, a subsection of the population (i.e., nonadopters)
                        continues to forgo using them. Our study is one of the first to focus exclusively
                        on what might motivate nonadopters to accept a widely adopted IT. By considering nonadopters'
                        inertia within the context of early stages of innovation diffusion and incorporating
                        status quo bias theory into well-established technology acceptance model (TAM) relationships,
                        this study uncovers the finding that people who report that they do not use OSNS would
                        use them if they thought OSNS were easier and more enjoyable to use, and if they were
                        persuaded by others to use them. Our findings suggest these nonadopters do not see
                        the usefulness of OSNS, risks of sharing personal information publically, or the perceived
                        amount of effort in using OSNS as factors that influence potential acceptance and
                        use of the technology. This study contributes to research by offering an integrated
                        theoretical framework that updates TAM with status quo bias theory to study nonadopters
                        and offers IS practice guidelines for OSNS providers to attract nonadopters to accept
                        and use the technology.
