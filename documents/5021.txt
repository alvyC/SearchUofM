                     The 1st Annual Research Workshop on Advances and Innovations in Cyber Security is
                        scheduled at the University of Memphis' FedEx Institute of Technology in Memphis, Tennessee on June 9-10, 2016. The workshop aims to bring together the
                        very best research and industry practice on the subject of Cyber Security. We invite
                        submissions related to all theoretical and practical aspects of cyber security including
                        cyber behavioral, systems, software, health, risk, threats, law and business.
                     
                     
                     The workshop will be a mixture of presentations and open discussions. Attendees from
                        both academia and industry will benefit greatly from the open exchange of ideas and
                        methodologies on cyber security.
