                     FedEx Institute's Office of Technology Transfer Awards Technology Development Grants
                     
                     August 18, 2016 - The Office of Technology Transfer of the FedEx Institute of Technology
                        recently awarded Technology Development Grants to five researchers across the University.
                        These grants, awarded for the 2016-2017 academic year, are to promote faculty innovations
                        plus support the protection and commercialization of inventions made by faculty and
                        researchers.
                     
                     
                     In order to encourage and enable the development of the most commercially promising
                        technologies, the Institute awarded five competitive grants of $20,000 each in a one-time
                        allocation to help drive their inventions closer to commercial development and licensing.
                        These grants were awarded to the following recipients/projects and have clearly identified
                        the next steps or milestones in moving their projects forward:
                     
                     
                     Dr. Bashir Morshed – "Fully-passive Wireless Continuous Temperature Sensing System Using Low-cost Inkjet
                        Printed Disposable Body-worn Sensors." Prototypes will be developed on flexible substrates
                        of paper as low-cost, body-worn, disposable electronic patches. The scanner device
                        will be prototyped using an embedded design process. Another aspect of the project
                        is to develop an Android app for interfacing the scanner device and show the temperature;
                     
                     
                     Dr. Dipankar Dasgupta – "The Development of an Adaptive Multi-factor Authentication Framework." The goal
                        is to develop this Adaptive-MFA for use in mobile devices to develop the client application
                        to support mobile devices in most widely used Android platform, and to improve the
                        performance of the surrounding condition sensors for desktop environment;
                     
                     
                     Dr. Firouzeh Sabri – "Lightweight Flexible Temperature Sensor Kit for Biologics." The next steps involve
                        finalizing the design of the hand-held detector and the optics that must be integrated
                        into the unit, connect and test the detector to the app of a smart phone, test it
                        under various environmental conditions, and identify kit options so that potential
                        clients can chose custom-specific kit components;
                     
                     
                     Dr. Joel Bumgardner – "Chitosan Nanofiber Composition, Composition Comprising Modified Chitosan, and
                        Method of Use" to demonstrate the compatibility of the membranes with bone grafts.
                        The next milestones then are to evaluate the chitosan membranes with a synthetic bone
                        graft in a rodent model and move to large (pig or canine) pre-clinical models; and
                     
                     
                     Dr. Susan Elswick – "ENGAGE: An API Capable Data Collection and Analysis System for Education and Behavioral
                        Health." Key objectives for Phase I research include the need to make the ENGAGE system
                        API and IoT compatible. Once the ENGAGE system is equipped to manage API and IoTs,
                        then work can begin on a specific IoT tools that are efficient in data collection,
                        practical for the classroom setting and cost effective.
                     
                     
                     As part of the award, recipients are required to submit a final report detailing all
                        progress and accomplishments, which are funded by or related to this grant. Final
                        reports are to be submitted by the end of June 2017.
