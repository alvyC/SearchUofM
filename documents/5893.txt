                     Freshmen meet with their academic advisor for the first time at New Student Orientation.
                        The first advising appointment is a chance to meet the advisor and get acquainted.
                        In addition, freshmen will plan for the first semester of classes during this meeting.
                        To get prepared for academic advising at New Student Orientation , the new freshman should complete and submit Preparation for Academic Advising . Students who are admitted as freshmen for the spring or summer semester will meet
                        one on one with an academic advisor.
                     
                     
                     Future meetings with the academic advisor will help the freshman student clarify academic,
                        career, and personal goals. The relationship with the academic advisor is enhanced
                        by the active participation of the student.
