Modern world-wide-web contains too much information that it is almost impossible for a human
being to search it manually for relevant information. According to W.H. Auden, The greatest
problem of today is how to teach people to ignore the irrelevant, how to refuse to know things,
before they are suffocated. For too many facts are as bad as none at all". We need an automated
information retrieval system to and the relevant pages on internet based on some query written in
natural language. This searching should be computationally inexpensive because we have too
much diverse things know. To make this problem more challenging, worldwide web is growing
at an exponential rate [1] and its contents are not static. We are in need of a search engine that
can address three things. Firstly, it is capable to return relevant pages in web corpus. Secondly,
searching should be fast. Thirdly, it is capable to order the search results based on the similarity
with search query and most relevant pages is at the beginning of the results.
